With the confidence of popularity, her government is positioned to promote political ideas that were almost beyond imagination only a few months ago. One of them, mooted on Wednesday, is encouraging the country into a four-day working week.</p> \n<p>Ardern\u2019s leadership of New Zealand through the coronavirus crisis has compounded credentials well established by her government\u2019s deft and empathetic handling of the horrific massacre in Christchurch last year. When corona hit, the lockdown of the country was swift, draconian and effective; there have only been 21 deaths from the disease to date in New Zealand, and while the rest of the world grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX01vcm5pbmdNYWlsQVVTLTIwMDUyMA%3D%3D&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=MorningMailAUS&amp;CMP=morningmailau_email\">rising number of daily cases</a>, no new cases have been reported in New Zealand in three days.</p> \n<p>A mind-boggling 92% of New Zealanders laud their government\u2019s containment efforts.

Hard-hit <a href=\"https://tia.org.nz/about-the-industry/quick-facts-and-figures/\">tourism</a> is New Zealand\u2019s largest export industry, employing 15% of New Zealanders and contributing to almost 6% of GDP, and it was in the context of rescuing this industry that on Wednesday Ardern suggested \u2013 informally, in a Facebook Live video from the tourist town of Rotorua \u2013 that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/jacinda-ardern-flags-four-day-working-week-as-way-to-rebuild-new-zealand-after-covid-19\">should the country move to a four-day working week, more leisure time may allow the domestic tourist market to expand to meet the present shortfall.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fd228700-5ebb-4859-877a-621da0e55762\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rBfLUe4BpU4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The phrasing was careful. \u201cI hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees,\u201d Ardern said.</p> \n<p>But the mere suggestion has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/jacinda-ardern-flags-four-day-working-week-as-way-to-rebuild-new-zealand-after-covid-19\">\u201cexcited New Zealanders\u201d</a>, as well as exciting a ready audience of the corona generation around the world. When Ardern explained that \u201cthere\u2019s just so much we\u2019ve learned about \u2026 [the flexibility] of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that\u201d, she was speaking to the lived, material reality of the most physically transformed workplaces in living western memory.</p> \n<p>Because across the world, social distancing has resulted not only in record numbers of people working from home. It has staggered and rearranged shifts, reorganising the deployment of labour around continually improvised new systems of production, distribution and exchange demanded in a health and economic crisis. Economists have called it <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-could-spark-a-working-from-home-revolution/12119338\">the biggest workforce change since the second world war,</a> and parallel to the ongoing horror of managing an invisible, lethal virus that underscores every rearrangement, for some workers there have been surprising benefits.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s usually in the secrecy of social media group chats you\u2019ll read the most explicit admissions from people \u2013 and a little guilt \u2013 that they\u2019re enjoying the new schedules and enforced time at home. Parents may find the juggle of home-schooling their kids with work commitments challenging, but many are appreciating more time with their children.</p> \n<p>In a workplace culture that in so many places still \u2013 still \u2013 operates around a culturally persistent <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/safe-and-strong-victorian-gender-equality\">male-breadwinner model</a> that distances men from caring responsibilities in the home, many men are gaining closeness and meaning from greater daily involvement with their kids.</p> \n<p>Women are seeing practical opportunities materialise for post-Covid-19 employment with genuine flexibility for meeting care commitments. Those who seem to be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/5/15/21258855/coronavirus-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-cancer\">doing the best psychologically</a> out of these extreme times are those whose days now accommodate doing things for the community, and acts of care. In my own experience, my partner and I are happier in ourselves and our relationship for losing the stress of our commute and spending more time in our own home together.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/i-pioneered-the-4-day-week-now-it-must-be-used-to-fight-the-climate-crisis\">I pioneered the four-day week \u2013 now policymakers must adopt it to fight the climate crisis | Andrew Barnes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A universal four-day week in itself is no panacea for relationships, workplace frustration, for rescuing an economy or for meeting every household\u2019s care commitments \u2013 but it\u2019s Ardern\u2019s suggestion that it be considered within a mix of work changes by employers that\u2019s important here.

      "bodyText": "The popularity of New Zealand\u2019s Labour prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is, presently, stratospheric. With the confidence of popularity, her government is positioned to promote political ideas that were almost beyond imagination only a few months ago. One of them, mooted on Wednesday, is encouraging the country into a four-day working week. Ardern\u2019s leadership of New Zealand through the coronavirus crisis has compounded credentials well established by her government\u2019s deft and empathetic handling of the horrific massacre in Christchurch last year. When corona hit, the lockdown of the country was swift, draconian and effective; there have only been 21 deaths from the disease to date in New Zealand, and while the rest of the world grapples with a rising number of daily cases, no new cases have been reported in New Zealand in three days. A mind-boggling 92% of New Zealanders laud their government\u2019s containment efforts. According to latest polls, Ardern is the most popular party leader there in more than 100 years. With an impending opportunity to restructure the New Zealand economy for post-corona reopening, Ardern is exploring a policy suite of uncommon ambition. Hard-hit tourism is New Zealand\u2019s largest export industry, employing 15% of New Zealanders and contributing to almost 6% of GDP, and it was in the context of rescuing this industry that on Wednesday Ardern suggested \u2013 informally, in a Facebook Live video from the tourist town of Rotorua \u2013 that, should the country move to a four-day working week, more leisure time may allow the domestic tourist market to expand to meet the present shortfall. The phrasing was careful. \u201cI hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees,\u201d Ardern said. But the mere suggestion has \u201cexcited New Zealanders\u201d, as well as exciting a ready audience of the corona generation around the world. When Ardern explained that \u201cthere\u2019s just so much we\u2019ve learned about \u2026 [the flexibility] of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that\u201d, she was speaking to the lived, material reality of the most physically transformed workplaces in living western memory. Because across the world, social distancing has resulted not only in record numbers of people working from home. It has staggered and rearranged shifts, reorganising the deployment of labour around continually improvised new systems of production, distribution and exchange demanded in a health and economic crisis. Economists have called it the biggest workforce change since the second world war, and parallel to the ongoing horror of managing an invisible, lethal virus that underscores every rearrangement, for some workers there have been surprising benefits. It\u2019s usually in the secrecy of social media group chats you\u2019ll read the most explicit admissions from people \u2013 and a little guilt \u2013 that they\u2019re enjoying the new schedules and enforced time at home. Parents may find the juggle of home-schooling their kids with work commitments challenging, but many are appreciating more time with their children. In a workplace culture that in so many places still \u2013 still \u2013 operates around a culturally persistent male-breadwinner model that distances men from caring responsibilities in the home, many men are gaining closeness and meaning from greater daily involvement with their kids. Women are seeing practical opportunities materialise for post-Covid-19 employment with genuine flexibility for meeting care commitments. Those who seem to be doing the best psychologically out of these extreme times are those whose days now accommodate doing things for the community, and acts of care. In my own experience, my partner and I are happier in ourselves and our relationship for losing the stress of our commute and spending more time in our own home together. A universal four-day week in itself is no panacea for relationships, workplace frustration, for rescuing an economy or for meeting every household\u2019s care commitments \u2013 but it\u2019s Ardern\u2019s suggestion that it be considered within a mix of work changes by employers that\u2019s important here. There\u2019s no doubt that there are workers who would thrive in a four-day week \u2013 but there are others who\u2019d prosper through more shifts but with fewer hours, those who\u2019d be happier working full-time from home, others who\u2019d be most productive through a different combination of conditions. But what can and will provide the capital injection needed to revive economies, a boost in productivity and the potential for a real work-life balance for working people lies in the twinned scenarios a four-day week inherently proposes. The first is adjusting pay-scales to provide the equivalent of a living wage based upon four days of full-time labour, which would both allow underemployment to be liveable and to flush greater spending towards consumer markets that are suffering. The second is a new workplace paradigm that Ardern\u2019s casual menu of ideas politically suggests: one that upends four decades of neoliberal insistence that workplace \u201cflexibility\u201d is the purview only of employers, replacing it with a truly social-democratic flexibility that serves, through working people, the households and communities that their jobs support. Among a claque of western leaders yearning for \u201csnap back\u201d to the way things were before the virus \u2013 some pursuing \u201crecovery\u201d strategies of even lesser benefit \u2013 it\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s, conspicuously, who repeatedly shows the courage to snap forward.

      "body": "<p>It was the most exciting day of Lucas Plapp\u2019s life. He was only 19, but when his coach Tim Decker called to say he\u2019d been selected for the Australian Olympic team, it was the fulfilment of a childhood dream.</p> <p>It was 18 March. Plapp was a long shot to make the five-man team for the endurance track event at the Tokyo Olympics, but his performance at the world championships a few weeks before pushed him into contention. \u201cIt was my goal and what I wanted to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if others thought it was possible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98eb64aa828207f6d54bc0a20576b027861e962c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98eb64aa828207f6d54bc0a20576b027861e962c/0_94_1080_986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian cyclist Luke Plapp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"913\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Plapp is the youngest member of Australia\u2019s Olympic cycling team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cycling Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everything happened quickly. Cycling Australia\u2019s communications manager Amy McCann called to let him know there would be a cheesy media event in Adelaide, with the team dressed in kimonos. The event was cancelled because the coronavirus threat made it too risky.</p> <p>A few days later, the Australian Olympic Committee decided that athletes would not compete in the July Games due to the pandemic. Plapp and his teammates reeled because at that stage, the Games were still officially going ahead and the thought of missing them was unthinkable. On 24 March, barely a week after Plapp\u2019s selection, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\"> Olympics were postponed until next year.</a></p> <p>Plapp admits he didn\u2019t see the bigger picture at the time. \u201cWe were in such a bubble we didn\u2019t realise how big [coronavirus] was,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were so driven and committed to the Games. In our heads, that was a date that we\u2019d looked forward to for so long that it was like, nothing can stop this happening.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting so hyped and it\u2019s so close to happening and you\u2019re about to start your final preparations and now it\u2019s 16 months [away] and you almost restart your whole process again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plapp is the youngest member of a team that includes the more seasoned riders Kelland O\u2019Brien, Alexander Porter, Samuel Welsford and Leigh Howard. Tokyo will be his first Olympics.</p> <p>Cycling is based in Adelaide and Plapp has lived and trained there since he was 17. He played cricket and football as a child, but became fascinated with the Olympics, staying up late to watch Australians compete at the Beijing Games in 2008. He looked for an Olympic sport, took up cycling, and decided to dedicate himself to it after he had success in the under-19s world championships.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s quite weird to restart the whole thing, knowing how hard that training block was, to have to put your body through that again.</p> <footer> <cite>Lucas Plapp</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe reason I love the sport so much is whoever trains the hardest usually wins.\u201d</p> <p>When the Games were postponed, coach Decker told the team to take two weeks off if they wanted, just to absorb the decision. \u201cGiven the shock and the emotion that the athletes were going through, it was trying to get them to put that aside and really think about their passion as to why they ride their bikes,\u201d Decker says.</p> <p>Plapp has remained in isolation at his parents\u2019 home in Melbourne. Cycling Australia dismantled its gym, shipping pieces to athletes so they could continue to train. Plapp set up a gym in the lounge room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f28a55a84a565d521ec47610249de0d4c8975027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f28a55a84a565d521ec47610249de0d4c8975027/0_312_735_855/430.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Plapp trains at home in his parents\u2019 lounge room in Melbourne.\" width=\"430\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Plapp trains at home in his parents\u2019 lounge room in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Plapp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such circumstances pose psychological and practical challenges for athletes. Plapp\u2019s event is the team pursuit, part of the track endurance program. A team of four speed around 16 laps of the velodrome, or 4km in all.</p> <p>Training is intense and designed to ensure that athletes peak at the right time. As Plapp explains it, the early focus is on long rides to reach peak fitness \u2013 500-600km a week. In the few months before the Games, the focus moves to track work with an emphasis on speed. Tokyo was so close that the team was about to enter the final stages of training, but now it\u2019s back to long rides.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite weird to restart the whole thing,\u201d says Plapp, \u201cknowing how hard that training block was, to have to put your body through that again.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks ago, Plapp was out riding in Melbourne when he hit a pothole and broke his collarbone, which meant rest and limited training. The team\u2019s nutritionist, Jill Leckey, was the first to message him after the accident. \u201cFor her, you cannot have enough protein,\u201d he says. \u201cShe express-posted a massive 5kg box of nutrition to me and said: make sure you finish all of this.\u201d</p> <p>Since the Adelaide hub closed, the team has taken advantage of technology. Online training means the team can ride together virtually. There\u2019s even a program that allows anyone in the world to join Olympic cyclists on a ride.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s been really cool,\u201d says Plapp. \u201c[The technology has] been available before, but we\u2019ve really made the most of it now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"900d843b086a01e7ba182b10af01894487dbe751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/900d843b086a01e7ba182b10af01894487dbe751/0_83_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Plapp competes in the 2020 UCI Track World Championships in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Plapp will be heading back to Adelaide to train next week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Casey B Gibson/Cycling Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plapp has been meeting up with his mentor, former champion swimmer Libby Trickett, on Zoom.

      "bodyText": "It was the most exciting day of Lucas Plapp\u2019s life. He was only 19, but when his coach Tim Decker called to say he\u2019d been selected for the Australian Olympic team, it was the fulfilment of a childhood dream. It was 18 March. Plapp was a long shot to make the five-man team for the endurance track event at the Tokyo Olympics, but his performance at the world championships a few weeks before pushed him into contention. \u201cIt was my goal and what I wanted to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if others thought it was possible.\u201d Everything happened quickly. Cycling Australia\u2019s communications manager Amy McCann called to let him know there would be a cheesy media event in Adelaide, with the team dressed in kimonos. The event was cancelled because the coronavirus threat made it too risky. A few days later, the Australian Olympic Committee decided that athletes would not compete in the July Games due to the pandemic. Plapp and his teammates reeled because at that stage, the Games were still officially going ahead and the thought of missing them was unthinkable. On 24 March, barely a week after Plapp\u2019s selection, the Olympics were postponed until next year. Plapp admits he didn\u2019t see the bigger picture at the time. \u201cWe were in such a bubble we didn\u2019t realise how big [coronavirus] was,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were so driven and committed to the Games. In our heads, that was a date that we\u2019d looked forward to for so long that it was like, nothing can stop this happening. \u201cYou\u2019re getting so hyped and it\u2019s so close to happening and you\u2019re about to start your final preparations and now it\u2019s 16 months [away] and you almost restart your whole process again.\u201d Plapp is the youngest member of a team that includes the more seasoned riders Kelland O\u2019Brien, Alexander Porter, Samuel Welsford and Leigh Howard. Tokyo will be his first Olympics. Cycling is based in Adelaide and Plapp has lived and trained there since he was 17. He played cricket and football as a child, but became fascinated with the Olympics, staying up late to watch Australians compete at the Beijing Games in 2008. He looked for an Olympic sport, took up cycling, and decided to dedicate himself to it after he had success in the under-19s world championships. \u201cThe reason I love the sport so much is whoever trains the hardest usually wins.\u201d When the Games were postponed, coach Decker told the team to take two weeks off if they wanted, just to absorb the decision. \u201cGiven the shock and the emotion that the athletes were going through, it was trying to get them to put that aside and really think about their passion as to why they ride their bikes,\u201d Decker says. Plapp has remained in isolation at his parents\u2019 home in Melbourne. Cycling Australia dismantled its gym, shipping pieces to athletes so they could continue to train. Plapp set up a gym in the lounge room. Such circumstances pose psychological and practical challenges for athletes. Plapp\u2019s event is the team pursuit, part of the track endurance program. A team of four speed around 16 laps of the velodrome, or 4km in all. Training is intense and designed to ensure that athletes peak at the right time. As Plapp explains it, the early focus is on long rides to reach peak fitness \u2013 500-600km a week. In the few months before the Games, the focus moves to track work with an emphasis on speed. Tokyo was so close that the team was about to enter the final stages of training, but now it\u2019s back to long rides. \u201cIt\u2019s quite weird to restart the whole thing,\u201d says Plapp, \u201cknowing how hard that training block was, to have to put your body through that again.\u201d A few weeks ago, Plapp was out riding in Melbourne when he hit a pothole and broke his collarbone, which meant rest and limited training. The team\u2019s nutritionist, Jill Leckey, was the first to message him after the accident. \u201cFor her, you cannot have enough protein,\u201d he says. \u201cShe express-posted a massive 5kg box of nutrition to me and said: make sure you finish all of this.\u201d Since the Adelaide hub closed, the team has taken advantage of technology. Online training means the team can ride together virtually. There\u2019s even a program that allows anyone in the world to join Olympic cyclists on a ride. \u201cThat\u2019s been really cool,\u201d says Plapp. \u201c[The technology has] been available before, but we\u2019ve really made the most of it now.\u201d Plapp has been meeting up with his mentor, former champion swimmer Libby Trickett, on Zoom. The mentorship was part of a Sport Australia Hall of Fame scholarship Plapp was awarded last year. \u201cShe\u2019s been really helpful with the Olympics being postponed and also preparing and training for the Games.\u201d He is heading back to Adelaide next week. The sling on his arm is gone, and he\u2019ll be ready for full training in a couple of weeks. The Adelaide Super-Drome has not yet re-opened, but modified training has started, subject to government restrictions. Training times will be staggered, and there\u2019ll be fewer teams on the track at once. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new plan,\u201d Plapp says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start everything over, and we\u2019re really motivated again.\u201d Postcards from the pandemic looks at how everyday Australians are coping with immense changes coronavirus has brought to their lives. We\u2019d like to hear your story about how you are managing during this crisis. Email: postcards@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Egyptian doctors are increasingly at odds with their own government on the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, pleading for protections and a full lockdown even as the authorities urge people to learn to \u201ccoexist\u201d with Covid-19. A wave of government propaganda has hailed healthcare workers as the \u201cwhite army\u201d, a reference to their white coats. But some of them told the Guardian they lacked protective equipment and were struggling to get vital tests for themselves and patients. \u201cThe situation is deteriorating. The nurses and doctors are very scared because we are not protected,\u201d said a nurse at a hospital in Imbaba, Giza. \u201cWe are treated the same way patients are treated. If we complain of symptoms, we are asked to go home and quarantine, but we are not allowed to be tested.\u201d In early May a ministry of health official told a parliamentary committee that quarantine hospitals were full, and doctors complained on social media of having to turn infected people away. Egypt has registered 14,229 cases of Covid-19 and 680 deaths. Some 745 new cases were recorded on 20 May, the highest one-day total so far. About 13% of those infected are medical professionals, according to the World Health Organization. \u201cSome doctors say those who had symptoms earlier are much luckier than us, as if you got Covid-19 earlier, you got a hospital place,\u201d said one medical worker at a Giza hospital. \u201cIf you get it nowadays, you won\u2019t get a place.\u201d He blamed the state for the spread of Covid-19, pointing to a profound shortage of protective equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. Catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cMany doctors say they [the government] don\u2019t care about us.\u201d He deplored the Egyptian government\u2019s boast of supplying PPE to Italy, America and the UK while doctors in Egypt faced shortages. \u201cThings got much worse recently. Doctors working on Covid-19 seeking to get PCR tests [tests to see whether they are infected] for themselves find their requests denied many times. \u201cHospitals are collapsing. They have to turn away people who come in with symptoms, but these people have no other options as all places are full.\u201d Egypt\u2019s health ministry spokesman, Khaled Megahed, was not available when contacted for comment. The Egyptian Medical Syndicate \u2013 a representative body for healthcare workers that is partially state-controlled \u2013 has repeatedly demanded that the government change course and demanded more PCR tests. The syndicate head, Hussein Khairy, and Cairo chapter head Sherine Ghaleb wrote to the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, in early May demanding a full lockdown for the last two weeks of the Ramadan holy month to deal a \u201cswift knockout\u201d to the virus, warning of a surge in cases if no further action was taken. The government declined to impose a lockdown, and health committee members stressed the need to protect Egypt\u2019s fragile economy by \u201ccoexisting with the virus\u201d while maintaining social distancing measures. Officials imposed a nighttime curfew in late March, then it reduced it by two hours at the end of April. Shopping malls, banks and mass transit systems stayed open even as case numbers grew. Government officials have declared a new 5pm to 6am curfew during the upcoming six-day Eid al-Fitr break, including the temporary closure of shops and beaches. While health ministry and cabinet officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to \u201ccoexist\u201d with the virus, Madbouly has declared that the country will \u201creturn to normal\u201d after the Eid holiday. Citizens must wear face masks in public, he said, but the government will now consider reopening restaurants, gyms and places of worship. Multiple Egyptian officials have blamed citizens for the spread of the virus despite the lax restrictions, including the head of the cabinet\u2019s crisis management unit, who lamented the \u201clack of commitment from some citizens\u201d. The country has 1.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and recently accepted a $2.8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund to aid an economy where a third of citizens live below the poverty line, unable to abstain from daily low-paid work. The rise in cases has been accompanied by confusion about the number of PCR tests conducted in Egypt, which in late April was using less than half its testing capacity according to the WHO, which implored Egypt to scale up its efforts. An Egyptian presidential adviser for health claimed in early May that the country had conducted \u201cover a million\u201d tests, a figure later retracted by the State Information Service, which said \u201cmore than 105,000 tests\u201d had been carried out. The British embassy in Cairo announced this week that Southampton company Primer Design provided 40,000 PCR test kits to Egypt, while the health ministry said 320 additional public hospitals would be able to test for and examine suspected cases. \u201cWe do not want to be called the \u2018white army\u2019,\u201d said a doctor at the Hussein University hospital in Cairo. \u201cWe want the same social protection and financial rights that the army and officials have. Believe me, doctors do not want songs or titles \u2013 we just want to be able to do our job safely.\u201d",

Others had been dressed in T-shirts or were holding placards advertising a sex toy seller and a popular online streamer who apparently inspired their design, media reports said. The club apologised for causing \u201cdeep concern\u201d to fans, but claimed the dolls had been delivered due to a \u201cmix-up\u201d with the supplier, adding that it had received assurances before the match they were not intended for sexual purposes. On Thursday, the K-League fined FC Seoul a record 100m won ($81,000), saying the club had \u201cdeeply humiliated\u201d female football fans and damaged the 38-year-old league\u2019s reputation. After reviewing the case, league officials accepted FC Seoul\u2019s claim that it did not know the mannequins were sex toys, but said it \u201ccould have easily recognised their use using common sense and experience\u201d. The league said in a statement: \u201cThe controversy over this \u2018real doll\u2019 incident has deeply humiliated and hurt women fans, and damaged the integrity of the league.\u201d FC Seoul, the 2016 league champions, accepted the decision, apologised and promised to prevent a repeat of the incident. Earlier this month the K-League became the world\u2019s first major football league to start playing after South Korea succeeded in containing the virus. The season had been due to begin in late February, at the height of the country\u2019s outbreak. Spectators are banned from stadiums, however, with clubs attempting to fill up stands with cardboard cutouts, placards and banners, and create a semblance of atmosphere with crowd noises pumped through PA systems. Many were unconvinced by FC Seoul\u2019s claim that it believed the dolls were fashion mannequins. \u201cI wonder how they even came up with this bizarre idea. This is an international disgrace,\u201d said one online critic.",

      "body": "<p>Just before lockdown, 29-year-old Ala Uddin became ill with coronavirus-related symptoms and had to self-isolate in his London flat. \u201cFor 23 days I was relying on video calls,\u201d he says. \u201cI hardly used them before, but now it was the only way I could see anyone and communicate with my housemate, even though we were living in rooms next to each other.\u201d Uddin was also regularly video-calling his parents and siblings in York, as well as family members in Bangladesh, all of whom were checking in to make sure he was coping. \u201cWithout video calls I don\u2019t know how I could have got through that time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Since the pandemic hit, Zoom, FaceTime, Houseparty, Microsoft Teams and all manner of other video-calling apps have become so engrained in our lives. As one of the only safe ways to communicate, it\u2019s hard to imagine living without them. None of these have taken off quite like Zoom. At the end of December, the app reported a maximum of 10 million daily users. By March, <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/\" title=\"\">200 million</a> people were on it each day to work, socialise, view lessons and lectures, sing in choirs, attend church, birthday parties and weddings, meet new babies, say final words to dying family members and observe Ramadan and Easter. So embedded are these apps in all parts of life now that when Zoom went down last weekend, it made headlines around the world and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/17/widespread-technical-issues-with-zoom-hits-uk-covid-19-briefing\" title=\"\">halted the Downing Street press conference</a>.</p> <p>For many of us, Zoom, and apps like it, are a necessary frustration \u2013 the technical glitches, the pixellated faces, the exhaustingly long meetings with colleagues with their bookcases in the background \u2013 are the price we pay for preventing the spread of a pandemic. But for others, many of them elderly or disabled, the Zoom boom has helped them become more sociable than before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"614ec917866f769539c30dfe1528fc23eb2640f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/614ec917866f769539c30dfe1528fc23eb2640f6/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dog on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Julie Taylor, 61, who is retired and lives in Wiltshire, had never used video-calling before the lockdown began, but now talks to her friends every day via Zoom. \u201cMy neighbour Ben, who is 15, told me about it and helped me set it all up by calling instructions over the fence. It\u2019s made me realise what I was missing out on before,\u201d she says. \u201cI live on my own and so calling my friends each day or calling into the weekly public council meetings has been doing a lot of good for me when I feel down in the dumps.\u201d Similarly, Uddin\u2019s grandmother in York has been lent a tablet with video-calling software. \u201cIt was so emotional seeing her once she got it working,\u201d he says. \u201cSince she hasn\u2019t been able to go out at all, I could see how comforted she was just by having my face there and knowing that we\u2019re all safe.\u201d</p> <p>When Emma Critchley-Lloyd, 31, a marketer living in London, started a Saturday night Zoom quiz with her family, she didn\u2019t realise it would bring them into contact more regularly than before. \u201cA lot of my relatives aren\u2019t very good with technology and I\u2019ve never even needed to have their email addresses before,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing each other more than we would before lockdown and I hope we can keep it going afterwards \u2026 It\u2019s been something to look forward to each week, even though it can be an effort to get on a video call after a day of work Zooms.\u201d</p> <p>The psychologist Dr Doreen Dodgen-Magee sees video-calling as being an essential but contentious part of our lives. \u201cAs social animals, we fail to thrive when we can\u2019t have meaningful connections with others, so video-calling is really important at the moment for helping us feel part of a community,\u201d she says. But it is not without its flaws. \u201cSpeaking over video is such a static way of connecting with people. We\u2019re used to a full sensory experience, which is lost when we\u2019re limited to a small square of someone\u2019s face with audio delays. Plus, we\u2019re always seeing our own faces, so there\u2019s a constant sense of internal judgment on how we look and the distraction of where we should even be looking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b96605595b12d06efd696bd7fa735d611930665d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b96605595b12d06efd696bd7fa735d611930665d/0_0_1276_909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Party on Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aside from the oddness of seeing our own faces in conversation \u2013 the painful reality of quite how badly the at-home haircut went or the frown lines that we never noticed before video-calling became the norm \u2013 many of us will also be juggling children or others in the room while we are trying to concentrate.

      "bodyText": "Just before lockdown, 29-year-old Ala Uddin became ill with coronavirus-related symptoms and had to self-isolate in his London flat. \u201cFor 23 days I was relying on video calls,\u201d he says. \u201cI hardly used them before, but now it was the only way I could see anyone and communicate with my housemate, even though we were living in rooms next to each other.\u201d Uddin was also regularly video-calling his parents and siblings in York, as well as family members in Bangladesh, all of whom were checking in to make sure he was coping. \u201cWithout video calls I don\u2019t know how I could have got through that time,\u201d he says. Since the pandemic hit, Zoom, FaceTime, Houseparty, Microsoft Teams and all manner of other video-calling apps have become so engrained in our lives. As one of the only safe ways to communicate, it\u2019s hard to imagine living without them. None of these have taken off quite like Zoom. At the end of December, the app reported a maximum of 10 million daily users. By March, 200 million people were on it each day to work, socialise, view lessons and lectures, sing in choirs, attend church, birthday parties and weddings, meet new babies, say final words to dying family members and observe Ramadan and Easter. So embedded are these apps in all parts of life now that when Zoom went down last weekend, it made headlines around the world and even halted the Downing Street press conference. For many of us, Zoom, and apps like it, are a necessary frustration \u2013 the technical glitches, the pixellated faces, the exhaustingly long meetings with colleagues with their bookcases in the background \u2013 are the price we pay for preventing the spread of a pandemic. But for others, many of them elderly or disabled, the Zoom boom has helped them become more sociable than before. Julie Taylor, 61, who is retired and lives in Wiltshire, had never used video-calling before the lockdown began, but now talks to her friends every day via Zoom. \u201cMy neighbour Ben, who is 15, told me about it and helped me set it all up by calling instructions over the fence. It\u2019s made me realise what I was missing out on before,\u201d she says. \u201cI live on my own and so calling my friends each day or calling into the weekly public council meetings has been doing a lot of good for me when I feel down in the dumps.\u201d Similarly, Uddin\u2019s grandmother in York has been lent a tablet with video-calling software. \u201cIt was so emotional seeing her once she got it working,\u201d he says. \u201cSince she hasn\u2019t been able to go out at all, I could see how comforted she was just by having my face there and knowing that we\u2019re all safe.\u201d When Emma Critchley-Lloyd, 31, a marketer living in London, started a Saturday night Zoom quiz with her family, she didn\u2019t realise it would bring them into contact more regularly than before. \u201cA lot of my relatives aren\u2019t very good with technology and I\u2019ve never even needed to have their email addresses before,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing each other more than we would before lockdown and I hope we can keep it going afterwards \u2026 It\u2019s been something to look forward to each week, even though it can be an effort to get on a video call after a day of work Zooms.\u201d The psychologist Dr Doreen Dodgen-Magee sees video-calling as being an essential but contentious part of our lives. \u201cAs social animals, we fail to thrive when we can\u2019t have meaningful connections with others, so video-calling is really important at the moment for helping us feel part of a community,\u201d she says. But it is not without its flaws. \u201cSpeaking over video is such a static way of connecting with people. We\u2019re used to a full sensory experience, which is lost when we\u2019re limited to a small square of someone\u2019s face with audio delays. Plus, we\u2019re always seeing our own faces, so there\u2019s a constant sense of internal judgment on how we look and the distraction of where we should even be looking.\u201d Aside from the oddness of seeing our own faces in conversation \u2013 the painful reality of quite how badly the at-home haircut went or the frown lines that we never noticed before video-calling became the norm \u2013 many of us will also be juggling children or others in the room while we are trying to concentrate. It is a lot for our brains to contend with, so it\u2019s no wonder so many of us are experiencing Zoom fatigue. Tom, who is based in New York and works for a media company, has found himself on marathon seven- or eight-hour Zoom calls since lockdown began in the city. \u201cMy boss just has the video feed on all day and will fire instructions at us while he works so he doesn\u2019t have to call or email,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so inefficient because we end up not being able to do all of the other work we need to and these calls are so much more tiring than normal conversation. By the end of the day my brain feels like it\u2019s been pulverised and the smallest task becomes a huge effort.\u201d In the absence of benign office chat about our weekends and what we had for dinner last night, which helps to de-stress us in work environments, all our work interactions are now \u201chyper-focused\u201d, says Pam Custers, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory. \u201cFor that reason, breaks are more important than ever, since we\u2019re doing all our work and socialising in one place.\u201d One of the reasons that work Zoom calls can feel so draining is the pressure to fill any gaps in conversation. \u201cSilence feels very unnatural on a video call,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we need to allow that thinking time, as well as having the host be mindful of when to draw things to a close, rather than letting them peter out \u2026 At the moment there is a notion that you\u2019re available all the time because people aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d The 40-minute limit on free Zoom accounts could be the ideal amount of time to use, she suggests.

The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,120 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t count on\u2019 vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>A top US scientist has said governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine</a> being developed any time soon, urging people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. William Haseltine, the groundbreaking cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects researcher, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk case by any means ... because every time people have tried to make a vaccine \u2013 for Sars or Mers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t actually protected.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Migrant boat crossings to UK surge during virus lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks.

The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities.</p> <h2><strong>World sees largest daily rise in cases</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">the most in a single day so far</a>.

That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p> <h2><strong>Japan to lift state of emergency in Osaka and two other prefectures</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighbouring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo. The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.</p> <h2><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK.

The annual event marking the 1989 brutal crackdown by the Chinese army on protesters is traditionally the largest and only authorised commemoration of the massacre anywhere in China. However on Tuesday Hong Kong authorities extended until 4 June physical distancing laws limiting public gatherings to eight people, while relaxing other restrictions. Hong Kong police have cited the extension in refusing permission for a march on 4 June, and organisers expect refusal for the evening vigil. Lee Cheuk-Yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said the decision to extend the limits was \u201cclearly a political one\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cWhen you allow schools to reopen on May 27, when you allow religious gatherings to resume, when you allow even swimming pools to open and business activity will soon all reopen, but then you just ban gatherings? \u201cThe [virus] awareness in Hong Kong is very high and people will have respect for social distancing requirements and wear masks. There is no risk.\u201d With the usual vigil in Victoria Park \u2013 an area roughly the size of six football fields \u2013 likely to be banned, Lee said \u201cplan B\u201d was to ask residents to light candles across the city and for supporters across the world to light candles and observe a minute\u2019s silence at 8.09pm. \u201cI think this is more powerful.\u201d Authorities have been accused of using pandemic laws to break up protests and target demonstrators and press. The pro-democracy protest movement, which held mass protests across the city for most of last year, is showing signs of a resurgence as the threat of Covid-19 eases. The government denies the extension is to stop political gatherings. Lee, a veteran activist, has been a vocal figure of the pro-democracy movement. He has been arrested twice this year including in a recent round up of 15 high-profile individuals that was condemned by human rights and legal groups. They are facing charges of organising and participating in several unauthorised assemblies in 2019, with some members including Lee facing extra charges of inciting others to \u201cknowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly\u201d. In an address to the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club on Wednesday, Britain\u2019s last governor of the territory, Chris Patten, urged its people not to give in to growing pressure from Beijing and to continue marches on other significant dates, while avoiding violence. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that people go on standing up for what they believe in and voting for what they believe in,\u201d Patten said. The revival of the protest movement, and vocal support for it from world figures including US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, has drawn anger from Beijing. The US recently announced its report on Hong Kong\u2019s democracy, required under legislation passed last year, would be delayed until after this week\u2019s \u201ctwo sessions\u201d meetings of the Chinese Communist party leadership, in anticipation of what the party \u201cmight be contemplating\u201d. On Wednesday, Pompeo said the recent treatment of pro-democracy activists made it harder to assess Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China, a requirement for the city\u2019s special treatment under US law. In response, China\u2019s foreign ministry accused him of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the Hong Kong government, and said recent actions by the US amounted to blatant interference in China\u2019s internal affairs. On Wednesday it warned China would take \u201cnecessary countermeasures\u201d against the US after Pompeo gave unprecedented congratulations to Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, for her second inauguration. Ing-wen used her speech to pledge Taiwan would resist Chinese attempts at reunification.",

We found ourselves sans driver in a huge, 1960s American saloon atop a car lift on a beautiful August morning. At the window appeared a hand lofting a tray of four coffees (Turki, <em>masboot</em> of course) and glasses of water. We drank, passed around cigarettes and enjoyed the interlude. After a while the car lift descended and we continued on our journey. Lovely things happen in Lebanon; they always will.

We sat on the terrace with her family, communication very difficult. Eventually her daughter came and explained: the National Health Service had saved her father\u2019s life when he was in England. This was a way of saying thank you. Lindy Where it Leeds\u2026 We were on a cruise from Sydney to Hong Kong and got chatting to ex-footballer Duncan McKenzie as we walked around the deck. He was doing on-board talks, and although we knew nothing about the beautiful game, he was absolutely fascinating. It was surreal bumping into him all over the place, and wandering around blossom-swept Glover Garden, Nagasaki with him while his wife hit the shops. He was such a nice guy and made our trip. Lianna and Richard I\u2019m all right, Jacques Stopping for the night at a little two-star hotel in Avallon, central eastern France called Moulin des Templiers, we were absolutely amazed by the food, which was easily worth two Michelin stars. Turns out the owner used to be the chef at the Palace of Versailles when Jacques Chirac was president of France. We stayed for several days, just for the food \u2013 any longer would have been a health hazard, for if you left any on the plate the chef would come to the table and solemnly declare \u201cJe suis desol\u00e9\u201d and offer to cook something else. Unfortunately, on our last trip we discovered the chef had retired and sold the restaurant ... je suis desol\u00e9. Johannes Laying down the law In Marrakech, we were looking for the tombs of Moroccan kings. I asked one tourist and my wife asked another, who shoo-shooed her away. Having found the tombs, the tourist who had shoo-shooed my wife came up to apologise for his behaviour. He said he had been plagued by people all day and was sorry. I thought I recognised his very distinctive voice. I asked whether he was a lawyer but did not practise. He asked how did I know? I then asked him whether he lived in another country, and named it. He took a step back and demanded to know who I was. I said, \u201cI think I am your lawyer.\u201d He thought for a few seconds and then said my name. We had actually never met before. KAM Follow the piper On my second trip abroad, the first on my own, I went down to the Camargue in the south of France and stayed in a youth hostel. An older American man was staying there with his young children, showing them the wilder side of France while his wife remained in Cannes. He turned out to have been the flautist in the Nelson Riddle orchestra, and he had his flute with him. A fine evening was spent recalling famous singers, including Sinatra, and a flow of musical standards while we drank local ros\u00e9. The sound of hands clapping in applause, and catching mosquitos, remains in my mind. Jon, Somerset Weatherbeaten wisdom In the blue waters of Batteaux Bay, Tobago, a yacht was moored, from where a silver-haired guy climbed into a small dinghy and sculled ashore. He walked straight up to us in the beach bar and asked if he could join us. Sure, and we drank beer and ate flying-fish burgers. His name was Hal. He had sold up everything, bought a yacht and sailed the Caribbean for six months, and lived in a cabin in his son\u2019s garden the rest of the year. I loved to listen to this weatherbeaten 70-year-old. He said for a happy life you need three things: health, curiosity and to understand the concept of \u201cenough\u201d. I have followed this mantra all my life. Simon Tobin Pitstop in Beirut Souk el Gharb to Aley, the Chouf mountains, in pre-civil war Lebanon \u2013 1971-ish. I took a shared taxi to Beirut. After a kilometre or so the driver said we needed to stop in a garage while some work was needed underneath the car. We found ourselves sans driver in a huge, 1960s American saloon atop a car lift on a beautiful August morning. At the window appeared a hand lofting a tray of four coffees (Turki, masboot of course) and glasses of water. We drank, passed around cigarettes and enjoyed the interlude. After a while the car lift descended and we continued on our journey. Lovely things happen in Lebanon; they always will. The price is an open mind.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Minister reproached over \u2018wrong\u2019 science slur</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 it\u2019s Thursday and I\u2019m Warren Murray, here to help you track and trace the big stories.</p> \n<p>A top US scientist has said governments should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine being developed anytime soon, as global infections were set to pass five million after surges in Latin American countries including Brazil. The cancer, HIV/Aids and human genome projects researcher William Haseltine has said the best approach to the pandemic is to manage the disease through careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures whenever it starts spreading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">While a vaccine could be developed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it\u201d</a>, and people should wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. He said the United States and other countries had not done enough to \u201cforcibly isolate\u201d people exposed to the virus, but praised China, South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s efforts to curb infections.</p> \n<p>Surgical or everyday face masks can produce \u201cleakage jets\u201d that have the potential to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/face-mask-rules-more-political-than-scientific-says-expert\">propel virus particles several metres when the wearers exhale</a>, researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found. All face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90% but unless tightly worn they could send jets downwards and backwards. At present the UK government recommends the public wear face coverings in crowded places where social distancing is not feasible.</p> \n<p>Scientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-scientists-must-not-be-blamed-coronavirus-advice-says-royal-society-head\">appeared to blame \u201cwrong\u201d science</a> for mistakes in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government has disowned the remarks by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary.</p> \n<p>Ministers responding to the pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered departments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/ministers-overruled-permanent-secretaries-11-times-pandemic\">override formal objections from their most senior civil servant</a>, the permanent secretary, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports. Permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were made quickly and without full \u201cvalue for money\u201d checks, the NAO said. Because of the urgency, secretaries of state forced the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable. There are thought to have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years.</p> \n<p>Stay alert to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/21/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-near-5m-as-eu-health-chief-warns-of-second-wave\">global live blog</a> as your day proceeds \u2013 here is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/coronavirus-latest-21-may-at-a-glance\">quick flick through overnight developments</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Chronic threat\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Preparing for a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm emergency response teams already burnt out from dealing with Covid-19, a leaked Whitehall report warns. Its authors say the government\u2019s refusal to seek an extension to Brexit negotiations beyond 31 December threatens to \u201ccompound Covid-19 with a second UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/no-deal-brexit-would-overwhelm-local-emergency-teams\">societal-wide, economic and social, chronic threat</a>\u201d. The 76-page report marked \u201cofficial/sensitive\u201d was drawn up by the C-19 Foresight group, a cross-government team supporting the 42 local resilience forums (LRFs) in England and Wales that are tasked with planning and responding to major incidents and catastrophes.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Capital gains pour in for richest \u2013 </strong>The highest paid 1% in Britain received nearly 17% of all the country\u2019s income ahead of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a study that takes into account the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/21/top-1-of-british-earners-get-17-of-nations-income\">concentration of taxable capital gains among the better off</a>. It is a growing and much bigger slice of the national income than previously thought. In 2017-18 there were \u00a355bn of taxable capital gains recorded, with \u00a334bn of that divided between 9,000 individuals. The report questions whether capital gains should still be taxed at a much lower rate than other income, given they mainly flow to the rich, while the government faces a pressing need for raise revenue. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe must have a fairer settlement after this crisis \u2013 with those with the broadest shoulders making more of a contribution.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cohen on furlough \u2013 </strong>Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/michael-cohen-to-be-released-from-prison-and-serve-sentence-at-home\">released from federal prison today</a> on furlough (not that kind) to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. Cohen was sent to jail last May after pleading guilty to numerous charges including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. Separately the US supreme court has temporarily blocked the House of Representatives from obtaining secret grand jury testimony from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/us-supreme-court-mueller-investigation-trump-russia\">Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation</a>. The Trump administration is battling to put off the release of any materials until after election day on 3 November.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>A combination of good weather, treacherous surf, an absence of lifeguards and the easing of travel restrictions in England is causing the RNLI and coastguard deep concern leading up to the bank holiday weekend. With beaches unpatrolled because of coronavirus, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/uk-beach-safety-campaign-aims-to-avert-bank-holiday-deaths\">urging parents to protect their families</a> \u2013 while chaotic scenes involving day-tripper traffic have prompted police to warn road users to drive safely and park legally.</p> \n<p>Video calls have become part of daily life since the pandemic hit, helping the locked-down, especially elderly and disabled people, keep in touch. But there are downsides, writes Ammar Kalia \u2013 like the self-judgment that comes with constantly seeing your own face, or a boss who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/the-zoom-boom-how-video-calling-became-a-blessing-and-a-curse\">keeps the webcam running all day to fire work instructions at staff</a>. Animal calls, though, are booming \u2013 a goat can earn \u00a35 for a 10-minute appearance, and there\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/animal-zoom-calls-coronavirus-lockdown\">alpaca option too</a>, with bronze, silver or gold packages on offer. Just don\u2019t get fleeced \u2026</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: The fraught return to school</h2> \n<p>Oliver de Botton is a headteacher of a large state school in Newham, east London.

The finance ministry says imports fell 7%. The drop in exports is the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, as Japan struggles through a technical recession, juggling the health risks of Covid-19 with the need to keep the economy going. Some good news, though, with the government poised to lift a state of emergency in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo while keeping it in place in Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures as well as Hokkaido.</p> \n<p>Asian stock markets have been mixed overall, with investors looking ahead to Friday\u2019s meeting of China\u2019s legislature for details of possible new stimulus measures. Benchmarks in Shanghai and Seoul have risen, while Tokyo retreated. Hong Kong and Australia were little changed. The pound is worth $1.21 and \u20ac1.112 while the FTSE is trending lower before the open.</p> \n<h2>The papers</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s beginning to look a lot unlike lockdown \u2013 sorry that\u2019s not a Sun headline but the Briefing\u2019s own summation of front-page pictures today showing people flocking to beaches in the sun.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Minister reproached over \u2018wrong\u2019 science slur Good morning \u2013 it\u2019s Thursday and I\u2019m Warren Murray, here to help you track and trace the big stories. A top US scientist has said governments should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine being developed anytime soon, as global infections were set to pass five million after surges in Latin American countries including Brazil. The cancer, HIV/Aids and human genome projects researcher William Haseltine has said the best approach to the pandemic is to manage the disease through careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures whenever it starts spreading. While a vaccine could be developed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it\u201d, and people should wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. He said the United States and other countries had not done enough to \u201cforcibly isolate\u201d people exposed to the virus, but praised China, South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s efforts to curb infections. Surgical or everyday face masks can produce \u201cleakage jets\u201d that have the potential to propel virus particles several metres when the wearers exhale, researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found. All face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90% but unless tightly worn they could send jets downwards and backwards. At present the UK government recommends the public wear face coverings in crowded places where social distancing is not feasible. Scientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister appeared to blame \u201cwrong\u201d science for mistakes in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government has disowned the remarks by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary. Ministers responding to the pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, the permanent secretary, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports. Permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were made quickly and without full \u201cvalue for money\u201d checks, the NAO said. Because of the urgency, secretaries of state forced the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable. There are thought to have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years. Stay alert to our global live blog as your day proceeds \u2013 here is a quick flick through overnight developments. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * \u2018Chronic threat\u2019 \u2013 Preparing for a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm emergency response teams already burnt out from dealing with Covid-19, a leaked Whitehall report warns. Its authors say the government\u2019s refusal to seek an extension to Brexit negotiations beyond 31 December threatens to \u201ccompound Covid-19 with a second UK societal-wide, economic and social, chronic threat\u201d. The 76-page report marked \u201cofficial/sensitive\u201d was drawn up by the C-19 Foresight group, a cross-government team supporting the 42 local resilience forums (LRFs) in England and Wales that are tasked with planning and responding to major incidents and catastrophes. * * * Capital gains pour in for richest \u2013 The highest paid 1% in Britain received nearly 17% of all the country\u2019s income ahead of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a study that takes into account the concentration of taxable capital gains among the better off. It is a growing and much bigger slice of the national income than previously thought. In 2017-18 there were \u00a355bn of taxable capital gains recorded, with \u00a334bn of that divided between 9,000 individuals. The report questions whether capital gains should still be taxed at a much lower rate than other income, given they mainly flow to the rich, while the government faces a pressing need for raise revenue. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe must have a fairer settlement after this crisis \u2013 with those with the broadest shoulders making more of a contribution.\u201d * * * Cohen on furlough \u2013 Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, is expected to be released from federal prison today on furlough (not that kind) to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. Cohen was sent to jail last May after pleading guilty to numerous charges including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. Separately the US supreme court has temporarily blocked the House of Representatives from obtaining secret grand jury testimony from Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. The Trump administration is battling to put off the release of any materials until after election day on 3 November. Coronavirus Extra A combination of good weather, treacherous surf, an absence of lifeguards and the easing of travel restrictions in England is causing the RNLI and coastguard deep concern leading up to the bank holiday weekend. With beaches unpatrolled because of coronavirus, they are urging parents to protect their families \u2013 while chaotic scenes involving day-tripper traffic have prompted police to warn road users to drive safely and park legally. Video calls have become part of daily life since the pandemic hit, helping the locked-down, especially elderly and disabled people, keep in touch. But there are downsides, writes Ammar Kalia \u2013 like the self-judgment that comes with constantly seeing your own face, or a boss who keeps the webcam running all day to fire work instructions at staff. Animal calls, though, are booming \u2013 a goat can earn \u00a35 for a 10-minute appearance, and there\u2019s an alpaca option too, with bronze, silver or gold packages on offer. Just don\u2019t get fleeced \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: The fraught return to school Oliver de Botton is a headteacher of a large state school in Newham, east London. Like many teachers across the country, he is tackling the daunting task of getting ready for the return of some of his students in early June. Sally Weale, the Guardian education correspondent, looks at the backlash against this drive to return some year groups to school. Lunchtime read: Beginning John Malkovich \u201cI had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u201d The actor lost four close family members in five years, and his life savings to Bernie Madoff \u2013 so why does he still think he is the luckiest man around? Sport Amar Virdi, Surrey\u2019s title-winning off-spinner, and the promising Sussex seamer Ollie Robinson are among the 18 bowlers who will begin individual training sessions from today in anticipation of England staging an international cricket summer. For the first time, Wimbledon\u2019s annual payments to the Lawn Tennis Association have scaled \u00a350m as the LTA announced a strong financial standing. Fans have been given encouragement that some Premier League matches will be televised free-to-air after \u201cproductive discussions\u201d between the government and English football authorities. Britain\u2019s first Paralympics gold medallist, Margaret Maughan, has died at the age of 91. An NFL player is suing United Airlines, claiming he was sexually harassed, assaulted, abused and violated by a female passenger on a February flight from Los Angeles to Newark and the airline failed to properly respond to complaints. And Los Angeles police say a body found on Venice Beach is that of Shad Gaspard, the former WWE wrestler who was caught in a rip tide while swimming with his son last weekend. Business Japan\u2019s exports plunged nearly 22% in April, the country\u2019s worst drop in more than a decade as the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand. The finance ministry says imports fell 7%. The drop in exports is the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, as Japan struggles through a technical recession, juggling the health risks of Covid-19 with the need to keep the economy going. Some good news, though, with the government poised to lift a state of emergency in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo while keeping it in place in Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures as well as Hokkaido. Asian stock markets have been mixed overall, with investors looking ahead to Friday\u2019s meeting of China\u2019s legislature for details of possible new stimulus measures. Benchmarks in Shanghai and Seoul have risen, while Tokyo retreated. Hong Kong and Australia were little changed. The pound is worth $1.21 and \u20ac1.112 while the FTSE is trending lower before the open. The papers It\u2019s beginning to look a lot unlike lockdown \u2013 sorry that\u2019s not a Sun headline but the Briefing\u2019s own summation of front-page pictures today showing people flocking to beaches in the sun. The i parlays the visuals into a theme for its lead story: \u201cSummer holiday plan for Britain\u201d \u2013 the Guardian reports that holiday homes, campsites and hotels might reopen from July if there is no second wave. \u201cNHS and care staff to be offered virus antibody test within days\u201d \u2013 the Guardian front page says ministers will make the announcement today. The Mirror will be watching closely, calling it a \u201cTrace against time\u201d with \u201cpressure piling on the government\u201d to deliver. The Telegraph and the Mail are neutral sounding: \u201cPM promises tracing by June to help open schools\u201d says the former; \u201cBoris plan to relax lockdown in 10 days\u201d the latter. The Times says hospital admissions have fallen \u201cto lowest level of crisis\u201d, which could be taken a couple of ways. \u201cBoE ponders using negative rates for the first time to spur recovery\u201d \u2013 imagine having to pay to lend money, which the FT says is in prospect. Our own duo of Inman and Elliott explain it here. \u201cShamed by this hospital cleaner\u201d \u2013 the Metro takes up the story of a Syrian refugee working on the Covid frontline. All of that may be going on, but the Sun has found its true villain: \u201cleftie Coogan\u201d, the Alan Partridge comic who, it says, has put staff of his \u201ccountry pile\u201d on the government furlough scheme. The headline: \u201cKnowing me, furloughing you \u2026 AHA!\u201d The Express does its bit for government messaging: \u201cWe must win obesity war for sake of the NHS\u201d with the health secretary promising to act after \u201cshocking figures showed a link to Covid-19 deaths\u201d.

While the experience has been life-changing for her, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown up new challenges for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">those living in protected accommodation</a>, as well as the staff who are risking the virus to keep the services running.</p> <p>Through interviews and diary extracts, Annie and two women in the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge in Surrey have provided the Guardian with unique insight into life there in the time of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI was concerned about coming to the refuge \u2013 anyone would be \u2013 but if you know that you\u2019re going to be able to get far, far away then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Annie said. \u201cSo you just have to go through all your fears and break them down a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/my-working-week-mother-arrives-refuge-covid-19-symptoms\">My working week: 'A mother arrives at our refuge with Covid-19 symptoms'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rebecca, who is pregnant and has children, found the first few weeks of lockdown hard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to come to terms with the news of a lockdown, the virus, being pregnant, and in a refuge with other families that I have no control over how they should keep up with hygiene,\u201d she wrote in her diary.</p> <p>\u201cSo many fears and questions linger in my mind. How will we share the toilets? We are told that [if] one of us gets sick they will use the toilet and the shower downstairs and that is where my room is.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca explains she and the other tenants agree to a cleaning rota to allow some social distancing. \u201cSharing the communal areas is becoming a sort of nightmare because you don\u2019t know if the people here have the virus or not,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI keep to my room as I consider myself a high risk. I am very anxious and worried when my kids go out to the back garden and interact with other children.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca is a migrant and has to apply for a destitution domestic violence concession, allowing her to claim public funds while applying to settle in the UK. She found the challenges of home-schooling in a new environment difficult.</p> <p>\u201cI now have to be a teacher to my kids and make sure they complete school work,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThey are feeling disappointed but at least the whole country is on lockdown, not just us. So it doesn\u2019t make us feel disadvantaged. I try as much as I can to assure them.\u201d</p> <p>Other children knock on the door in the refuge, which makes her anxious. She wants her children to feel at home but she is concerned about the virus. \u201cI live in fear of the unknown,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>The women may feel anxious about the virus in the refuge but the staff are working hard to ensure they are in a safe environment.</p> <p>Charlotte Kneer, the chief executive of the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge and a survivor of abuse, said: \u201cThe big worry is it\u2019s a communal living environment in the same way as nurseries; if one gets a bug it goes through the whole place. It\u2019s the same for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 11 women, 24 children, in a small space where they\u2019re sharing facilities. We\u2019re trying to make sure that every day there\u2019s enough cleaning stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if someone gets it, they\u2019re all going to get it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it, there\u2019s a bathroom only they and their children use. Only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around.\u201d</p> <p>Kneer\u2019s refuge can house up to 11 vulnerable women and 24 children at a time. It offers clean, furnished rooms with televisions and tea-making facilities, a communal living area and kitchen, and a large garden with playground equipment.</p> <p>One member of staff is on site every day to hand out rations of food and toiletries.</p> <p>Multiple support services have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\">a surge in calls to helplines</a> during the lockdown period but there are fears that the already creaking refuge system in England and Wales will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/refuges-from-domestic-violence-running-out-of-space-mps-hear\">not be able to cope with the number of women looking to flee abuse</a>.</p> <p>Sally, also a mother, said the lockdown had brought with it additional anxiety and frustration.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would like to add, that no matter the delay and any problems we get, this is the best place to be under the circumstances of domestic abuse. First of all me and my child, we are safe. We receive a lot of emotional and practical support here.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that I went through, and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me.</p> <p>\u201cThe assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasn\u2019t all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident. Being manipulated for 10 years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make.\u201d</p> <p>She had to take a Covid-19 test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature.</p> <p>While at the hospital, one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers \u2013 but social services recommended this was limited to the one night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult, he didn\u2019t want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI was very worried about the Covid-19 test \u2013 if it would be positive, maybe my child had it too, then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him, also my housemate who has asthma and her kids.\u201d</p> <p>She was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative \u2013 but because she had visited a hospital she had to self-isolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge, although her housemate offered to help.</p> <p>\u201cI was having difficult time accepting help. My ex-partner, that I spent 10 years with, he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSlowly he destroyed my self-esteem and my personality, I was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs.</p> <p>\u201cThis left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone. Now not being able to do my usual daily things was making me feel anxious and stressed a lot.\u201d</p> <p>She says that self-isolation compounds how isolated she feels having left her previous home.</p> <p>\u201cRefuge helped me a lot,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit was a life-saving decision to move here, but there always comes the feeling of isolation.</p> <p>\u201cHaving to go through lockdown and now self-isolation made it even worse, especially when you are sharing your home with another family, you don\u2019t really feel free at your own home, you don\u2019t even feel that you are at home.\u201d</p> <p>The shortage in spaces in refuges during lockdown has sparked initiatives to offer safe accommodation with specialist support, such as the Covid-19 Crisis Project run by Solace and Southall Black Sisters in London.</p> <p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared with 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England.</p> <p><em>Annie, Rebecca and Sally agreed to their names being changed for this piece to protect their identities</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Annie had endured two years of domestic abuse when the coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed. It was at this moment she finally started to believe her partner would kill her. \u201cYou can\u2019t go out with anyone, there\u2019s no way to get away from it \u2013 you\u2019re stuck with it 24 hours,\u201d she said. But the intensity of the lockdown prompted Annie to take a crucial step \u2013 she resolved to flee her home and seek shelter in a women\u2019s refuge. Annie was taken into one of 21 refuges run by the charity Hestia across 10 London boroughs. While the experience has been life-changing for her, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown up new challenges for those living in protected accommodation, as well as the staff who are risking the virus to keep the services running. Through interviews and diary extracts, Annie and two women in the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge in Surrey have provided the Guardian with unique insight into life there in the time of Covid-19. \u201cI was concerned about coming to the refuge \u2013 anyone would be \u2013 but if you know that you\u2019re going to be able to get far, far away then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Annie said. \u201cSo you just have to go through all your fears and break them down a little bit.\u201d Rebecca, who is pregnant and has children, found the first few weeks of lockdown hard. \u201cI\u2019m trying to come to terms with the news of a lockdown, the virus, being pregnant, and in a refuge with other families that I have no control over how they should keep up with hygiene,\u201d she wrote in her diary. \u201cSo many fears and questions linger in my mind. How will we share the toilets? We are told that [if] one of us gets sick they will use the toilet and the shower downstairs and that is where my room is.\u201d Rebecca explains she and the other tenants agree to a cleaning rota to allow some social distancing. \u201cSharing the communal areas is becoming a sort of nightmare because you don\u2019t know if the people here have the virus or not,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI keep to my room as I consider myself a high risk. I am very anxious and worried when my kids go out to the back garden and interact with other children.\u201d Rebecca is a migrant and has to apply for a destitution domestic violence concession, allowing her to claim public funds while applying to settle in the UK. She found the challenges of home-schooling in a new environment difficult. \u201cI now have to be a teacher to my kids and make sure they complete school work,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey are feeling disappointed but at least the whole country is on lockdown, not just us. So it doesn\u2019t make us feel disadvantaged. I try as much as I can to assure them.\u201d Other children knock on the door in the refuge, which makes her anxious. She wants her children to feel at home but she is concerned about the virus. \u201cI live in fear of the unknown,\u201d she wrote. The women may feel anxious about the virus in the refuge but the staff are working hard to ensure they are in a safe environment. Charlotte Kneer, the chief executive of the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge and a survivor of abuse, said: \u201cThe big worry is it\u2019s a communal living environment in the same way as nurseries; if one gets a bug it goes through the whole place. It\u2019s the same for us. \u201cWe have 11 women, 24 children, in a small space where they\u2019re sharing facilities. We\u2019re trying to make sure that every day there\u2019s enough cleaning stuff. \u201cI\u2019m worried that if someone gets it, they\u2019re all going to get it. \u201cWe have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it, there\u2019s a bathroom only they and their children use. Only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around.\u201d Kneer\u2019s refuge can house up to 11 vulnerable women and 24 children at a time. It offers clean, furnished rooms with televisions and tea-making facilities, a communal living area and kitchen, and a large garden with playground equipment. One member of staff is on site every day to hand out rations of food and toiletries. Multiple support services have seen a surge in calls to helplines during the lockdown period but there are fears that the already creaking refuge system in England and Wales will not be able to cope with the number of women looking to flee abuse. Sally, also a mother, said the lockdown had brought with it additional anxiety and frustration. \u201cBut I would like to add, that no matter the delay and any problems we get, this is the best place to be under the circumstances of domestic abuse. First of all me and my child, we are safe. We receive a lot of emotional and practical support here. \u201cIt was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that I went through, and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me. \u201cThe assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasn\u2019t all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident. Being manipulated for 10 years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make.\u201d She had to take a Covid-19 test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature. While at the hospital, one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers \u2013 but social services recommended this was limited to the one night. \u201cIt was difficult, he didn\u2019t want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was very worried about the Covid-19 test \u2013 if it would be positive, maybe my child had it too, then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him, also my housemate who has asthma and her kids.\u201d She was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative \u2013 but because she had visited a hospital she had to self-isolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge, although her housemate offered to help. \u201cI was having difficult time accepting help. My ex-partner, that I spent 10 years with, he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cSlowly he destroyed my self-esteem and my personality, I was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs. \u201cThis left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone. Now not being able to do my usual daily things was making me feel anxious and stressed a lot.\u201d She says that self-isolation compounds how isolated she feels having left her previous home. \u201cRefuge helped me a lot,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit was a life-saving decision to move here, but there always comes the feeling of isolation. \u201cHaving to go through lockdown and now self-isolation made it even worse, especially when you are sharing your home with another family, you don\u2019t really feel free at your own home, you don\u2019t even feel that you are at home.\u201d The shortage in spaces in refuges during lockdown has sparked initiatives to offer safe accommodation with specialist support, such as the Covid-19 Crisis Project run by Solace and Southall Black Sisters in London. There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared with 170 on the same day last year. The Women\u2019s Aid Annual Survey 2017, carried out on a single day, found there were 3,557 women with 3,919 children and young people staying in refuges across all services in England. Annie, Rebecca and Sally agreed to their names being changed for this piece to protect their identities",

      "bodyText": "The number of frontline charities and community groups seeking help to feed the hungry from the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution organisation has tripled since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. FareShare has added a further 500 charities to its waiting list, more than 80% of which are delivering emergency food parcels to vulnerable families and individuals at risk of hunger, its annual report said, as benefit claims and unemployment soar because of the virus. The FareShare network is made up of 17 independent food redistribution organisations. The report said they redistributed more than 24,000 tonnes of in-date surplus food from the food industry in the last financial year, a 26% increase on the previous 12 months and the equivalent of 1m meals a week. This was used by almost 11,000 charities \u2013 including domestic violence refuges, breakfast clubs, food banks and day centres. But in the month after lockdown was implement, the charity distributed 3,208 tonnes of food \u2013 double the usual amount \u2013 and enough to create almost 2m meals a week. In just one week in April, more people signed up to volunteer to sort, pack and deliver food for FareShare than in the whole of last year. To help store and manage the additional food, the charity has recently secured another nine warehouses\u2019 worth extra capacity. It is now urging the government to cover the costs to producers and growers of saving surplus food from waste and sending it to charities, in order to tackle an expected rise in food poverty during and after the crisis. Lindsay Boswell, the chief executive of FareShare, said: \u201cWhen the crisis ends, the need for our food will still be there. In April alone 856,500 more people claimed benefits and job opportunities fell by a quarter. Many more people will fall through the gaps in society and need the support of frontline charities.\u201d Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food, according to data from the Food Foundation. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe continue to support redistribution organisations getting food to those in need through our work with the Wrap Resource Action Fund.

      "body": "<p>NHS and social care staff will be given antibody tests revealing whether they have had coronavirus from next week, ministers are to announce on Thursday.</p> <p>In a move designed to reduce frontline workers\u2019 anxiety and provide data on how many people have had Covid-19, hundreds of thousands of workers will be offered access to the blood tests, which must be processed in laboratories.</p> <p>However, experts warned of the risk of creating a false sense of security for those with positive antibody test results, as they offer no guarantee of immunity. While it is hoped that the presence of antibodies reduces or removes the risk of reinfection, this has not yet been proved. The length of any immunity gained is also unknown.</p> <p>Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: \u201cThe ability to assess who has and has not already had this virus is a major milestone, but there are still a number of unknown factors.</p> <p>\u201cAs we learn more about the role of antibodies, this could open the door to different ways of working and reduce the level of risk to NHS staff by allocating those who have had the virus to care for Covid-19 patients.

      "bodyText": "NHS and social care staff will be given antibody tests revealing whether they have had coronavirus from next week, ministers are to announce on Thursday. In a move designed to reduce frontline workers\u2019 anxiety and provide data on how many people have had Covid-19, hundreds of thousands of workers will be offered access to the blood tests, which must be processed in laboratories. However, experts warned of the risk of creating a false sense of security for those with positive antibody test results, as they offer no guarantee of immunity. While it is hoped that the presence of antibodies reduces or removes the risk of reinfection, this has not yet been proved. The length of any immunity gained is also unknown. Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: \u201cThe ability to assess who has and has not already had this virus is a major milestone, but there are still a number of unknown factors. \u201cAs we learn more about the role of antibodies, this could open the door to different ways of working and reduce the level of risk to NHS staff by allocating those who have had the virus to care for Covid-19 patients. But we must be clear that huge uncertainties remain while we do not know the level and length of any immunity which antibodies will offer. \u201cThe new test\u2019s arrival should not simply be seen as a green light to reduce PPE and other protections for NHS staff who test positive.\u201d Either Boris Johnson or Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is expected to make the announcement on Thursday, the Guardian understands. Public Health England (PHE) validated two laboratory-based antibody tests from Swiss-based Roche and US-based Abbott last week, and another \u2013 from the Welsh firm Ortho Clinical Diagnostics \u2013 this week. Initially, priority will be given to frontline hospital personnel working most closely with Covid patients, such as intensive care staff, those working on coronavirus wards and doctors and nurses in A&amp;E units. Scientists will monitor those who test positive to see whether their antibody levels drop over time and whether any of them fall ill again. Despite the lack of guaranteed immunity, one source with knowledge of the plan expressed hope that the tests would instil confidence in NHS workers. \u201cThe intention is that NHS and care staff will get these tests in the first instance to see if they\u2019ve had the virus, so that they can feel able to go back to work safely, knowing that they will have at least some immunity,\u201d the source said. A senior figure in the NHS added: \u201cAntibody tests for staff could be a real game-changer in letting hospitals restart services. However, they won\u2019t be able to tell us for months if people who have had the virus are immune.\u201d Meanwhile, a private testing bonanza looks set to take off, with private GP clinics and the high street chemist Superdrug offering antibody tests supplied by Abbott for sale to the public. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics\u2019 newly PHE-approved test outperformed the other two. Ortho, based in Cardiff for 40 years, says its test is 100% specific for Covid-19, which means it does not confuse the antibodies produced in response to the virus with those from other coronaviruses, including the common cold. Roche\u2019s test has been validated by PHE as 99.8% specific and Abbott\u2019s as 99.6% specific. The Abbott tests sold by Superdrug for \u00a369 and private clinics such as Babylon and the Independent General Practice in Wales are \u201chome\u201d tests in that people can take a blood sample at home after buying the kit, but they must post it to a lab for processing. Rapid fingerprick tests that give an instant result, like a pregnancy test, have not yet proved accurate enough for approval. The accuracy of the Superdrug test is given on their website as 97.5% because people will have to lance their finger to obtain blood themselves rather than have a health professional do it, which adds the risk of error. Scientists emphasised warnings over the risks of antibody tests for the public. \u201cIf a person takes a test and gets a false positive, they may assume they have been exposed and that they have immunity when they do not,\u201d said Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol. \u201cSo the bottom line is: don\u2019t spend money and time on any test unless you have a very clear idea of what the result does or does not mean for you and what you are going to do or not do if you get a positive or negative result.\u201d Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the tests were \u201cgood for satisfying people\u2019s curiosity, but no more\u201d. \u201cHaving these antibodies is a reliable way of confirming that someone has been infected previously.

      "bodyText": "The wearing of cloth face masks by the public was becoming more about politics than science, one expert has argued, as a new study reveals potential benefits and problems of the coverings. At present the UK government recommends the public wear face coverings when in crowded places where it is not always possible to maintain social distancing \u2013 a stance also taken by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 while other countries, including the Czech Republic, have made the wearing of masks in the community mandatory. Now a new study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh has looked into the impact of different types of face mask on airflow ejected by a wearer when they breathed or coughed, including standard surgical masks, FFP2 respirators and cloth masks. The researchers found all face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90%. But they added that fit was essential, pointing out that \u201csurgical, handmade masks, and face shields, generate significant leakage jets that have the potential to disperse virus-laden fluid particles by several metres,\u201d and that such jets tend to be directed downwards or backwards. Dr Simon Kolstoe, senior lecturer in evidence-based healthcare and university ethics adviser at the University of Portsmouth, said when it comes to the science there \u201cisn\u2019t that much to argue about\u201d. He said the new study backs previous evidence that cloth masks were not as effective as FFP1 or FFP2 masks \u2013 equivalent to N95 masks \u2013 when it comes to preventing the transmission of viruses, but can direct the breath in different ways. But Kolstoe said there was limited evidence about how effective cloth masks were, or whether they have a big impact. The upshot was a debate that was more political than scientific. \u201cMy feeling is that this is becoming more of a statement, a statement of solidarity. By going out and wearing a face mask you show that you are taking action, you show other people you are concerned about this, you are concerned about them, you are concerned about yourself. But perhaps conversely by not wearing a face mask that is also a statement as well,\u201d said Kolstoe, pointing to a recent Politico article with the headline \u201cWearing a mask is for smug liberals.

Describing homemade face coverings, Kolstoe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it does any particular harm to wear, them I don\u2019t think it does any particular good to wear them \u2013 and as a consequence you are going to get people jumping on either side of the bandwagon.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after the imposition of lockdown, I came across a team of workers painting red lines all the way down Ridley Road. They started at dusk and had to work through the night to complete the task. I was intrigued by the addition to the street iconography and developed the idea of making portraits to include both masks and these new lines of separation. Most of the people I approached were keen to be photographed, feeling that they wanted to advocate mask wearing. They had widely different reasons for choosing to wear a mask. Some felt they were protecting others \u2013 some were fearful of contracting the virus themselves. Masks can signify many things today: anxiety, isolation, social responsibility, fear or safety. In our \u201cnew normal\u201d this material barrier has become a unifier, holding us together. Halima Salvador, catering assistant \u201cIt\u2019s been really hard as we can\u2019t see our families or socialise anymore.

We can\u2019t do the necessary appointments as the hospitals are telling us not to come in. So life has been pushed back. Going to do your grocery shopping takes all day, there are long queues. I hate wearing a mask. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe with it on but it is part of my identity now, and when I walk down the street my friends don\u2019t recognise me.

Covid-19 has shone a true light on what this government and its austerity measures have done. We, the disabled people are seen as scroungers living off the state and treated as second-class citizens. Thousands of lives have been lost due to what I believe is purposeful neglect. I came out shopping for food as my neighbours were not available. My friend lives 4 miles away.

I feel if people are wearing masks it\u2019s OK but there are so many people that are not wearing any sort of mask. They need to be cautious so this can end faster.\u201d Loriane \u2018Dempsey\u2019 Dunkley\u2013Clark, retired dress designer \u201cI\u2019m retired and I live alone, so it\u2019s not so easy. I love my home and I am fortunate to have a lovely space with a garden where I spend a lot of time. But I have noticed myself sometimes feeling depressed. I have to make sure I go out for a walk every day. It has made me more thoughtful and sometimes a bit unhappy. I have the radio on constantly and the news. I don\u2019t have a television, thank God. If I still had it I\u2019d probably just be staring at it all through the night.\u201d Marco Darmanin, cleaner at Ridley Villas hostel for the homeless \u201cI feel like I\u2019m managing to handle this situation but its still very sad. Work has been good. We have a lovely team and we take care of each other and the residents, it\u2019s all love and respect. That\u2019s what makes this situation easier, even though you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on with people dying. But we\u2019re all still going with a positive attitude. I wear a mask when I go outside, I find it a little harder to breathe but it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s different but once you get used to that\u2019s it. Humans are very adaptable.\u201d Julliet Makhapila, community educator and poet \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see that so many people are losing their lives through this pandemic. It makes you realise life is short. But it is also a good reminder that we are all connected to each other. We need to learn to share more in this world. The little things in life are the most beautiful of all: smiling every day and loving our neighbours. Covid-19 also reminds us that social inequality is very real. I am constantly worried about shops closing or not having any food. Today was my first time wearing a mask. I think if you have a good quality mask it tricks your mind into thinking you\u2019re going to be OK. I don\u2019t believe it really makes a difference and l think the biggest practice is having good hygiene. AI worry that masks could bring about more crime, because it conceals people\u2019s identities. But I understand we need to follow guidelines given by our government.\u201d Fatima Farif, student \u201cThis situation now is difficult, I miss being outside and exploring London. I\u2019m studying business and accounting and the course has moved online. It\u2019s not been too bad but I miss going to campus. I take wearing a mask outside very seriously because I have a condition called sickle cell anaemia, which means that I am part of the vulnerable group. Because of this I have been really worried about going outside. I go out only to buy food and nothing else.\u201d Hamed Ali, care worker \u201cI work in Dalston, Monday to Friday. It has been hard because there are fewer carers working. I feel very worried about going outside sometimes. I wear a mask because I feel that anxiety, I don\u2019t like it but I have no choice. I need to protect myself and others.\u201d Alessandro Merlo and Aldo Gianola, photographer and psychology student Merlo: \u201cThe start of this lockdown was very anxiety inducing, I couldn\u2019t do anything. Since then I\u2019ve been trying to spend my time creatively. It\u2019s put everything to a halt with Aldo too. He\u2019s been studying and doing his exams from home. We\u2019re Italian so we were concerned early on about the virus as we have family in Italy. I am someone who likes to dress up and wear clothing as a form of expression. I resisted wearing a mask but reading articles and speaking to Asian friends made me realise it was ridiculous to not wear a mask because it stops the spread. I also think it signals to others that you\u2019re looking after them\u201d Manny Wongkaew, creative director, stylist and lecturer at University of the Arts London \u201cI was always out and come home just to sleep. Now I am home all the time and it has opened me up to my local community. I have been walking on the canal as my daily exercise.Life is much simpler. I\u2019m a creative director/stylist and I teach. The classroom is now online. This can be an exciting opportunity for engaging and sharing ideas, but it is also hard. When the lockdown happened I was in the middle of house moving, but my landlord said I could stay on. I support wearing masks to protect myself and protect people in our community.\u201d This work was originally commissioned by Cortona on the Move, international festival of visual narrative in partnership with Intesa Sanpaolo, for The Covid-19 Visual Project.

Kennedy\u2019s comments to the Covid-19 Senate committee on Thursday are a strong signal that the government should use fiscal policy to boost the economy rather than attempt cuts to improve the budget position. Thursday\u2019s hearing began with a sobering review of April\u2019s labour force statistics showing a loss of 600,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.2%. Kennedy said that \u201croughly speaking\u201d the figures were in line with Treasury\u2019s estimates of 10% unemployment, noting that if the 489,000 people who stopped looking for work due to Covid-19 restrictions were counted, the figure would have been 9.6%.

So far so good, I would say.\u201d Kennedy told the committee he was \u201cnot particularly concerned about the level of debt Australia is left with\u201d at the end of the pandemic. He said debt would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d, but given the economic shock it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to respond in the way the government had, with $194bn of fiscal stimulus, including the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy.

The committee chair and shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has called for an investigation into government debt. The Greens want the government to borrow more to fund the recovery. Kennedy said the \u201cdemand confidence\u201d of businesses and households would be the key issue that determined whether Australia experienced a V- or U-shaped recovery, but it was \u201cvery hard to determine\u201d whether consumers would flock back to shops and cafes now restrictions were easing. Kennedy said he was not necessarily predicting a V-shaped recovery but \u201cif the government responds well with its fiscal levers\u201d Australia needn\u2019t experience an L-shape, associated with sustained depression. Treasury officials revealed 900,000 businesses covering more than 6 million employees were enrolled for jobkeeper wage subsidies, and 1.65 million had applied for early access to $13.2bn worth of superannuation. Labor seized on the figures to argue that workers accessing their retirement savings was the largest single component of economic support. Kennedy said the Treasury review of jobkeeper would consider whether some industries needed the payment for longer, and the \u201ctaper rates\u201d and incentives, in terms of how the wage subsidy interacts with the jobseeker unemployment benefit. But he warned that both jobkeeper and the corona supplement on jobseeker were \u201cdesigned to be temporary schemes, and I think rightly so\u201d. Officials from the Fair Work Commission told the committee it had received the biggest spike in unfair dismissal claims in its history.

The commission\u2019s general manager, Bernadette O\u2019Neill, revealed it had received 323 disputes related to the jobkeeper program, with directions standing workers down, requests to change hours of work and to take annual leave the biggest causes of dispute. On Thursday the attorney general, Christian Porter, announced an urgent process of consultation to respond to the federal court\u2019s Rossato decision \u2013 that employees described as casuals could be owed further entitlements if they performed regular, permanent work. Porter confirmed that if the labour hire firm WorkPac appealed against the decision, the federal government would intervene on its side, and did not rule out legislation to overturn its effect. Porter flagged one possible solution would be to give \u201cgreater clarity and universality\u201d to the right of casuals to request their employment be converted to permanent work.",

The Knights of Malta originated in a chivalric order in the 11th century to care for Christians making the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. As shelters for travellers were known as hospitals, the knights became known as the Knights Hospitallers.

The department of engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh is named after him. Image: An Alchemist in His Laboratory, 19th century, James Nasmyth (1808-90), Wellcome Collection, 4:C - According to tradition, Parvati carved a boy from earth and as her husband Shiva was away, her new son stood guard while she bathed. When Shiva returned, the boy denied him entry. Shiva decapitated Ganesha in anger but when Parvati learned of this, she was so enraged she decided to destroy Ganesha. Shiva repented, found a new head for the boy from an elephant and restored their son to life.

The same year, Vesalius presented his book to the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, who appointed him as regular court physician and granted him lifelong pension and the aristocratic title of Count Palatine. Vesalius also gave Charles V a special vellum copy of the work and dedicated The Epitome to his son Prince Philip II.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s nascent trade war with China is threatening to spill over to its most valuable export \u2013 iron ore \u2013 with China\u2019s customs officials imposing new inspection procedures and rules from next month, which could be used to block or hold up Australian shipments. But miners and Australia\u2019s trade minister say the changed inspection regime could actually streamline Australian ore imports. China\u2019s customs authorities issued a notice over the new supervising rules, to take effect from 1 June, which will oblige customs officials to inspect iron ore at the request of the trader or importer. This replaces the previous system where customs officers conducted mandatory on-site inspections of iron ore batch by batch. The notice said \u201cwhen necessary\u201d customs could conduct toxic element checks, and that the changes were designed to \u201cstreamline\u201d procedures to \u201cbuild a better business environment\u201d. But the Chinese Communist party-run Global Times newspaper warned that Australian iron ore imports could be damaged by worsening political tensions between Canberra and Beijing. \u201cThis is another implicit warning to Australia,\u201d Yu Lei, a chief research fellow at the Research Center for Pacific Island Countries at Liaocheng University, told the paper. \u201cIt is associated with how Australia has acted, and a general decline in demand for steel on the global level.\u201d China is the largest consumer of iron ore in the world.

Production in China\u2019s second largest supplier, Brazil, has plunged by a quarter because of the country\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak. Depending on how inspections are applied, the new customs regime might actually smooth the entry of Australian iron ore into China. \u201cEarly indications talking to the industry are \u2026 that this would provide an opportunity for benefits both to China and to Australia,\u201d trade minister Simon Birmingham said Thursday. \u201cWe welcome any improvements in administrative arrangements that could streamline the customs clearance of iron ore imports.\u201d The chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, Tania Constable, said Australian iron ore was vital to China\u2019s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, and that the streamlining of ore testing \u201crecognises the high quality of Australia\u2019s iron ore\u201d. BHP said in a statement it welcomed the Chinese customs changes, saying the changes had been flagged previously. \u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the changes to the iron ore inspection process and believe it will create a more efficient supply chain for producers like us as well as our Chinese customers. \u201cChina Customs has been keeping us informed of their intention to change some of the iron ore inspection process for quite some time.\u201d Other miners, including Fortescue, also welcomed the new regulations. China\u2019s customs move follows an 80% tariff imposed on Australia barley over allegations of anti-dumping law breaches and the banning of beef imports from four abattoirs over technical and labelling infringements. Reports from China suggest Beijing has drawn up a \u201chit list\u201d of further Australian products \u2013 including wine, dairy, seafood, oatmeal and fruit \u2013 that could be subjected to stricter quality control checks, increased tariffs, customs delays or state media-encouraged consumer boycotts. The Global Times urged Australia to \u201crelease more goodwill and take more measures to repair its relationship\u201d with its largest trading partner. \u201cChina has the power to hurt the Aussie economy but won\u2019t fire the first shot in a trade war,\u201d it said. \u201cIn view of past experience, China won\u2019t be the one to take the first provocative step, but it should be noted that any further attempt to confuse malicious Covid-19 inquiries with trade would only exacerbate the tensions, driving bilateral trade off track.\u201d Australia\u2019s forthright pursuit of an independent international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 have driven yet another wedge between Beijing and Canberra, fracturing further a relationship scarred by long-running antagonisms over foreign interference, the exclusion of Huawei from Australia\u2019s 5G network, China\u2019s incarceration of the Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; and Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea. The World Health Assembly this week agreed to an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control globally. The proposal was drafted by the EU but ultimately co-sponsored by both Australia and China. And both claimed the result as vindication of their positions, with the dispute descending further into petty barbs. Australia\u2019s original proposal, floated last month, argued for \u201cweapons inspector\u201d-style powers for investigators, and that the review be conducted externally to the World Health Organization. These conditions weren\u2019t met: the shape, scope and powers of the review have not been decided. A Chinese embassy spokesperson said Australia\u2019s claims to justification were \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d, prompting the Australian trade minister, Simon Birmingham, to rebuke the diplomatic mission for making \u201ccheap\u201d, \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. The US, in a presidential election year and whose leadership has led a public excoriation of China for its handling of the pandemic, has swung firmly behind Australia. \u201cThe Chinese Communist party chose to threaten Australia with economic retribution for the simple act of asking for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus,\u201d the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said at a media briefing in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s not right \u2026 we stand with Australia.\u201d Pompeo, a longstanding hawk on China, said the country had \u201cbeen ruled by a brutal, authoritarian regime\u201d since 1949. \u201cWe greatly underestimated the degree to which Beijing is ideologically and politically hostile to free nations,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe whole world is waking up to that fact.\u201d The US ambassador to Australia, Arthur Culvahouse Jr, said on Wednesday the US \u201ccommend[s] Australia\u2019s leadership in achieving a much-needed investigation into COVID-19 origins to keep people safe and defeat the pandemic\u201d. \u201cWhen Australia speaks, the world listens!\u201d On Thursday Australia\u2019s home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the country was right to stand up to China. \u201cThe values of the communist regime are not compatible with ours so you will have tensions from time to time,\u201d he told 2GB radio, adding: \u201cbut we aren\u2019t going to compromise on our values and our beliefs.\u201d Labor\u2019s agriculture and resources spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Australia needed to be \u201crobust in defence of our national interest\u201d but said he did not believe China was bullying Australia through economic coercion. \u201cFor the last few years \u2026 we\u2019ve been demonising the Chinese and their system of governance,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is facing calls to save a busy Centrelink office after it told the public sector union it would postpone controversial plans to shut the centre in inner Melbourne. The decision to postpone the closure, one day after Services Australia announced suddenly that the office would shut for good from Friday, came after a bitter war of words erupted between the agency responsible for Centrelink and a major property company over the site. The Abbotsford service centre, which is surrounded by some of Melbourne\u2019s largest public housing estates, was set to close on Friday, but may now be saved after the landlord indicated its desire to continue the lease and Services Australia said it would await an offer. Services Australia officials informed the Community and Public Sector Union on Thursday the lease would be extended for three months and the closure would be postponed. Alistair Waters, the union\u2019s national president, said: \u201cThe CPSU is shocked and disappointed by Services Australia\u2019s decision to close the Abbotsford site. \u201cWhile we welcome the delay, the need for face to face services isn\u2019t going to magically disappear in three months.\u201d The development came only after the Guardian reported comments from the landlord, Salta Properties, which claimed it had learned of the closure of the Centrelink office on Friday through Twitter \u2013 and that it had offered to continue the lease on existing terms. In a statement on Thursday hitting back at Salta\u2019s claims, Services Australia said the offer to renew the lease had come via text message on Thursday, a day after the closure was announced. \u201cThe landlord of the Yarra Service Centre in Abbotsford, advised Services Australia through its legal representative on 12 May 2020 that it will not agree to any lease extension beyond 22 May 2020,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe current legal position stands as the landlord\u2019s notice to vacate instructs Services Australia to vacate the premises by 22 May 2020. \u201cToday, 21 May 2020, Services Australia received an offer via text message to allow an extension to the lease for three months. We await a written legal offer. \u201cServices Australia will announce any changes to the services in due course.\u201d On Wednesday, the government services minister, Stuart Robert told the local MP and Greens leader, Adam Bandt by letter that the landlord had advised the agency they would \u201cnot retain Services Australia as a short-term or long-term tenant and will not permit any occupancy by the Agency at the premises after the lease expires\u201d. Robert said: \u201cLet there be no misunderstanding \u2013 despite the Agency actively engaging with the landlord over an extended period, a lease agreement has not been reached.\u201d He claimed the landlord was \u201calso unwilling to permit a lease holdover arrangement to allow further lease renewal negotiations, or to locate a suitable alternative premises\u201d. On Thursday, the landlord, Salta Properties, which is led by billionaire developer Sam Tarascio, flatly denied the claims, saying it was completely blindsided by the news. A spokesman told the Guardian it had offered the agency a \u201clease extension on existing terms and was awaiting a formal reply\u201d. \u201cSalta Properties was shocked to learn late yesterday on Twitter of Centrelink\u2019s decision to vacate the premises,\u201d he said. \u201cThis morning it reached out again to Centrelink to confirm the premises remain available and it is welcome to stay.

On Wednesday Services Australia said it would close the Abbotsford service centre from the end of Thursday, and would be directing people to the South Melbourne office more than 6km away and on the other side of the city. It has been the scene of some of the largest dole queues during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Bandt. Robert was under pressure on Thursday to explain the confusion over the future of the centre. Bandt demanded a written explanation and warned of a potential censure motion, while Labor\u2019s government services spokesman Bill Shorten claimed the minister needed to \u201cstop hiding behind fanciful stories\u201d. \u201cThe minister must immediately reach out to the landlord and ensure Abbotsford Centrelink remains where it is,\u201d Bandt said. Shorten accused the government of a \u201creckless plan\u201d to close down Centrelink shopfronts, claiming that service centres at Mornington and Newport, Newcastle and Tweed Heads were also on the chopping block. City of Yarra councillor Stephen Jolly said on Thursday the council would pass a motion offering a council building in the nearby suburb of Richmond for a long-term lease as a Centrelink office, including one year\u2019s free rent. Robert has been contacted for comment.",

It is thought it could prevent companies with offshore links from applying to a new \u00a3120m enterprise resilience fund that provides grants for small- and medium-sized firms, and a \u00a330m creative, tourism and hospitality bailout fund for firms that cannot get business rates relief. The measures, which were also backed by the Conservatives, were supported by the Scottish National party after ministers asked for them to be restricted to grants instead of including loans after advice from government lawyers. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-leader, said: \u201cAny company which avoids its responsibility to contribute to society should not be getting handouts when things go wrong. That\u2019s why many European nations and Wales have already made this commitment. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that ministers finally saw sense on this basic issue of fairness. This move isn\u2019t the final word, but it marks the beginning of a new approach to tackling the companies which shamelessly avoid paying tax, and we will continue to build on what\u2019s been achieved today.\u201d In other measures, MSPs were given extra powers to: take over badly run care homes where there was a threat to life; give \u00a319.2m extra for carers; and, in a surprise defeat for the government, extend the life of pop-up cycle lanes and wider pavements to support physical distancing measures. However, the SNP voted with the Tories against measures to freeze rents for two years to protect those on low wages or in arrears during the post-pandemic economic recovery. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the Scottish Green proposals were flawed and could have unintended consequences. The tax haven vote will renew the focus on the Scottish government\u2019s use of offshore companies, which are set up legally in the UK and pay all the taxes they are expected to pay, in other situations. An investigation by the Guardian and the Ferret website in 2018 found that companies based in the Channel Islands, Dubai and the Cayman Islands had substantial stakes in 47 private finance schemes to build Scottish motorways, schools, hospitals and colleges. The analyst Dexter Whitfield found that offshore firms and investors were involved in about 60% of those Scottish government-backed schemes, which will cost \u00a32.7bn to build but will cost taxpayers nearly \u00a38bn in total once the borrowing, interest, management fees and running costs are paid off. The Welsh government blocked companies with headquarters in a tax haven from accessing its \u00a3500m economic resilience fund on 15 May. Ministers in Cardiff said last week it would affect a small number of companies. Rebecca Evans, the Welsh finance minister, said: \u201cWe have put in place the most generous business support package in the whole of the UK. It is only right that businesses which are not contributing tax payments to our economy should not benefit from this scheme.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The majority of employers have implemented physical distancing practices but further steps to make workplaces safe against Covid-19 such as hygiene measures, pandemic leave and a plan to respond to positive cases are rare. Those are the findings of a UComms poll of a representative sample of 1,367 workers for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which paints a bleak picture of workplaces\u2019 preparedness as Covid-19 restrictions are eased Australia-wide. The ACTU is campaigning for paid pandemic leave to allow testing and recovery of sick workers, warning Australia is not ready to go back to work because one in three people do not have access to paid sick leave. The peak union body cites workplace clusters such as the Newmarch House aged care facility in Sydney and Cedar Meats in Melbourne as evidence of the need for a new temporary leave right. The poll found that 70% of workers still in their workplaces reported their employer had adopted social distancing measures. Other measures were much rarer, such as: additional hygiene measures including access to soap and sanitiser (11%), a plan to respond to staff with symptoms (9%), extra workplace cleaning (4%) and paid pandemic leave (1%). Results were similar for workers currently working from home, although they reported lower rates of social distancing (59%) and higher rates of flexibility to continue working from home, 25% compared with 5% for those still attending their workplace. Some 95% of workers said they would previously have considered attending work despite mild respiratory symptoms. But Covid-19 has given workers pause, with 85% saying the pandemic has made them reconsider. Only 10% of workers said they would choose to go to work regardless of having respiratory issues that might indicate a Covid-19 infection. They are more likely to be male, younger and on the lowest incomes, earning less than $31,200 a year. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, told Guardian Australia it was a great concern that most employers had not discussed with employees how Covid-19 prevention measures are going to work in their workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s a human transmitted virus,\u201d she said. \u201cPlans for a safe workplace can\u2019t be in an employer\u2019s heads but not embraced by the workers because they\u2019re the ones that will have to implement them for other workers and customers.\u201d McManus said pandemic leave should be mandatory, and the government should step in and pay if the cost were considered too great for small business. \u201cWe know if we just leave it to a laissez faire approach, for people to one by one decide whether to offer paid pandemic leave or not, because someone is not going to. \u201cIf someone turns up sick and spreads the virus, then it\u2019s not just the one company, or those workers affected, it\u2019s the whole community.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s universities are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">now in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">real crisis</a>. They are not crying wolf, and they are not asking for more money to inflate management salaries or buff up shiny new buildings. If they don\u2019t get more help, some of them could well fold in the near future.</p> <p>This emergency has been in the making for a long time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-uk-universities-face-25bn-tuition-fee-loss-next-year\">Tuition fees</a> have been fixed at the background level of general inflation, way below cost rises inside higher education itself, for nearly a decade; they have been completely frozen for two years. A whole generation of new buildings has been needed to replace worn-out estate from the 1950s and 1960s. Pension costs are rising.</p> <p>Coronavirus is a perfect storm on an already forbidding sea. By obliterating income from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\">international fees</a> and taught postgraduate courses, as well as potentially slashing home undergraduate numbers for at least a year, institutions that were getting into trouble are now lurching towards disaster.</p> <p>What might that mean in the medium- to long-term? With this level of uncertainty, prediction is very difficult indeed, but there probably are three or four lines of march.</p> <p>First and foremost, universities will now be subject to the same, or an even fiercer level of, the austerity that the rest of the public sector has been feeling for a decade. The relatively good years that made things feel merely cramped and gritty, while large sectors of our shared lives fell into decrepitude, are sadly over.</p> <p>The exact level of that pain is still subject to uncertainty. Boris Johnson, who, like David Cameron, always dreamed of being a sunny, expansive prime minister in a time of plenty, might try to spend his way out of any difficulties \u2013 especially on the capital side, where he retains a penchant for costly big-ticket projects.</p> <p>In addition, Johnson won\u2019t necessarily want his \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda threatened. Conservatives will worry if Keele University gets into trouble in a freshly blue seat, and right next to new Tory seats in Stoke-on-Trent; or if the University of Bolton collapses, sitting as it does right next to five more Tory gains from 2019.</p> <p>The Treasury is, however, another matter. By quibbling over help for small businesses and, more ominously, pushing back against a proper rescue package for universities themselves, it has clearly indicated it is going to want back a lot of the money from its limited assistance.</p> <p>Yes, tuition fees have been brought forward. Yes, olive branches may be extended to individual institutions. But the Treasury will say that the money is going to have to come from somewhere. If it doesn\u2019t come from students \u2013 and higher fees seem politically impossible \u2013 it will come from redundancies. It is as simple as that.</p> <p>A second trend will be mergers and \u201crationalisation\u201d. Those universities who do get into really acute financial trouble are unlikely to just shut their doors and put up a \u201cclosed\u201d sign. They are going to put out an urgent request for help \u2013 which is one of the reasons why the government, very unwisely, might let them suffer for now.</p> <p>In that case, regional blocs could be shoved together like Lego, making use of expensive buildings and infrastructure while slimming down the student offer \u2013 and potentially making staff redundant and taking on more part-time teachers.</p> <p>A sprinkling of mergers will look like it is saving the government money, since the cost in chaos and incoherence will only emerge some way down the track, and this course will not only lure Whitehall. Scottish universities, relatively numerous and without recourse to undergraduate fees for Scottish residents, look particularly likely to fall victim to these shotgun marriages.</p> <p>Thirdly, another opportunity the government will seek to wrest from this crisis will be a different sort of merger. Some of what many observers patronisingly and offensively think of as the \u201cweakest\u201d universities may get shoved out of traditional higher education altogether, asked, as they struggle, to get together with groups of regional further education providers (which often offer technical or vocational training).</p> <p>This is where shorter degree-level courses over two rather than three years, teaching over the traditional summer break and research-light teaching might come in, opening the way for future governments to cope with the demographic bulge of 18-year-olds that is about to start. This will be at a much lower cost than allowing them all to claim \u00a39,250 a year for three years.</p> <p>Fourthly, it may be that online and distance learning gets a decisive boost from the cessation of face-to-face teaching, especially if no effective coronavirus treatments or vaccine emerge in pretty short order. Cambridge has already announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/cambridge-university-moves-all-lectures-online-until-summer-2021\">all its lectures will go online</a> during 2020/21, though it\u2019s still planning to conduct seminars and tutorials in person \u2013 at a safe distance.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the full roster of on-campus activities resuming without that sort of progress, and if this physically distanced phase continues for a year or even more some undergraduates may get a taste for it. Living in halls has become enormously expensive: polls show that students are much more worried about their living costs than fees. So-called \u201cblended\u201d learning, in which universities provide more recorded content alongside face-to-face contact, may become more prevalent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing\">When should British schools reopen? Here's what the science tells us | Devi Sridhar and Ines Hassan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is more than possible to be sceptical about this last point. The overwhelmingly young people who take first degrees in the UK have never shown much appetite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/04/i-cant-get-motivated-the-students-struggling-with-online-learning\">for learning from the parental home</a>. But any new coalitions bringing together the less well-established end of higher education with further education might find this an attractive way to further lower costs.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s universities are now entering a white-water phase of change. No more money will be forthcoming \u2013 at least, for the sector as a whole. Some universities will be forced to appeal for individual bailouts.</p> <p>In return, both Whitehall and the devolved administrations will want something back: a cheaper, thinner, less numerous, less homogenous and more \u201cefficient\u201d sector in which managerialism and audit will balloon further.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s universities are now in real crisis. They are not crying wolf, and they are not asking for more money to inflate management salaries or buff up shiny new buildings. If they don\u2019t get more help, some of them could well fold in the near future. This emergency has been in the making for a long time. Tuition fees have been fixed at the background level of general inflation, way below cost rises inside higher education itself, for nearly a decade; they have been completely frozen for two years. A whole generation of new buildings has been needed to replace worn-out estate from the 1950s and 1960s. Pension costs are rising. Coronavirus is a perfect storm on an already forbidding sea. By obliterating income from international fees and taught postgraduate courses, as well as potentially slashing home undergraduate numbers for at least a year, institutions that were getting into trouble are now lurching towards disaster. What might that mean in the medium- to long-term? With this level of uncertainty, prediction is very difficult indeed, but there probably are three or four lines of march. First and foremost, universities will now be subject to the same, or an even fiercer level of, the austerity that the rest of the public sector has been feeling for a decade. The relatively good years that made things feel merely cramped and gritty, while large sectors of our shared lives fell into decrepitude, are sadly over. The exact level of that pain is still subject to uncertainty. Boris Johnson, who, like David Cameron, always dreamed of being a sunny, expansive prime minister in a time of plenty, might try to spend his way out of any difficulties \u2013 especially on the capital side, where he retains a penchant for costly big-ticket projects. In addition, Johnson won\u2019t necessarily want his \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda threatened. Conservatives will worry if Keele University gets into trouble in a freshly blue seat, and right next to new Tory seats in Stoke-on-Trent; or if the University of Bolton collapses, sitting as it does right next to five more Tory gains from 2019. The Treasury is, however, another matter. By quibbling over help for small businesses and, more ominously, pushing back against a proper rescue package for universities themselves, it has clearly indicated it is going to want back a lot of the money from its limited assistance. Yes, tuition fees have been brought forward. Yes, olive branches may be extended to individual institutions. But the Treasury will say that the money is going to have to come from somewhere. If it doesn\u2019t come from students \u2013 and higher fees seem politically impossible \u2013 it will come from redundancies. It is as simple as that. A second trend will be mergers and \u201crationalisation\u201d. Those universities who do get into really acute financial trouble are unlikely to just shut their doors and put up a \u201cclosed\u201d sign. They are going to put out an urgent request for help \u2013 which is one of the reasons why the government, very unwisely, might let them suffer for now. In that case, regional blocs could be shoved together like Lego, making use of expensive buildings and infrastructure while slimming down the student offer \u2013 and potentially making staff redundant and taking on more part-time teachers. A sprinkling of mergers will look like it is saving the government money, since the cost in chaos and incoherence will only emerge some way down the track, and this course will not only lure Whitehall. Scottish universities, relatively numerous and without recourse to undergraduate fees for Scottish residents, look particularly likely to fall victim to these shotgun marriages. Thirdly, another opportunity the government will seek to wrest from this crisis will be a different sort of merger. Some of what many observers patronisingly and offensively think of as the \u201cweakest\u201d universities may get shoved out of traditional higher education altogether, asked, as they struggle, to get together with groups of regional further education providers (which often offer technical or vocational training). This is where shorter degree-level courses over two rather than three years, teaching over the traditional summer break and research-light teaching might come in, opening the way for future governments to cope with the demographic bulge of 18-year-olds that is about to start. This will be at a much lower cost than allowing them all to claim \u00a39,250 a year for three years. Fourthly, it may be that online and distance learning gets a decisive boost from the cessation of face-to-face teaching, especially if no effective coronavirus treatments or vaccine emerge in pretty short order. Cambridge has already announced that all its lectures will go online during 2020/21, though it\u2019s still planning to conduct seminars and tutorials in person \u2013 at a safe distance. It is hard to imagine the full roster of on-campus activities resuming without that sort of progress, and if this physically distanced phase continues for a year or even more some undergraduates may get a taste for it. Living in halls has become enormously expensive: polls show that students are much more worried about their living costs than fees. So-called \u201cblended\u201d learning, in which universities provide more recorded content alongside face-to-face contact, may become more prevalent. It is more than possible to be sceptical about this last point. The overwhelmingly young people who take first degrees in the UK have never shown much appetite for learning from the parental home. But any new coalitions bringing together the less well-established end of higher education with further education might find this an attractive way to further lower costs. The UK\u2019s universities are now entering a white-water phase of change. No more money will be forthcoming \u2013 at least, for the sector as a whole. Some universities will be forced to appeal for individual bailouts. In return, both Whitehall and the devolved administrations will want something back: a cheaper, thinner, less numerous, less homogenous and more \u201cefficient\u201d sector in which managerialism and audit will balloon further. It is not much of an appealing prospect. \u2022 Glen O\u2019Hara is professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University",

The currency collapsed, the major credit ratings agencies devalued Suriname to junk status and by May, the Oppenheimer bonds were trading at 35% of their original price.

If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.</p> <p>Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. \u201cThe loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle-class support, particularly in the capital where opposition parties have grown rapidly\u201d said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition\u2019s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.</p> <p>That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize rallies<br>or reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a 10-person team.</p> <p>\u201cIn the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There\u2019s been no oversight of what\u2019s happening in the interior and Bouterse\u2019s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,\u201d said Breeveld. </p> <p>Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.</p> <p>\u201cSurinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela\u201d he says. \u201cShould Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.\u201d</p>",

To cover the cracks, the government raised more than $1.5bn in Chinese loans, development finance and a $550m 10-year bond from Oppenheimer, a New York investment bank. It wasn\u2019t enough. The currency collapsed, the major credit ratings agencies devalued Suriname to junk status and by May, the Oppenheimer bonds were trading at 35% of their original price. According to Winston Ramautarsing, head of the Surinamese Society of Economists, 38% of government income goes to servicing debt. \u201cThe situation is unsustainable, we don\u2019t have enough income to pay local salaries and \u2013 having taken expensive loans from all over \u2013 we are now going to pay the true cost,\u201d he said. In February the situation came to a head when a $100m hole in foreign currency reserves was discovered after the Central Bank had ordered commercial banks to place 50% of deposits with them. \u201cWe warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted \u2013 it hasn\u2019t published a report since 2014 \u2013 but they didn\u2019t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers\u2019 foreign exchange to cover the government\u2019s imports,\u201d said Ramautarsing. Suriname\u2019s long-term economic prospects could be brighter, however. In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment. Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. \u201cThe loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle-class support, particularly in the capital where opposition parties have grown rapidly\u201d said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo. But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition\u2019s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast. That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize rallies or reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a 10-person team. \u201cIn the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There\u2019s been no oversight of what\u2019s happening in the interior and Bouterse\u2019s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,\u201d said Breeveld. Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region. \u201cSurinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela\u201d he says. \u201cShould Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Covid-19 has killed more than 32,000 people in Italy and wreaked havoc on the healthcare system and economy. But as the country creeps out of lockdown, the toll on mental health is beginning to become apparent. In a recent survey by Italy\u2019s order of psychologists (CNOP), eight in 10 Italians said they needed psychological support to overcome the pandemic, a much higher response compared with similar surveys done in the past. Psychologists have also reported a rise in the number of people turning to them as they try to navigate the ongoing fear of the virus, the emotional impact of physical distancing and economic distress. Sara Reginella, a psychologist in Ancona, in the Marche region, noted an increase in anxiety and depression at the beginning of the lockdown that was connected to the isolation of staying at home. Even though some freedoms have been restored, she said many people have chosen to stay indoors as they feel safer there. Now with Italy on the brink of a deep recession, psychologists warn of a cataclysm in mental health as people struggle with financial hardship. \u201cThere are threats to people\u2019s basic needs \u2013 they are losing their jobs and homes and worrying about providing for their children\u2019s future,\u201d Reginella said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about self-fulfilment or spiritual needs but survival.\u201d Since the beginning of March, 37 people have killed themselves in Italy and 25 have attempted suicide, according to figures gathered by BRF Onlus, a mental health research foundation. The National Federation of Nurse Guilds confirmed that four nurses on the frontline of the pandemic killed themselves, with the organisation attributing the cause to the overwhelming stress they endured. The suicides of two other people are known to have been triggered by the lockdown. On 6 May, two days after Italy started to ease restrictions, the owner of a small business on the outskirts of Naples was found dead in his office. Another four small business owners attempted suicide during the first week of the month. \u201cFrom our research, suicides are only slightly higher than the average over two months,\u201d said Armando Piccinni, the president of BRF Onlus. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if these people were already depressed or receiving treatment. But what is alarming is that some of the cases were clearly related to the pandemic.\u201d The last time there was a marked increase in suicides in Italy, particularly among small business owners, was after the financial crisis of 2007. In the years before that, the suicide rate had been decreasing. Maria Santa Lorenzini, a psychologist in Rome, has recently treated business owners who attempted suicide. \u201cEnormous economic difficulties have been created,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who have a fixed income have coped better, but those whose income stopped when the lockdown started have not been helped sufficiently. Many have not yet received the financial assistance they were promised.\u201d Whether the pandemic and its economic ramifications trigger another rise in the number of suicides remains to be seen. However, Piccinni said suicides were the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of the psychological impact. \u201cFor each suicide or suicide attempt, there are hundreds of people living in a state of terror or depression,\u201d he added. The pandemic and uncertainty have exacerbated anxiety and depression in those already suffering, while others are dealing with mental health issues for the first time. Recognising this, the taskforce set up by the Italian government to navigate the country through the post-lockdown era includes the psychologist Elisabetta Camussi. Camussi was unable to speak to the Guardian due to restrictions on interviews with the press, so it is unclear what the plan is to confront the challenges for mental health. The World Health Organization warned last week that coronavirus \u201cmay never go away\u201d and predicted a global mental health crisis caused by the pandemic was looming. Italy\u2019s psychologists have been playing their part in finding a solution, with thousands offering free consultations. \u201cWe have done a lot voluntarily. This is OK but there is a limit,\u201d said Reginella. \u201cThe government ought to pay us to continue offering services for free, as so many people don\u2019t have the money for therapy.

had a side effect of causing more Bluetooth issues for other devices like fitness bands and wireless headphones.<br></p> \n  <p>That won\u2019t happen if the API is integrated because on the operating

change made by Apple, where you can now provide more info like phone numbers and upload keys to health providers for contact tracing, means it\u2019s much closer to Covidsafe now than it used to be.</p> \n  <p>One major difference still between the two is that the Apple API works out who is a potential person who was exposed to coronavirus on the phone while Covidsafe currently uploads every

Disputes can be heard by FWC.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T03:01:39.079Z\">at 4.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec5eca48f08a1782fa7ea84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T02:52:26.440Z\">3.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Treasury has also not done any modelling on what would happen if all the people who are receiving the Covid supplement as part of jobseeker, which doubles it to $550 a week, remain on the payment when it drops back down to the pre-Covid level.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorSiewert/status/1263299264366563328\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yet again, Treasury wouldn\u2019t say if they had been asked to do any modelling on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jobseeker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Jobseeker</a> rate after September. <br> <br>If the Gov doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaisetheRateforGood?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RaisetheRateforGood</a>, over 1 mil people will be living in poverty on $40 a day &amp; the Gov can\u2019t tell us what impact that will have on the economy?</p>\u2014 Rachel Siewert (@SenatorSiewert) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorSiewert/status/1263299264366563328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T02:54:57.437Z\">at 3.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec5ebea8f0886ce4f5d7813\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T02:50:47.704Z\">3.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Luke Henriques-Gomes</strong> has an update on the closure of the Abbotsford Services Australia centre (Centrelink) which <strong>Stuart Robert </strong>said, in a letter to <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>, was due to a tenancy agreement coming to an end.</p> \n  <p>Robert said the department was unable to negotiate a new lease.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will leave the live blog for this evening. In case you missed it, this is the big news of the day: The Northern Territory has been declared free of Covid-19 after the last confirmed patient recovered. Queensland declares it won\u2019t be lectured by NSW on opening the hard border. South Australia is to move to stage 2 restrictions from June 5. Apple and Google released software to better integrate contact tracing with public-sector health apps, but no sign yet of whether it will be integrated into Covidsafe. Myer is to reopen its stores from Wednesday next week. The federal government is \u201curgently\u201d consulting on potential changes to the Fair Work Act after a landmark court decision on casuals yesterday. The federal government has kept open a Centrelink outlet in Melbourne\u2019s inner north after announcing it would be shut yesterday. For the latest in coronavirus news overnight, please check our global live blog. Until tomorrow, stay safe. South Australia police are bringing back static, random breath-testing after it was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Static RBT will begin tomorrow for the first time since March, but officers will now be provided personal protective equipment, and the cleaning regimes will be maintained. There\u2019s going to be an operation from tomorrow aimed at testing road users for drugs and alcohol in their system. Mobile drug and alcohol testing continued during the pandemic. The Australian Financial Review is reporting Myer will open the remainder of its 35 temporarily closed stores from Wednesday next week. The stores include: Belconnen, Penrith, Castle Hill, Chatswood, Parramatta, Sydney City, Bondi, Shellharbour, Warringah, Macquarie, Roselands, Cairns, Brisbane City, Robina, Indooroopilly, Mt Gravatt, Pacific Fair, Ballarat, Bendigo, Doncaster, Eastland, Fountain Gate, Frankston, Geelong, Highpoint, Southland, Werribee, Chadstone, Northland, Melbourne, Knox City, Perth City, Adelaide City and stores in Hobart and Launceston. If you have an iPhone, you may have noticed an update today that includes exposure notifications. This is the long-awaited Google-Apple API that we expect could be integrated into the Covidsafe app and fix a lot of the issues with the iPhone version of the app. You won\u2019t be able to switch it on unless the government agrees to integrate the API into Covidsafe and agrees to all the privacy terms and conditions that come with that. The app update issued last week did fix some of the problems that prevented people had closing the app and not recording Bluetooth handshakes, but this has had a side effect of causing more Bluetooth issues for other devices like fitness bands and wireless headphones. That won\u2019t happen if the API is integrated because on the operating system level the phone is better at coordinating Bluetooth beacons around the other Bluetooth communications going on. I asked Apple and Google this morning whether there were plans to integrate the API into the Covidsafe app and they couldn\u2019t say. The ABC has reported the government is currently evaluating it. It would fix a lot of the issues, and a change made by Apple, where you can now provide more info like phone numbers and upload keys to health providers for contact tracing, means it\u2019s much closer to Covidsafe now than it used to be. One major difference still between the two is that the Apple API works out who is a potential person who was exposed to coronavirus on the phone while Covidsafe currently uploads every key to the server and works it out that way. Here\u2019s Luke\u2019s full report on the government\u2019s backdown on the Abbotsford Centrelink closure: After Luke Henriques-Gomes earlier reported that the landlord of the Abbotsford Centrelink property in Melbourne was blindsided by the government\u2019s plans to shut down the office today, we can now report that the office will remain open for the next three months. More on the crash here: A car has ploughed into a shop at Greenacre in Sydney. There are reports 12 people have been injured: I\u2019m just going to return to the ACCC report on NBN speeds during the pandemic that Amy referred to earlier. Many people believed that lots of people working from home would put a massive strain on the NBN, but the ACCC\u2019s report shows all the doom and gloom projections have not come to pass. The initial dip in March when the restrictions came into effect and everyone was forced home for two months can largely be blamed on retail service providers not buying enough bandwidth \u2013 or CVC \u2013 to meet the demand. NBN Co then began offering much more bandwidth to retailers for free, and the problem fixed. It should show NBN Co, at least, that this charge should be reviewed once the pandemic is over and it stops being free. If not just because, I imagine, a lot of people will continue to work from home now and into the future. Another interesting bit of information is that for video streaming, 50Mbps is pretty good for two simultaneous Netflix HD streams with no issue. Most connections have no issue whatsoever. However, again the report notes that 95% of the underperforming NBN connections tested were on the controversial fibre-to-the-node technology. It will be interesting to see if that improves as upgrades are rolled out over time. The time has come for me to hand over the blog to the inimitable Josh Taylor for the next short while. In news that will disappoint all you Paul Kelly and Nick Coatsworth fans out there, it appears the daily 3:15pm update from the deputy chief medical officer du jour is a thing of the past. Coatsworth released a statement a short while ago announcing the government\u2019s communications response \u201cis entering a new phase\u201d. In place of the daily update, it appears a new advertising campaign will start today and run over the next month. The advertisements remind people to take three steps to help create a COVIDSafe community when away from home. They are to practise physical distancing, good hygiene and use the COVIDSafe app. We are winning - but we have not yet won. We need everyone to stay focused on the things we need to do to protect ourselves and others as we find our \u2018new normal\u2019. Do the three and stay Covid free. Australia is handling the Covid-19 impact better than New Zealand, a group of business leaders has told Jacinda Ardern. According to a report on Kiwi site Newshub, the NZ PM\u2019s Business Advisory Council chair has written to Ardern warning \u201cbecause of the way Australia is approaching the next two stages (of lockdown easing) it is likely to go well in front\u201d of New Zealand on a wellbeing scale. On that note, I will hand you over to the capable hands of Elias Visontay for the next little bit. Thank you for joining me today. I\u2019ll be back with you tomorrow \u2013 so please, take care of you. This is an interesting take from Christian Porter on the border issue: Not long ago we called that competitive federalism \u2013 states have competed against each other for hosting sports events like a grand prix \u2013 now there will be a competition of who can make the best balanced decision to balance the health impact of changes to border closures with the economic uplift you can get to your retail tourism and hospitality sector. This is winding back to the issue we discussed earlier \u2013 at the moment the most valuable thing for Australia is job growth, that is what the federal government is completely committed to. So we\u2019re looking at this federal court decision as to how it can impact our path out of the Covid-19 pandemic and job growth. And we need to do so on an urgent and speedy basis, talk to employer groups and unions to understand the effect of the decision on job growth because no one benefits, the cost impact to business is such that businesses fail and jobs are lost. I\u2019ve spent a bit of time this morning speaking with the group representing public pathology providers. They are less than happy about the government quadrupling its Covid-19 subsidy to the private sector. Reports in the Nine newspapers this morning revealed that private pathology providers had threatened to stop Covid-19 testing unless the subsidy they received was increased from $24.40 per test to $100. The government met their demand. But public pathology providers say they are still only getting $50 per test, despite actually making a loss on some aspects of Covid-19 testing, including testing in rural and remote areas. The Public Pathology Australia chief executive, Jenny Sikorski, said that made it frustrating to watch such a significant subsidy increase handed to the private sector. \u201cThe public \u2013 in terms of the patients and the taxpayer \u2013 I don\u2019t think they benefit from the current Medicare arrangements for Covid testing,\u201d she said. Christian Porter flagged that improving the ability for casual employees to become part-time workers could be an important part of negotiations to fix the uncertainty created by the Rossato decision. He said: Part of that consultation has to be around what is known as casual conversion. For many casuals, there is a right, if they have been in the same position for a considerable period of time, to request a conversion from casual to permanency but that right is not universal. It seems to the government, without anticipating any particular result within 24 hours of the decision, part of the consultations that need to occur on an urgent basis with employers and employees are with the issue of casual conversion, and a greater clarity and universality to that right of request. Porter confirmed that if a high court appeal is lodged, the government will join the case on WorkPac\u2019s side. He also left open the option of legislation to overturn the effect of the decision \u2013 so if employers pay a casual loading to a worker, they will be classed as a casual despite regular permanent work patterns. Porter criticised Labor for ruling out that option: I see from the opposition spokesmen comments they have ruled that out, they say that is wrong and that it would reward small business who have done the wrong thing. That characterises small business very unfairly. Small business has operated in the last decade and an understanding that is widespread how you engage someone, whether permanent or casual, and the concept you would have different pays. That accepted feature of the system, that has been overturned now, quite surprisingly to many. On the issue of border closures, Christian Porter acknowledges that each state has the right to make its own decision. There are clearly legal issues that arise here. Health advice isn\u2019t determinative on its own, of whether or not a border closure would be determined to be constitutional or not, that would turn on all the facts of the circumstances and every individual case. These aren\u2019t easy decisions for state premiers to make but there is a health imperative, an economic imperative and strict constitutional rules around what is permissible and not permissible. The difficulty I think is ultimately, how you balance the health needs, at a given point of time, and they are evolving with the economic imperatives. One thing that needs to be considered by all state premiers, if we want to, for instance, revive our domestic tourism industry we are going to have to rely on domestic patrons, so Australians who were going to Bali will be looking for someone else to holiday. There will be serious competition as to whether they go to Margaret River or the Gold Coast. I think every state wants to be part of that revival in the market. They need to do that in a balanced way, but if you are too late in opening your borders you will miss out on getting an important market and pivoting tourism to the domestic market. Now that is interesting, because the government, in defending the decision of the Fair Work Commission to scrap some penalty rates, said it would not intervene, because the decision had come from the independent umpire. And Labor, which is calling on the government to respect this decision from the federal court, another independent umpire, had plans to reverse the penalty rate cut ruling if it won government. So, as usual in Australian politics, we only respect the decisions of the independent umpires when they align with what a party wanted anyway. Christian Porter has addressed the federal court decision, which gives casual employees working permanent hours the same benefits as permanent workers. He isn\u2019t happy with it, and says the government will consult on the decision \u201con a fairly urgent basis\u201d and legislation to halt the intent of the decision could be enacted. What we will do is consider a range of options. Part of this is considering what is the potential cost impact on small business with this decision. If the cost impact is so great it would cause a lot of small businesses during what is the most challenging time to fold, or go into liquidation, or have to stand people down, that\u2019s not an outcome in anyone\u2019s mutual interest. We have to talk very quickly to business and employee groups to understand whether or not the financial impact of this decision over the next six, nine, 18 months puts businesses in jeopardy. If it does, we need to consider ways we can strengthen businesses so we preserve jobs, because if this decision was handed down six months ago it would have been a very, very different scenario. At the moment the greatest premium for the economy is employment, generating employment and saving jobs. It being past 2pm on a random Thursday, we have another quiet announcement from the government. On 27 January 2020 the Morrison government announced that the Treasury would undertake a public consultation on the merits of the current stamping fee exemption in relation to listed investment companies and trusts (LICs). Stamping fees are an upfront one-off commission paid to financial services licensees for their role in capital raisings associated with the initial public offerings of shares. Following the conclusion of Treasury\u2019s consultation, the Morrison government will move to extend the ban on conflicted remuneration to LICs. These changes will take effect from 1 July 2020. Whilst new LICs capital raisings have largely ceased since the inception of Covid-19, it is important that the ban on conflicted remuneration is extended ahead of any resumption of capital raising activity. Clarifying these arrangements will address any related risk of consumer harm and ensure that stockbrokers, financial advisers and investment managers are clear about the regulatory settings that will apply in this area and investors can continue to invest with confidence in these products. Extending the ban on conflicted remuneration to LICs will address risks associated with the potential mis-selling of these products to retail consumers, improve competitive neutrality in the funds management industry and provide long-term certainty so that this segment of Australia\u2019s capital markets can continue to operate effectively and provide investors with opportunities to diversify their investments. The treatment of equity and debt securities in trading companies (including hybrids), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and listed infrastructure investments will not be impacted by these changes. Maintaining the existing treatment for these investments is designed to ensure that direct capital raising activities which support the economic activity of companies in the real economy are not impacted by these changes. Persons providing personal advice to a retail client in relation to these products will continue to be legally required to act in that client\u2019s best interests. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) will actively monitor arrangements in the lead up to and following the introduction of these changes. A lunchtime Zoom call is hardly a clear black night, and there was no sign of a clear white moon, but there were certainly regulators galore in attendance at a Financial Services Institute of Australasia hook-up today. And not just any geeks on the street: the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, Asic chairman James Shipton and Apra boss Wayne Byres. Lowe used the opportunity to reinforce his statements that negative interest rates were \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d in Australia. \u201cI think the costs of that exceed the benefits,\u201d he said. He said Australia\u2019s economic recovery depended in large part on progress in fighting the coronavirus. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a vaccine it\u2019s going to be a slow recovery,\u201d he said. The RBA has tipped vast sums into the banking system, but Lowe said there were limits to what it could achieve through monetary policy alone. Government spending would be \u201ccrucial\u201d to the recovery, he said. Both Byres and Shipton said other regulatory projects had been put on hold to deal with the crisis. Byres said the banks had acted as economic shock absorbers, and said the decision to ask them to cancel or defer dividends wasn\u2019t taken lightly. \u201cWe hope the impact on dividends from the current Covid-19 crisis will be temporary, however the outlook is uncertain,\u201d he said. The Greens are now considering whether to move a censure motion against Stuart Robert, following the story by Luke Henriques-Gomes with the landlord of the Abbotsford Centrelink disputing the claim the service centre was being shut after the department was unable to come to a tenancy agreement. \u201cIn the absence of an explanation from the Minister, if the landlord\u2019s comments are accurate, the Minister has lied to me in writing and has unnecessarily hurt thousands of people reliant on the Abbotsford Centrelink, Adam Bandt said in a statement. \u201cThe Minister must immediately reach out to the landlord and ensure Abbotsford Centrelink remains where it is. \u201cStuart Robert has been caught out before saying things that are untrue, like that Centrelink services collapsed under an attack from hackers, and he may well have done it again.\u201d \u201cUnless the Minister can clarify the matter and explain what looks like a straight out lie, I\u2019ll be moving to censure the Minister when Parliament resumes, not only for closing a much-needed Centrelink but for apparently lying about it too. \u201cIf there\u2019s an explanation, I\u2019m waiting to hear it. On 20 May 2020, I asked the Minister in writing to meet about this important matter and to date have received no answer. I can only assume he has been caught out yet again and has nothing to say in his defence.\u201d Pauline Hanson is currently trending on Australian social media for demanding borders be reopened, despite having built an entire political movement on the demand borders be shut. Chris Knaus has taken a look at payments to private pathology providers: Given that it will be another big issue as Australia moves into a post-Covid world, Labor\u2019s response, delivered through Tony Burke, to the fair work ruling on casuals working permanent hours being eligible for permanent benefits is worth noting: I have got to say, I\u2019m astonished by the government\u2019s reaction to this the whole way through. Where they are talking about extraordinary sums of money that they believe will now need to be paid as a result. That would only be the case if there has been widespread breaking of the law by Australian employers. I certainly hope that\u2019s not the case. But I have to say if employers much more broadly than WorkPac have been acting in breach of the law, if they have been refusing to give employees the security that they were legally entitled to, then the last thing the parliament should be doing is acting as a protection racket to cover for people who have broken the law. If job security that people are entitled to has not been given to them, then the response from the Australian parliament \u2013 and I have got to say from the Australian government \u2013 should be to make sure that the law is upheld. A whole lot of people, particularly casuals, have found themselves with nowhere to go during Covid-19, have found themselves not entitled to a whole lot of what is offered to people in permanent work. Every Australian right now should be on the side of job security. And this decision says that when a business has not delivered on job security, then the law should step in. We shouldn\u2019t be changing the law to let businesses that have broken it off the hook. This is just one of the reasons why the end of September, when jobkeeper and the Covid supplement for jobseeker are due to end, is very, very concerning: South Australia is planning on dropping back down to stage two restrictions from 5 June. The premier, Steven Marshall, says he understands the wait is frustrating, but the state needs time: We can\u2019t just have a one size fits all,\u201d he said of the staggered approach. \u201cI appreciate that it\u2019s frustrating to people and it\u2019s much easier to put the restrictions in place than to take them off. But we are only a few weeks away from being in a very good place in South Australia. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said something quite similar. Phil Lowe says the Reserve Bank is not considering negative interest rates for Australia. At 0.25% Australia has hit its ceiling. (floor, technically, but the limit of the rate cuts, so six of one) Attorney general\u2019s department officials have revealed that although the attorney general, Christian Porter, announced on 14 May that emergency changes to workplace pay deals will be limited to 12 months, the regulation to give effect to that has not been put in place yet. Porter slashed consultation periods to change enterprise agreements from seven days to 24 hours. In order to stave off a disallowance motion pushed by Labor and the Greens, Porter agreed to a One Nation demand that changes, once made, can\u2019t have effect for more than 12 months. Kristina Keneally\u2019s questioning reveals that agreements varied now are not subject to the 12-month sunset period. Officials take on notice when the new regulation will be ready. Officials explained the shorter consultation period was put in to \u201cspeed up\u201d variations of agreements, because businesses wanted to match rapid changes being made to modern awards. They take on notice who they consulted before the change was made. Martin Hehir confirms the department is still looking at IR reform options commissioned by Porter last year: casuals, bargaining, greenfields agreements, \u201cawards and their complexity\u201d, and the broader compliance including wage underpayment. Christian Porter will be talking about this decision at 2.30pm eastern time. Jim Chalmers has been listening to Steven Kennedy\u2019s testimony at the Covid Senate committee. He says it proves the need for a longer term plan from the government: This morning\u2019s comments by the Treasury secretary make it clear that no one \u2013 not the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, the IMF, or private forecasters \u2013 agrees with the prime minister that the economy will \u2018snap back\u2019 any time soon. Not all parts of the economy will recover as quickly as we\u2019d like and that means unemployment will be higher for longer. Support could be better targeted, or tapered, but it shouldn\u2019t just \u2018snap back\u2019 on an arbitrary timeline which doesn\u2019t reflect the reality in workplaces and communities. The Morrison government doesn\u2019t have a genuine plan for jobs as we move from responding to the immediate crisis into the long and patchy recovery phase. This word just keeps popping up, again and again and again Labor\u2019s Murray Watt has asked about which organisations are responsible for complaints about jobkeeper. The Fair Work Ombudsman says the ATO deals with eligibility including the application of the one-in all-in rule; the FWO deals with general workplace rights including the minimum wage and not to be discriminated against; and the Fair Work Commission hears disputes about directions to work. Asked about a worker in a cafe who was told they wouldn\u2019t get jobkeeper unless they helped with construction and renovation of the cafe, Martin Hehir, deputy secretary, of the industrial relations group at the attorney generals department, says: As a condition to access/be nominated, that would seem to go against the intent of the scheme. You can\u2019t put preconditions on the nomination \u2013 it has to be based on rules [about eligibility]... In terms of disputes about what is reasonable, if a worker is receiving the jobkeeper payment, the employer is able to provide a direction to reduce hours. They can also direct them to perform any duties within their skill and competency, as long as they hold the relevant licence or qualification. Disputes can be heard by FWC. Treasury has also not done any modelling on what would happen if all the people who are receiving the Covid supplement as part of jobseeker, which doubles it to $550 a week, remain on the payment when it drops back down to the pre-Covid level. Luke Henriques-Gomes has an update on the closure of the Abbotsford Services Australia centre (Centrelink) which Stuart Robert said, in a letter to Adam Bandt, was due to a tenancy agreement coming to an end. Robert said the department was unable to negotiate a new lease. The landlord has told Luke that the first they heard of the decision was on Twitter. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, told local MP and Greens leader, Adam Bandt, by letter on Wednesday that the landlord had advised the agency they would \u201cnot retain Services Australia as a short-term or long-term tenant and will not permit any occupancy by the agency at the premises after the lease expires\u201d. Robert said: \u201cLet there be no misunderstanding \u2013 despite the agency actively engaging with the landlord over an extended period, a lease agreement has not been reached.\u201d He claimed the landlord was \u201calso unwilling to permit a lease holdover arrangement to allow further lease renewal negotiations, or to locate a suitable alternative premises\u201d. But the landlord, Salta Properties, flatly denied the claims, saying it was completely blindsided by the news. The ACT is still (known) active Covid free \u2013 no new cases have been diagnosed in the past 24 hours. That is from 311 tests. Phil Lowe again says there is a limit to what can be achieved through monetary policy. He says there needs to be moves in terms of reform. \u201cThere is no shortage of reports filled with ideas on how to do this and how to make Australia a great place to expand, to innovate [and invest in],\u201d he says. Philip Lowe is speaking at this event. The RBA governor says total hours worked fell by 9% in the past month, but early indications for May show that the drop may not be as large as first thought. He says the sooner the economy can be opened once again \u2013 safely \u2013 the better the reversals. But he says confidence has taken a pretty big hit and people are facing reluctance to go out and spend. Treasury officials have revealed that the list of employers claiming the jobkeeper payment will not be published. This is standard for the Australian Tax Office, according to officials, but Rachel Siewert queries why, given it\u2019s public money. Siewert (and Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally) also want to know whether employers are making use of new provisions allowing as little as 24 hours notice to seek changes to enterprise agreements. The attorney general\u2019s department said there have been 30 enterprise agreement variations since the new rules were introduced. The Fair Work Commission\u2019s general manager, Bernadette O\u2019Neill, says just 14 applications sought to make use of the short consultation period (the old rules required at least seven days\u2019 notice). Only five have been decided, and they ranged from consultation periods of one day to six days. O\u2019Neill takes on notice whether the 14 variations were agreed by the relevant union. She said the FWC was not consulted before attorney general Christian Porter made the change \u2013 but it is \u201cnot necessarily the case\u201d that there is always consultation. The FWC is \u201ccompletely agnostic\u201d as to the merits of the change, she said. Asked about FWC president Iain Ross\u2019s comments, reported in Workplace Express, of an expectation of a \u201csurge\u201d in unfair dismissal complaints, O\u2019Neill confirms Covid-19 has caused \u201csignificant pressures\u201d at the FWC due to jobkeeper and an increase in lodgments for unfair dismissal. O\u2019Neill confirms FWC has asked for extra resources. AAP has this dispatch from Western Australia, which, in the light of the current environment, you may find interesting: Western Australia\u2019s government insists there\u2019s nothing untoward about the sudden departure of China\u2019s consul general amid escalating trade tensions. Health minister Roger Cook has confirmed Zhihua Dong has returned to Beijing, citing health reasons. A prominent figure in WA politics since assuming the role last year, Ms Dong made frequent public appearances with state government officials and penned several newspaper opinion articles encouraging tourists to visit China. Last month, she was invited by billionaire Andrew Forrest to speak at a state government press conference in a move that is believed to have blindsided WA officials. \u2018My understanding is that Madam Dong is returning to China for health reasons,\u2019 Mr Cook told reporters on Thursday. \u2018I have no reason, and I believe the government has no reason, to believe otherwise. \u2018Madam Dong has been a wonderful advocate for Western Australia and has been terrific for the relationship between Western Australia and the Republic of China. Obviously we will miss her. We wish her all the very best and a very speedy recovery.\u2019 WA has cultivated close economic ties with China across successive Labor and Liberal governments and is heavily reliant upon Chinese demand for its iron ore. But the relationship between Canberra and Beijing is badly strained, with China slapping an 80 per cent tariff on barley imports following Australia\u2019s push for a global coronavirus inquiry. \u2018We look forward to continuing to have a strong relationship with China, because we know that Western Australians and Western Australia\u2019s jobs and economy depend upon a strong trading relationship, not just with China but with all our near neighbours,\u2019 Mr Cook said. \u2018We have a very deep relationship with China, it goes across all parts of industry and all parts of government.\u2019 Over in the Covid Senate select hearing, Treasury has confirmed it won\u2019t be releasing, at least publicly, which employers have signed up for jobkeeper. Richard Marles was asked to respond to Joel Fitzgibbon\u2019s comments that Coalition governments had been \u201cdemonising\u201d the Chinese and their system of governance when he was on Sky News a little later. He attempts to walk back the comments to Labor\u2019s established lines: The relationship with China has been going in a bad direction way before Covid-19 turned up. So let\u2019s be clear: the call for an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus is quite right and we support it. It\u2019s what should be happening. But well before that, this relationship has been going in the wrong direction. And I think it\u2019s been hard to really get a clear sense of direction from the government about what the underlying principles that guide philosophies in terms of how they are relating to China. And too often we don\u2019t see or hear from our foreign minister or even our prime minister in relation to the rise of China \u2013 there is real leadership missing at the highest level. And instead the relationship seems to be defined by the fringes of the government and the governments MPs. And I think that is certainly not helping the issue. It\u2019s a very complex, it\u2019s a very serious, relationship. It\u2019s one where we clearly have a significant engagement economically. It\u2019s one where if you want to walk down the path and try and put a black or a white hat on China, you are going to get the answer wrong. This is complex. And what it means is that you\u2019ve got to build relationships and you\u2019ve got to have some ballast in there so that you can deal with the difficult moments \u2013 and this is one of them. And it\u2019s really important that that relationship is deep so that we can give difficult messages when that\u2019s required, and it\u2019s being required in other areas, such as South China Sea. But in a moment such as this, when we\u2019re calling for an independent inquiry, we need the ballast in the relationship in order to do that. I think that\u2019s one of the issues that has played out right now. You are going to be hearing more and more about this issue If you have enjoyed your iso-bubble, you may enjoy this Earlier, Steven Kennedy said the review of jobkeeper does not have terms of reference or a call for submissions, but Treasury is talking to external stakeholders including business and academics. Kennedy gave some hints about the review \u2013 confirming it would consider whether some industries need the payment for longer, and the \u201ctaper rates\u201d and incentives, in terms of how the wage subsidy interacts with the jobseeker unemployment benefit. Kennedy said both jobkeeper and the coronavirus supplement on jobseeker were \u201cdesigned to be temporary schemes, and I think rightly so\u201d. Kennedy said Treasury had been aware it would conduct a review at the three-month mark \u201csince the inception of the policy\u201d on 30 March. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally noted the review was not mentioned when the policy was announced and the first Scott Morrison or Josh Frydenberg had mentioned it was at a press conference on 14 May. As Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said, it is their money. But later, when they go to retire, and their overall super has taken a hit, well, that\u2019s another story. Not Covid-related, but a very big issue facing Australia as we move into the next stage \u2013 Mark Butler has responded to the government\u2019s energy \u201croadmap\u201d. There\u2019s two pathways for this government. Either they can embrace the future of electricity, which around the world is recognised as being renewable energy, the cheapest, the most reliable, the cleanest way of renewing ageing electricity systems around the world. To the extent this road map does it, we\u2019ll embrace it. Or they will continue to pander, frankly, to the extremists in their party room that are determined to cling to the past rather than embrace the future. I think it still remain to be seen which of those two choices Scott Morrison intends to take with this road map. I do make the point, though, a road map that sets out electricity technology is useful as far as it goes, but it\u2019s no substitute for an investment framework that makes that technology a reality for Australia\u2019s electricity system. We desperately need investment. Investment collapsed last year by 50%. Our electricity system is ageing. Much of it operating beyond its design life and we\u2019ve got to move from technology reports to actual investment Not having terms of reference makes it easier not to hint ahead of time what the government is considering doing. Treasury officials have updated numbers on government supports: 900,000 businesses enrolled for jobkeeper, covering \u201ca bit over 6m\u201d workers. 1.65m people have applied for early access of superannuation, totalling $13.2bn Treasury says they are not aware of Apra or any super funds writing to them to say they are experiencing liquidity issues, but takes the question on notice. Liberal senator James Paterson asks a series of questions about border closures and the effect on the domestic tourism market \u2013 obviously lobbying for states such as Queensland to open up \u2013 but Treasury doesn\u2019t have much information on it, and takes them on notice. Just in case anyone thought we were a nation of Ned Kellys, AAP has this report: Confined at home due to coronavirus, Victorians looked through their window and dobbed in their neighbours. Calls to the Victorian police assistance line almost doubled after lockdown directives came in, police minister Lisa Neville said on Thursday. They jumped from 61,000 in February to 102,000 in April, forcing police to bring in 18 Australian Defence Force staff to assist with demand that had pushed waiting times up to eight minutes. \u2018I don\u2019t think we understood what an important role it would play and how committed Victorians were to ensuring that people followed the advice,\u2019 Minister Neville said. This substantial partnership with the community, Ms Neville said, translated into 21,000 calls about mass gatherings, 5,000 calls about businesses operating inappropriately and about 39,000 calls about self isolation breaches. Since police started enforcing social distancing and self-isolation laws on March 23, more than 50,000 compliance checks have been done and more than 5000 fines issued. This eagerness to make sure people were adhering to the guidelines showed people were doing the right thing and holding others to account, Deputy Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said. \u2018It\u2019s about saving lives, it\u2019s about stopping people being put at risk. So we absolutely welcome people ringing up police assistance line,\u2019 he said. The fact Victorians had to stay at home, Patton said, also helped decrease crime. The reduction in residential and commercial burglaries and robberies in April, among other crimes, marked the lowest daily average of offences of any month since June 2014. Since the government relaxed the early access conditions for superannuation, more than 1.6m people have applied to withdraw more than $13bn from funds. Steven Kennedy tells the Covid committee he is \u201cnot particularly concerned about the level of debt Australia is left with\u201d at the end of the pandemic. He says debt would be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d but given the economic shock it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to respond in the way the government has (with $194bn of fiscal stimulus). He says: \u201cWe as a country \u2013 amid all the global gloom \u2013 are looking pretty good. We\u2019re handling the health crisis well, we\u2019re in a sound fiscal position and I believe \u2013 I realise this is contested \u2013 there was a very quick response from the fiscal side ... So far so good.\u201d Kennedy notes that government revenues will decline but if the structural budget is sound, then a focus on full employment will mean that debt issues will \u201csolve themselves\u201d. Growth of 4.5% or stronger would help bring debt down quickly \u2013 the key is restoring \u201cdemand confidence\u201d, so measures such as GDP growth, full employment and wages growth are more important than debt. As Kennedy concludes his evidence, Katy Gallagher says the committee is \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the flow of information from Treasury and recognises this is not solely its responsibility/fault (ie PMC has classed modelling as cabinet in confidence). But she clarifies it is not the committee\u2019s view that Treasury is obstructing the inquiry (Rex Patrick earlier said it was his view). The ACCC is now monitoring NBN speeds. Its first report shows that yes, you did see a drop in speed when we all started working from home, but it was rectified. Steven Kennedy has addressed Adam Morton\u2019s report on the leaked Covid commission manufacturing taskforce\u2019s massive plan to expand the gas sector. Kennedy said he\u2019s aware of the news report, but hasn\u2019t read the draft briefing paper, and takes on notice whether anyone else in Treasury is aware of it. Kennedy said the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission has not commissioned work from Treasury. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been asked to model their proposals,\u201d he said. Peter Dutton also called in for his weekly love-in with Ray Hadley on Sydney radio 2GB. The \u201cproud Queenslander\u201d says \u201cthe public needs to keep the pressure up here\u201d because it is \u201chard to understand the logic\u201d the premier is applying to the border closure. If she had a sound basis then people could easily agree with her position, but it\u2019s clear that she just doesn\u2019t have a logical argument. There hasn\u2019t been a huge amount of noise on this issue from the LNP in Queensland \u2013 and that seems to be because a lot of Queenslanders are actually in agreement with the border closure. But there is a state election to be held in October, so Queensland, despite taking the same stance as WA, Tasmania, SA and the NT, seems to be taking all the heat. Dutton says Palaszczuk is conducting \u201csome social experiment while tourism operators are going broke and their families are being destroyed\u201d. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has accused Treasury of \u201cobstructing\u201d the Covid-19 inquiry by refusing to release modelling about projected unemployment, labelling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Patrick said he will start using freedom of information to get at the modelling. The chair, Katy Gallagher, says the committee will be \u201cresponding to you more formally than that\u201d \u2013 which indicates Labor and other members share their concerns and plan to write to the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy. Kennedy suggests the committee include the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in any correspondence, because he had been \u201cguided\u201d by its view on consideration of material. Gallagher asks if PMC had instructed Treasury not to release the modelling. Kennedy says Treasury \u201csought advice on the treatment of documents\u201d and PMC advised they should be treated as cabinet documents which Treasury \u201cwouldn\u2019t usually release\u201d. So basically: yes. Earlier, Kennedy said Australia is \u201cwell past\u201d what would be called a recession, but is cautious about using the term \u201cdepression\u201d because the Covid-19 contraction is a \u201cdisease-led shock\u201d. Unlike a depression, there is no \u201cmassive misallocation of capital or highly dysfunctional credit markets\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not predicting a V-shape recovery. But given the nature of the shock \u2013 if the government responds well with its fiscal levers, we needn\u2019t have an L shaped recovery, which is what people would think when it comes to a depression.\u201d All the people are there after the shock ... All the productive capital at the beginning sits there at end. [The question is] Have you avoided the destructive cycle of firms going broke, running out of cash, and people losing confidence and becoming very precautionary.\u201d It may be time to just scrap everything and start again: Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth had a morning chat with Alan Jones on Sydney radio 2GB. I missed it originally, as I try to limit my daily rage quota and mornings on 2GB can be counterproductive to that. Coatsworth echoed his colleague Prof. Paul Kelly, that he saw no reason to keep borders closed or for physical restrictions to be so strict. \u201cI think we have to open up, the prime minister said that we can\u2019t let the fear of going backwards stop us from going forwards, and I absolutely endorse that\u201d he said. Jones was tres impressed. \u201cThat is the most significant thing which has been said this morning\u201d. Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi says without access to packages like the jobkeeper wage subsidy, universities could shed up to 30,000 staff. It\u2019s a national day of action for higher education \u2013 Faruqi says universities could not afford to be left off the wage subsidy scheme any longer: It\u2019s time Minister Tehan provided a new funding package for universities and scrapped the unfair rules which have excluded every single university from qualifying for the jobkeeper payment. Universities are some of the most casualised workplaces in the country. This leaves uni workers incredibly vulnerable to downturns in revenue. Universities with large reserves must prioritise staff jobs in spending what money they have. Keeping university staff, including casuals, on payroll should be top of every vice-chancellor\u2019s agenda in managing this crisis. Stephen Jones has again attacked the government\u2019s early super release program (which Labor has never been for) following reports from the AFR some recipients had gambled the money away online. The government has designed a system for speed, not accuracy. Yesterday, Asic raised further concerns that dodgy financial advisors were exploiting the pandemic and charging for access to early release on consolidation of super, which is free through the myGov portal. This Liberals robo-release process is a honey pot for shonks, fraudsters and gambling marketers. Predatory financial advisors and gambling marketers have been enabled by a flawed system which the government created. For the record, if you count the number of people who dropped out of the labour force market statistics, almost 500,000 in the last month, unemployment would already be at almost 10%. Steven Kennedy, the Treasury secretary, is at the Covid-19 committee addressing April\u2019s labour force statistics showing a loss of 600,000 jobs and unemployment rate of 6.2%. Kennedy said that \u201croughly speaking\u201d the figures were in line with Treasury\u2019s estimates that unemployment would reach 10%, or 15% if it weren\u2019t for the jobkeeper wage subsidy. Kennedy noted the second week of April was one with \u201clots of restrictions\u201d on the economy, and the ABS stats showed there were 489,000 people who had left the labour market ie were not looking for work. He said: \u201cIf we put that plus the unemployed, we\u2019d get an unemployment rate of about 9.6%, that\u2019s roughly equivalent to the 10% we expected to see. The thing that we missed was there was a much larger withdrawal from the labour force than we anticipated. I expect they will go back into the labour force and be counted unemployed.\u201d Kennedy noted that mutual obligations have been suspended, but argues workers were \u201csimply unavailable\u201d to work because they were advised to stay home, and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if there is a significant rise in unemployment when the economy reopens and they start looking for work. Kennedy also noted a \u201cdramatic\u201d fall in the number of hours worked, and said the UNDERemployment work is 19.9%. That is quite the escalation from Joel Fitzgibbon there. He wasn\u2019t asked to go further, and instead the interview moved on to how the agriculture sector is feeling, but if Tim Pallas\u2019s comments kicked off furious rebuttal, then Fitzgibbon has just kickstarted a whole new argument. Joel Fitzgibbon appeared on Sky News this morning, where he was asked about Australia\u2019s relationship with China. The shadow agriculture minister went further than either Penny Wong or Anthony Albanese in criticising the government\u2019s handling of the China relationship. Asked if the CCP had been bullying Australia (in terms of the barley tariff), Fitzgibbon says: I don\u2019t know about China bullying us. Certainly we have to be robust in defence of our national interest. But let\u2019s just recap what\u2019s been happening here for the last few years, starting under Malcolm Turnbull. We\u2019ve been demonising the Chinese and their system of governance. Malcolm Turnbull, for example, changed Foreign Investment Review Board thresholds, so that there were special discriminatory rules for the Chinese. They deliberately constructed foreign interest registers with a clear intention of targeting China, for domestic political gain. And of course, now we\u2019ve had our most recent and current prime minister, basically saying things like we should send weapons-style supervisors into China, against their will. I have no idea how he thought he was going to achieve that. So, there have been some problems here in our relationship with China for some time. It\u2019s our largest trading partner, and we need to normalise this relationship again. We can see already through barley and the red meat sector some of the consequences when that relationship is not a healthy one. Meanwhile, globally, the world has seen the biggest daily increase in Covid-19 cases. The Senate select committee looking at the Covid-19 response is holding a hearing today. It\u2019s all about IR and Treasury this morning. Dr Jeannette Young says she is in constant contact with the other members of the national health advisory committee, and each health advisor is choosing to do what is considered best for their own jurisdiction: We were getting together every single day until recently, now it is most days we talk it through. I will at the next opportunity, which is today\u2019s meeting, talk to my colleagues around their plans around the country. I spoke to the West Australian chief medical officer as late as yesterday to talk about their plans. Each state will do what is best for their state. And today, here in Queensland, it is best for us that we continue to minimise movement across our domestic borders. So, of course, we\u2019re allowing people to come into Queensland for compassionate reasons and, of course, to move freight. And there are a number of other areas. But this is not the time for tourists to travel into Queensland. Because one case can cause an enormous setback to our plan to open up our communities. Annastacia Palaszczuk defers to Queensland chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, to explain why Queensland\u2019s health advice is to keep the borders closed, when the deputy chief medical officer of the country, Professor Paul Kelly, says there is no reason to do so: So, there is plenty of health advice about the importance of minimising the number of cases coming in to a community. We saw how effective it was for Australia when the international borders were closed. And then as we started to see in Queensland, the number of cases acquired interstate and then coming into Queensland, we immediately acted here, the premier took that advice to act, and close the borders to other states. And, most of the states in our country also did that. So we saw Western Australia, we saw South Australia, Northern Territory, Tasmania and Queensland close their borders to those states that had significantly higher numbers of cases and local transmission. So, there is a lot of health advice about the importance of minimising the number of cases coming in to a community. Annastacia Palaszczuk: Let\u2019s be very clear, on the border issue we won\u2019t be lectured to by the worst performing state in Australia. There are 33 times the number of active cases in NSW compared to Queensland. So, NSW needs to get its act together and get its community transmission down and we\u2019ll all be better off throughout this nation, including in Queensland. It\u2019s time for Gladys and the NSW government to get their act together and to start performing as well as Queensland has done on the health front. Annastacia Palaszczuk has also been listening to Mark McGowan when it comes to border sledges. She says Queensland won\u2019t be lectured to \u201cby a state that has the highest number of cases in Australia\u201d, in response to Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s repeated calls for Queensland to open the border. Queensland is loosening restrictions again \u2013 for Queenslanders. The greatest nation on earth will allow travel, within the state, of up to 250km from residents\u2019 homes for the school holidays. Annastacia Palaszczuk says that keeping Queensland\u2019s borders closed to the other states means Queenslanders can travel more freely. The NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, says the last active case in the territory has recovered, making the NT (known) Covid-19 case free. I would like to acknowledge these people that have been diagnosed and we have cared for them and we wish them all well. We saw situations where people were transiting through Darwin and they were caught here, we saw defence personnel brought here. It\u2019s been six-and-a-half weeks since we have had a locally diagnosed case but we mustn\u2019t become complacent. Yesterday worldwide saw the highest number of coronavirus cases diagnosed in the world on any particular day. It\u2019s expected worldwide today we\u2019ll go over five million diagnosed cases and there are more cases that are undiagnosed. The Northern Territory through the tough measures we put in place early, we are a safe bubble and we need to keep it that way. We have a very vulnerable community, population, particularly with our Aboriginal Territorians and so I urge all Territorians to not become complacent off the back of this, to keep vigilant. The physical distancing, personal hygiene and if you are not feeling well, stay home. On the finance side of things, AAP has this report: The Australian share market is set to rise in early trade after US investors continued to look to a swift recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The SPI 200 futures contract was higher by 36 points, or 0.65%, to 5,604.0 at 0800 AEST on Thursday. The three major Wall Street indices notched finished higher overnight as investors bet on a swift economic recovery from coronavirus-driven lockdowns and the potential for more stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.52% to end at 24,575.9 points, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.67%, to 2,971.61. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.08% to 9,375.78. In Australia on Thursday, the heads of Apts, Asic and the Reserve Bank will discuss their Covid-19 response in an online forum held by the Financial Services Institute of Australasia. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Wednesday up 13.5 points, or 0.24%, at 5,573 points. The All Ordinaries index gained 21.3 points, or 0.38%, to 5,680.1. The Australian dollar was buying 65.96 US cents at 0800 AEST, up from 65.43 US cents at the close of trade on Wednesday. Angus Taylor also spoke on the border closure issue while on the ABC: Well, I think ultimately it\u2019s a decision for Queensland but the advice coming in is very clear from the chief medical officer and it\u2019s clear what the New South Wales premier has put her view as well. What I want to see is opening up, getting things going again, jobs, investment and of course we have got to make sure all our policies are aligned with that at the federal level and we\u2019d like to see states do the same and that includes our emissions policy which is all about strengthening the economy. Speaking to the ABC a little earlier, Gladys Berejiklian says she did not think it was \u201clogical at this stage to maintain those border closures for a prolonged period of time\u201d. She prefaced the comment with \u201cthat\u2019s a matter for the Queensland premier and the Queensland government\u201d before giving her opinion, so that might tell you how relations within national cabinet are starting to go. Berejiklian says it is all about jobs: New South Wales is in a position now where we\u2019re really focused on jobs and the economy, and we\u2019ll be able to get our industries up and running. But for Australia to really move forward as a nation during this very difficult economic time as well as difficult health time, we do need our borders down, we do need to allow people to move between states, to live, to work, to see family. And that\u2019s why I was pleased that both New South Wales and Victoria, we actually kept our borders completely open during the pandemic \u2013 admittedly, because we\u2019re the largest states, I [presume] the smaller states wanted to limit anyone from our states visiting them who might have the virus. But I think that those concerns have now been allayed, given the small number of new cases we\u2019re seeing across the nation. And what\u2019s really critical to us now as a nation is to get the jobs going, is to stop us falling off an economic cliff in a few months\u2019 time. And that should be cause for concern for all of us. And the best way we can manage that is by allowing people to move freely. Gladys Berejiklian says NSW will also bring forward, and accelerate, many of its infrastructure projects in a bid to kickstart the NSW economy. Whilst dealing with the health issues, we are keeping a keen eye on the economy. It\u2019s all about jobs, getting back those hundreds of thousands of jobs we have lost in New South Wales, it does play on our mind every day. I want people to feel secure if they have a job and certainly to feel they can get a job if they\u2019ve lost their job and that\u2019s why New South Wales whilst we always take a no regrets policy in relation to saving lives we certainly will maintain our assertive policy in terms of reopening the economy and getting jobs back and making sure that we can sustain that. That\u2019s really critical to the future. We don\u2019t want to be in a position where we see more people losing jobs. More than 220,000 jobs lost in April is beyond our wildest expectations in terms of what could have happened and we are certainly in the phase of doing everything we can to open our economy to get people working, whether it\u2019s from home or whatever works best for them but also maintaining the public safety through social distancing. NSW health authorities tested 9,700 people for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours and returned just two positive results, Gladys Berejiklian says as part of her daily briefing. One case was from Melbourne, and the second is still under investigation (which is how they say they are not immediately clear on where it was picked up). Asked where the government stands on the so-called Hele (high-efficiency low-emission) coal-fired power plants many in the Coalition backbench are quite enamoured with, Angus Taylor says they are still in the mix. Again the point here is balance, Fran, you know, extreme solutions are not going to work here. We need to have a range of technologies [and] many horses in the race. There wasn\u2019t a lot new that was in that interview with Angus Taylor. \u201cBalance\u201d seems to be his favourite word at the moment, which is why he says Australia is still backing in fossil fuels like gas. Asked by Fran Kelly why Australia just \u201cdoesn\u2019t back a winner\u201d, like low-emissions technologies such as wind and solar, Taylor scoff-lols and says: You need, you need balance,\u201d he said. Look it\u2019s not just about electricity, either, this is across all sectors. And it\u2019s crucial we have a range of technologies that can play a role in all these sectors \u2013 there\u2019s been enormous focus, by the way, on electricity which is about a third of our emissions \u2013 two-thirds of our emissions [are] across industry, transport, agriculture, and we have to focus on technologies in those areas as well and of course carbon capture and storage can play a very very important role there on the manufacturing side in particular. Angus Taylor just spoke to Fran Kelly on ABC radio and this is a pretty accurate summary from Adam Morton here, about how the conversation, at least from Taylor\u2019s side, went. Gladys Berejiklian had a chat to ABC News Breakfast this morning and again pushed for borders to be open across the nation \u2013 saying it was not \u201clogical\u201d to keep them closed. While the borders are the short-term concern, Adam Morton has this report on what is likely to be a long-term issue for Australia There are a lot of potential changes being floated in terms of Australian economic policy, under the guise of \u201cCovid recovery\u201d. The border issue is once again dominating headlines, with Gladys Berejiklian pushing for Queensland (mostly), to open its borders to NSW. Queensland is saying no. As is Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia. Yesterday, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he could see no medical reason to keep the borders closed. But Queensland, as well as the rest of the closed-off states, say their health advice is to keep them closed \u2013 particularly while there is still evidence of community transmission in NSW and Victoria. Which there is. Mark McGowan hit NSW with a Ruby Princess jibe yesterday, saying he wouldn\u2019t be taking border advice from the state which let the cruise ship dock and the passengers disembark. But the feds are on the side of NSW and are also pushing for it to open. Pauline Hanson has hired a lawyer to test to constitutionality of Queensland\u2019s border closure. \u201cIt is unconstitutional for Premier Palaszczuk to close Queensland\u2019s border and her actions are causing me a great deal of concern for the economic viability of our state,\u201d Hanson wrote on social media. We\u2019ll cover all the day\u2019s events as they happen, so thank you again for joining us. You have Amy Remeikis with you for this slice of the day. Ready?",

      "body": "<p>Paul Myners well knows the devastation a financial crisis can cause. He was the finances services secretary to the Treasury when the world recession hit in 2008 and, as he was drawing up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/review-recommends-change-in-attitude-to-restore-trust-in-premiership-clubs\">his report on the Premiership\u2019s salary cap</a>, sport went into lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. He laced his findings with reminders to a business that was already struggling to become sustainable with timely warnings. \u201cTheir long-term financial viability was not assured before this moment,\u201d he said of the Premiership clubs. \u201cIt is far less so now.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Myners viewed the cap as a safety valve against unsustainable losses and, although he was too polite to couch it in such undiplomatic language, he clearly viewed the current regulations as a pile of manure, designed neither to ensure nor enforce compliance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/20/fear-among-premiership-players-that-some-clubs-could-go-bust-by-christmas\">Premiership players fear some clubs could go bust by Christmas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was not so much the wording he despaired at as the application, with the clubs who drew them up interfering in the disciplinary process and acting primarily out of self-interest. Breaches before the ones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/saracens-docked-35-points-and-5m-fine-for-salary-cap-breach\">that cost Saracens their place in the top flight</a> were covered up and the process was shrouded in secrecy.

      "bodyText": "Paul Myners well knows the devastation a financial crisis can cause. He was the finances services secretary to the Treasury when the world recession hit in 2008 and, as he was drawing up his report on the Premiership\u2019s salary cap, sport went into lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. He laced his findings with reminders to a business that was already struggling to become sustainable with timely warnings. \u201cTheir long-term financial viability was not assured before this moment,\u201d he said of the Premiership clubs. \u201cIt is far less so now.\u201d Lord Myners viewed the cap as a safety valve against unsustainable losses and, although he was too polite to couch it in such undiplomatic language, he clearly viewed the current regulations as a pile of manure, designed neither to ensure nor enforce compliance. It was not so much the wording he despaired at as the application, with the clubs who drew them up interfering in the disciplinary process and acting primarily out of self-interest. Breaches before the ones that cost Saracens their place in the top flight were covered up and the process was shrouded in secrecy. As ye sow \u2026 The clubs acted like unions in the amateur era, turning their backs on those who were funding the game\u2013 television, sponsors and supporters \u2013 and regarded their business as private.

He came up with a series of recommendations that, if implemented, would place a distance between those who drew up the regulations and those who applied them, strengthening the position of the salary cap manager and drawing club officials, players and agents into the group that needed to be held accountable for any breaches.

A group of nine leading scientists who advised President Barack Obama has warned that the US has just three months to rebuild its stockpile of emergency medical equipment if it wants to be prepared for a second wave of coronavirus in the fall. In a seven-page report, whose lead author was the White House science adviser for both Obama terms, the experts fault the Trump administration for failing to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for a pandemic just like the one we\u2019re living through now. The EU\u2019s coronavirus chief has also warned Europe to brace for a second wave, while another top US scientist, the groundbreaking cancer and HIV researcher William Haseltine, has said countries must work to contain the disease, not count on the possibility of a vaccine being developed, which is \u201cnot a slam-dunk by any means\u201d. Apple and Google have released a tracking app. The two tech firms have developed smartphone technology that can automatically notify people if they may have been exposed to coronavirus, to help track and contain its spread. There is a staggering racial divide in Covid-19 deaths Black Americans are dying from coronavirus at three times the rate of white people, according to figures compiled by the non-partisan APM Research Lab. In certain states the racial divide is even more stark: in Kansas, for instance, black people are dying at seven times the rate of whites. More than 20,000 African Americans have died from the disease \u2013 that\u2019s almost one in 2,000 of the entire black population in the US. As Lois Beckett writes, the government\u2019s pandemic response has been warped by racism, with the health secretary, Alex Azar, apparently blaming the disease\u2019s victims for their ill health: Someone had to be held responsible for an American death toll approaching 100,000 people, worse than any other country\u2019s reported deaths. In order for the Trump administration to remain blameless, someone else had to be blamed, and the administration was now blaming the dead. Trump threatened states for trying to make voting easier Nevada and Michigan are trying to make it easier for people to vote safely and by mail during the pandemic. So Donald Trump has falsely accused both states of facilitating election fraud, and threatened illegally to withhold critical election funding. Trump voted by mail in Florida this year. Meanwhile, the US supreme court has temporarily blocked the House from obtaining secret grand jury testimony from the Mueller investigation, potentially keeping previously undisclosed details of the Trump-Russia investigation out of Democrats\u2019 hands until after the November election. And Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen has been released to serve the rest of his prison sentence at home amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 in prisons. Ukraine has announced an investigation into calls between Joe Biden and its ex-president when both were in office. Heavily edited recordings of the calls were published by a Ukrainian associate of Rudy Giuliani, in an apparent effort to embarrass Trump\u2019s 2020 opponent. Trump is considering an in-person G7 meeting. The president, this year\u2019s G7 leader, had previously moved the June summit to a video conference, but now says he wants to host foreign leaders at Camp David despite the pandemic. Did a frontline Florida nurse take his own life? William Coddington, a 32-year-old nurse who volunteered to treat Covid-19 patients on the frontline of the pandemic in Florida, was recently found dead in his car close to the hospital where he worked in West Palm Beach. Coddington battled opioid addiction for years and possibly succumbed to an overdose. But his family said he was also struggling with the fear, trauma and isolation of the coronavirus crisis, and may have killed himself as a result. More than 85% of American nurses are forced to reuse PPE, according to a survey conducted by a healthcare workers\u2019 union, which also found that 84% of nurses had not been tested for Covid-19. In other news\u2026 A Michigan community faces the threat of toxic pollution after dam failures led to catastrophic flooding near the town of Midland on Wednesday. The floods could release pollutants from a nearby site contaminated by industrial giant Dow Chemical. The only man convicted for 9/11 is renouncing terrorism. Zacarias Moussaoui, who lied to the FBI about his knowledge of al-Qaida\u2019s plans when he was arrested in August 2001, wrote in a court motion that he would \u201cproclaim unequivocally my opposition to any terrorist action\u201d against the US. The US should expect an unusually fierce hurricane season this year, with experts estimating there will be about 20 named storms from 1 June to 30 November \u2013 eight more than the 30-year average.

But the rest of the world, accustomed to patronising Africa, has all but ignored its successes, says Afua Hirsch.

Now a similar mindset seems set to ensure we don\u2019t learn the lessons Africa has to offer in overcoming it.

On what time frame were at-risk Americans supposed to become thinner in order to protect themselves from a pandemic already in their communities?</p> <p>But Cassidy\u2019s fat-shaming was familiar, Gardiner said, a way for some Americans to watch the unfolding death while avoiding any responsibility.

      "bodyText": "Why do Americans represent less than 5% of the world\u2019s population but nearly a third of the known coronavirus death toll? Not because of government incompetence, the Trump administration is arguing, but because Americans are very unhealthy. The United States\u2019 organized response to the pandemic had been \u201chistoric\u201d, Trump\u2019s health secretary, Alex Azar, told CNN on 17 May, but America \u201cunfortunately\u201d has a \u201cvery diverse\u201d population, and black Americans and minorities \u201cin particular\u201d have \u201csignificant underlying disease\u201d. Jake Tapper, the CNN anchor interviewing Azar, paused and squinted. Surely, he asked, Azar was not arguing that \u201cthe reason that there were so many dead Americans is because we\u2019re unhealthier than the rest of the world?\u201d Azar doubled down: \u201cThese are demonstrated facts.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the fault of the American people that the government failed to take adequate steps in February \u2026\u201d Tapper said. \u201cThis is not about fault. It\u2019s about simple epidemiology,\u201d Azar said, adding in a pious tone: \u201cOne doesn\u2019t blame an individual for their health condition. That would be absurd.\u201d Blaming black Americans for dying from a novel virus because they had diabetes or high blood pressure was precisely what Azar was doing. Someone had to be held responsible for an American death toll approaching 100,000 people, worse than any other country\u2019s reported deaths. In order for the Trump administration to remain blameless, someone else had to be blamed, and the administration was now blaming the dead. It took less than a month after the first shelter-in-place orders to devolve into a full-blown partisan culture war, complete with armed protests egged on by the president; conservatives questioning or denying death numbers; pundits arguing against a continued lockdown with lines like, \u201cYou can call me a Grandma killer\u201d; attempts by hair salons and barbers to stage acts of civil disobedience; and some states led by Republican governors moving to quickly reopen, even as other states with Democratic governors announced months of continued restrictions. A majority of Americans remain supportive of public health restrictions, including nearly half of Republican voters and 68% of people who have lost a job or suffered a pay cut. The anti-lockdown demonstrations at state capitols have attracted a messy jumble of protesters: anti-vaccine activists and other conspiracy theorists, rightwing provocateurs, members of known anti-government militias, gun rights advocates, established conservative groups backed by wealthy billionaire donors, Republican stalwarts and people who were actually out of work. It would be wrong to argue that racism was the sole motivation for the protests, or even a decisive factor for the many different protesters who showed up. But the moment when the US response to coronavirus escalated into a full culture war is revealing. The big protests at state capitols, with crowds of white Americans demanding their governors reopen the economy, started about a week after national news outlets began reporting in early April that black Americans made up a disproportionate number of the dead. Systemic racism created the health disparities that made black and brown Americans more vulnerable to dying from coronavirus, public health experts say; and now the same racism is also shaping, and undermining, the country\u2019s political response to the pandemic. Back to the Puritans It\u2019s not surprising that Americans, who are used to tackling every problem through the lens of \u201cindividual rights\u201d, would struggle with how to respond to the collective demands of a pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s this mismatch in terms of a social problem, and the tools we have at our disposal to make sense of it,\u201d the sociologist Jennifer Carlson said. Americans don\u2019t have much of a national vocabulary for talking about collective action and sacrifice. Jon Stokes, a gun rights activist from Austin, Texas, has strong opinions about tyranny and freedom. But he said he was frustrated that some of his usual allies did not seem to understand that dealing with a novel virus, in a country where no one has immunity, required a different kind of politics. \u201cOur rights are being violated. That is all actually real,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cBut this is one of the few times when that\u2019s OK. Pandemics \u2013 these call for a collectivist response. They don\u2019t work without one.\u201d For some wealthy Americans eager to reopen the economy, the motivating fear may be the risk of social change, the historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz said. \u201cThe capitalist class, those who benefit most from the unequal system, they know it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate not to stay locked down too long, so people get used to fresh air, breathing air without carbon in it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople might get ideas of a different kind of world.\u201d To Dunbar-Ortiz and other historians, Americans\u2019 push to reopen the economy during a pandemic, and some Americans\u2019 willingness to hold armed demonstrations in order to do so, looks like a case of almost psychotic repetition. It\u2019s not a new idea that thousands of people must die to preserve America\u2019s \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. It\u2019s not a new assumption many of those people will be brown or black. The Navajo Nation, where many families do not even have running water to wash their hands, has one of the highest rates of coronavirus in the country. The coronavirus culture war is \u201ckind of a petri dish of all the psychoses of US history\u201d, as Dunbar-Ortiz, the author of An Indigenous People\u2019s History of the United States, put it. European colonists established their settlements in the midst of the mass death of indigenous people and opened the American market for business \u201cat gunpoint, in the wake of that epidemic\u201d, said Patrick Blanchfield, the author of a forthcoming 500-year history of American gun violence. Enslaved black people died performing the essential labor that kept the economy running. The smallpox virus the Europeans had brought to a new continent full of people with no immunity would leave tens of millions of people dead. Today, \u201cwho is being asked to die for the market to be open?\u201d Blanchfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s black people. It\u2019s Native American tribal communities.\u201d Early Puritan accounts of arriving in the New World and seeing indigenous people dying of illness are marked by a familiar self-righteousness. The Puritans look at an epidemic and \u201cthink it\u2019s a divine dispensation\u201d, Blanchfield said. \u201cThe very fact that people are dying is taken as both pragmatically offering market opportunities ... but also as a theological vindication of your own survivorship.\u201d That Puritan instinct to see infection as a sign of guilt, and health as a kind of vindication, is currently playing out across the political spectrum. American liberals sometimes treat their belief in science as a kind of religion, Blanchfield argued, fetishizing technocrats and rejoicing when conservatives who do not \u201cbelieve in science\u201d are punished. Some liberals have posted comments regretting that they could not wish that participants in \u201creopen\u201d protests would get coronavirus, because they might infect other, innocent people, Adam Kotsko, a political theorist, said. After Georgia decided to reopen businesses early, despite continued warnings from public health officials, one liberal activist with a large following tweeted \u201c*sips coffee*\u201d as her only comment on an article reporting that Georgia had seen 1,000 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours. Even as some leftists on Twitter were calling the GOP a \u201cdeath cult\u201d, other leftists were suggesting that the punishment for unbelievers should be death. This impulse to blame other people for getting sick is rooted in fear, said Jonathan Metzl, a professor of sociology and psychiatry at Vanderbilt University. \u201cEveryone wants some narrative, to explain the unimaginable level of illness and death and vulnerability that we\u2019re all feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants there to be a logic to this.\u201d The victim-blaming on the left, though, has come from individuals\u2019 Twitter accounts, not Democratic party leadership. The victim-blaming of black Americans has come from the highest levels of government. \u2018An acceptable sacrifice\u2019 Just days after national news outlets first reported the emerging racial disparities in coronavirus deaths, Trump\u2019s surgeon general, Jerome Adams, said at a White House briefing that communities of color needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and advised them to \u201cavoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs\u201d. \u201cDo it for your Big Mama,\u201d said Adams, who is black. Lecturing individual black Americans about smoking, rather than talking about African Americans\u2019 increased environmental exposure to air pollution, a demonstrated coronavirus risk, was classic \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d, the Rev William J Barber II, co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, and his son, William J Barber III, a climate activist, wrote in the Nation. In early April, some black mayors told media outlets they were afraid that African Americans were not taking the pandemic seriously. Media reports described rumors that black people could not get coronavirus. Ibram X Kendi, the director of the Anti-Racism Research Center at American University, said he was skeptical of these concerns, and of the implication that ignorance was the reason for the racial disparities in infection. Poll results from mid-March had shown black respondents were actually more likely than white respondents to see coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, he said. After crowds of mask-less white protesters had started showing up at state capitols, the claims that black people not taking the virus seriously vanished, Kendi said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, when you have so many white people who are protesting and not social distancing, to argue that they are taking it more seriously and that\u2019s why they are less likely to die,\u201d he said. But the same argument that black Americans were to blame for dying simply evolved, Kendi said, to focus more on their \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d. In Louisiana, Senator Bill Cassidy, a white Republican and a medical doctor, had already cast doubt on whether inequities rooted in systemic racism were the reason so many black Louisiana citizens were dying of coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d he told NPR in early April. The real answer, the answer backed by science, was that \u201cAfrican Americans are 60% more likely to have diabetes\u201d and that \u201cwe need to address the obesity epidemic\u201d. Addressing coronavirus disparities by suggesting that people lose weight did not actually make sense, said Finn Gardiner, an advocate at the Lurie Institute for Disability Policy at Brandeis University. On what time frame were at-risk Americans supposed to become thinner in order to protect themselves from a pandemic already in their communities? But Cassidy\u2019s fat-shaming was familiar, Gardiner said, a way for some Americans to watch the unfolding death while avoiding any responsibility. Americans of all races with larger bodies were left feeling \u201cexpendable\u201d, that they were \u201can acceptable sacrifice\u201d, he wrote. Blaming the victims of American racial disparities for what they suffer has a reliable outcome: nothing is done. The deaths mount. As southern states that have seen some of the starkest racial disparities reopen, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s only going to get worse,\u201d Kendi said. Recent polls of white Americans by a progressive polling firm found that certain white voters were more likely to endorse the idea of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for health disparities when the people affected were black. Ronald Reagan attacked America\u2019s postwar investment in social programs, Kotsko said, \u201cby pointing out that the generosity is now extending to black people\u201d and suggesting that \u201cit\u2019s better to tear down the system of solidarity than to allow the wrong people to get the benefits\u201d. But the victim-blaming of black Americans may also have shaped how white Americans have estimated their own risk. \u201cIf you really thought the coronavirus was going to be lethal to you and your family, would you rush in a big group of people to the statehouse without a mask?\u201d Metzl said. \u201cI think you would only do that if you thought you were somehow safe or immune.\u201d The problem, of course, is that death and life during a pandemic are not actually determined by moral righteousness. Blaming dead people of color for being sinful, rather than trying to fix underlying problems, only leads to many more people dying. Metzl argued in his book Dying of Whiteness that the way racism has shaped gun policy and healthcare choices in this country has led to outcomes that hurt black and brown Americans, but that also led to measurable increases in the deaths of white Americans. Today, he\u2019s afraid that same dynamic is playing out again. But there has only been a \u201cdamning\u201d silence from the White House, Metzl said, on any plan to fix the disparities that are leading to tens of thousands of deaths. It\u2019s not easy to describe what it\u2019s like to be forced to witness the violent repetitions of American history. Listening to other Americans argue that you are responsible for your own death, that your body is inherently expendable, takes a particular toll, said Gardiner, the disability rights advocate, who is black. The Puritans had a form of torture called \u201cpressing\u201d, used during the Salem witch trials. They made the accused person lie on the ground, and then very slowly, over many days, placed one rock on their chest, and then another. The terror for Americans now is not that coronavirus is an unprecedented challenge: it\u2019s that all this is so devastatingly familiar.",

      "bodyText": "Dozens of individuals and groups urging states to reopen amid the Covid-19 pandemic have historical financial ties to coal and oil and gas companies and conservative billionaires who have invested in climate disinformation. Past funders of the current critics of stay-at-home orders include the bankrupt coal company Murray Energy and oil giant ExxonMobil, as well as Koch and Mercer family foundations, according to DeSmog, a group that tracks the money behind anti-climate-action campaigns. Some of the contributions tallied are recent and others are at least five years old or older. ExxonMobil, for example, had broken ties with two of the groups in this story by 2006. There is no evidence that these companies and foundations are funding ongoing campaigns to reopen businesses. But Brendan DeMelle, executive director of DeSmog, said the \u201cinformation echo chamber\u201d of interests downplaying both the climate crisis and the pandemic would not be what it is today without fossil fuel funding. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have direct evidence of specific grant money going for Covid denial, none of these operations would exist without their support over the years,\u201d DeMelle said. Donations to not-for-profit thinktanks are nearly impossible to track in real time because of a lag in reporting. It could take years to reveal which interests are currently funneling money to the groups helping to organize and expand shutdown protests. Even then, much of the funds could be hidden, donated anonymously through third-party not-for-profits, DeMelle said. But DeSmog\u2019s research shows many of the calls to end stay-at-home orders are coming from people associated with a wide-ranging network of organizations that together seek to limit the power of government and thwart intervention in business. That web of thinktanks was built years ago on contributions from the fossil fuel industry and conservative philanthropists. Now, the fossil fuel industry is struggling amid government lockdowns aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and allowing people to move freely and return to work would help the sector by boosting energy demand. As Donald Trump has advocated for a quicker reopening, often against the recommendations of his expert advisers, Republican voters\u2019 views on how to handle the coronavirus have shifted substantially. Just 43% say it is more important for the government to address the spread of the virus than the economy, down from 65% about a month ago. Trump\u2019s calls for a quicker return to regular life have grown in popularity as they have been echoed throughout conservative media, often backed by thinktanks connected to the oil and coal industries. In Wisconsin, where people have protested against a stay-at-home order, the Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) filed an amicus brief with the state supreme court challenging the authority of the governor and the health department to continue to require people to stay home without sign-off from the Republican-controlled legislature. The court last week struck down the state\u2019s order, calling it a \u201cvast seizure of power\u201d. Charles Koch, the 20th-richest billionaire in the world, runs Koch Industries, which is involved in oil operations and energy-intensive industries. He and his late brother, David, have funded a network of conservative thinktanks. Phil Kerpen, a Koch political operative, has argued that lockdowns are \u201cunscientific\u201d, and \u201cmedieval\u201d and don\u2019t save lives. Kerpen is president of American Commitment, a group that through 2016 has received at least $6.9m from Freedom Partners, which is partially funded by the Kochs, according to DeSmog. He was previously vice-president of AFP until 2012. An AFP spokesman said the group has been \u201cunambiguous\u201d in its position that \u201cthe choice between full shutdown and immediately opening everything is a false choice\u201d, and that it is working with officials and businesses to develop standards to \u201csafely reopen the economy without jeopardizing public health\u201d. \u201cPast grants do not define our position on reopening the economy \u2013 to suggest otherwise is disingenuous,\u201d the AFP spokesman said. \u201cNone of the grants referenced have anything to do with stay-at-home orders and some of them were made many years ago.\u201d The Washington Post has reported that the Convention of States, a project launched in 2015 with money from the family foundation of the billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, has helped to coordinate activism against the stay-at-home orders around the country. The conservative thinktank the Manhattan Institute \u2013 which over the years has taken at least $1m from ExxonMobil through 2018, according to the environment group Greenpeace USA, as well as $3.2m from Koch foundations and $2.2m from the Mercer Family Foundation \u2013 has published commentary questioning the value of shutdowns. Brian Riedl, writing in the Manhattan Institute publication City Journal, called the shutdowns unsustainable, saying just a few months \u201cwill cost the government and the economy trillions of dollars\u201d. An ExxonMobil spokesman, Casey Norton, noted the company had not contributed to most of the groups in this story for years and said it was not pushing to lift stay-at-home orders. \u201cWe continually evaluate our memberships and participation in organizations, and we do not contribute to organizations if we are not actively involved,\u201d Norton said. \u201cAs for return to work, our focus right now is on ensuring the safety and health of our entire workforce and to do our part to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus in the community.\u201d The Daily Caller, a news organization that has received $3.5m through 2017 from Koch foundations through its non-profit, has run articles suggesting Democrats want to kill the economy to keep Trump from getting re-elected. \u201cThe mainstream media, which works for the Democrat party, wanted us shut down more, and for longer,\u201d said opinion contributor Ron Hart. Often, funding by the fossil fuel industry is less obvious and more difficult to follow. Bits and pieces of financial connections are revealed in regulatory and court filings, but many are hidden behind dark money groups. One shutdown critic, author Alex Epstein, runs the for-profit thinktank the Center for Industrial Progress. Epstein has said his clients include the president of the Kentucky Coal Association and thecoaltruth.com, a project DeSmog links to employees of Alliance Coal. Epstein in a podcast compared the coronavirus to the seasonal flu and said \u201cthe purpose of the government is not to extend people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s to leave us free to live our lives as we judge best.\u201d Epstein told the Guardian his clients pay him \u201csolely to advise them on *their* messaging\u201d, and that \u201cnone of them have any influence on what I say publicly, on this or any other issue\u201d. Other critics of reopening are connected with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the American Council for Capital Formation and the Heartland Institute. Chris Horner, a former fellow at CEI, in an op-ed in the Washington Times in March warned that \u201cthe current \u2018coronavirus economy\u2019 could become legally mandated, with no recovery permitted but only worsening, in the name of climate change\u201d. Horner received funding from the coal company Alpha Natural Resources, according to a bankruptcy filing. Joel Zinberg, of CEI, and Richard Rahn \u2013 who is chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth and board member of ACCF \u2013 have also criticized stay-at-home orders. Rahn has called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese Communist party virus\u201d. CEI received $2.1m from ExxonMobil through 2005 and has taken $200,000 from Murray Energy more recently. ACCF has gotten $1.8m from ExxonMobil through 2015 and $600,000 from Koch groups through 2015. ACCF as an organization \u201chas taken no position on the stay-at-home orders or any prospective timeline for reopening the economy\u201d, said the group\u2019s CEO, Mark Bloomfield. The Heartland Institute, which denies the severity of anthropogenic climate change, has received $6.7m through 2017 from the Mercer Family Foundation, as well as $130,000 from coal company Murray Energy. The group received $25,000 from a Koch foundation for one specific project and got money from ExxonMobil until 2006. A Heartland spokesman, Jim Lakely, has argued \u201cleftists\u201d are \u201cstoking Covid-19 panic\u201d and has called lockdown orders unconstitutional. \u201cWhat\u2019s the time limit on being labeled \u2018Koch-funded\u2019 or \u2018Exxon-funded\u2019? A decade? Two? Also, who cares?\u201d Lakely said. He did not respond to questions about Mercer funding.",

Now, government plans to redevelop Delhi\u2019s emblematic central vista and build a new parliament have drawn fierce criticism.

The \u201cexpensive vanity project\u201d, Kapoor writes, is Modi\u2019s \u201cway of placing himself at the centre and cementing his legacy as the ruler-maker-builder of a new Hindu India\u201d.

      "bodyText": "EasyJet is to resume flights on a small number of routes from 15 June, with increased on-board safety measures including mandatory wearing of face masks, as it returns to the skies after grounding its fleet on 30 March. The airline will restart domestic routes in the UK and France initially, along with flights from four destinations elsewhere in Europe, where it says there is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying. Further routes will be added in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe. The airline will resume flights from airports in the UK, including London Gatwick, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Belfast International. It will also begin flying again from locations in France, including Paris Charles de Gaulle, Nice and Lyon, as well as Geneva in Switzerland, Lisbon and Porto in Portugal, and Barcelona in Spain. One confirmed international route will be Gatwick to Nice on the French Riviera. The carrier will introduce enhanced cleaning and disinfection of its aircraft, make disinfectant wipes and hand sanitiser available on board, and require all passengers and cabin crew, as well as ground crew, to wear masks. There will be no food service onboard initially. European authorities have released new guidelines to ensure the safety of passengers as regular flight schedules resume in the region after the coronavirus crisis shut down the majority of air traffic. The measures recommended by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control include the wearing of face masks at all times on the plane and at the airport, handwashing and observing physical distancing where possible. The organisations say passengers do not need to worry about the air quality because \u201cfiltered air on aeroplanes is safer and cleaner than many of us breathe on the ground\u201d. EasyJet will, however, not block the middle seats in its planes despite saying last month it was considering such a move. It says the measures \u201chave been implemented in consultation with aviation authorities\u201d and in line with government and medical advice. EasyJet also calculated that blocking middle seats might make flights unprofitable at a time when airlines are under financial pressure. The idea had previously been dismissed by Michael O\u2019Leary, the chief executive of its main rival Ryanair, who said it would be a \u201chopelessly ineffective\u201d way to keep passengers safe. Ryanair has also announced that it is resuming flights. The Irish carrier intends to restart 40% of its flights in July, almost 1,000 a day, but with only half the number of passengers between July and September than previously forecast. EasyJet\u2019s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline was taking \u201csmall and carefully planned steps\u201d to gradually resume operations. \u201cWe will continue to closely monitor the situation across Europe so, when more restrictions are lifted, the schedule will continue to build over time to match demand, while also ensuring we are operating efficiently and on routes that our customers want,\u201d he said. EasyJet\u2019s announcement comes days after the airline revealed the personal data of 9 million customers, including email addresses and travel details, had been accessed in a cyber-attack. Of those affected, 2,208 had their credit card information stolen, although no passport details were uncovered. The company has already contacted customers whose card details were taken, while everyone else affected will be contacted by 26 May. The breach is one of the largest to affect any company in the UK, and raises the possibility of easyJet paying a large fine. EasyJet also faces a crunch investor meeting on Friday when its 34% shareholder and founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, brings forward a vote to oust four of the airline\u2019s directors, including Lundgren, the chairman, John Barton, and the airline\u2019s finance director, Andrew Findlay. Haji-Ioannou has argued that an order for 107 aircraft from Airbus endangered the survival of the carrier he launched from Luton airport in 1995.",

After April\u2019s unprecedented economic slump as lockdown measures brought the UK economy to an effective standstill, the latest monthly health check for growth and jobs from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) suggested the economy has recovered slightly this month. Its flash composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2013 which provides a snapshot of business activity using company surveys \u2013 rose to 28.9 this month from a record low of 13.8 in April. However, that is still far below the 50.0 mark that separates economic growth from contraction. The reading was also worse than the lowest point of the 2008 financial crisis. The survey shows Britain remains firmly locked in an unprecedented downturn, with sharply lower levels of activity. Many businesses have remained closed during the Covid-19 outbreak, while others have suffered cancelled customer orders and a general slump in demand. Separate figures published by the Confederation of British Industry showed that manufacturing output dropped at the fastest rate since comparable records began in 1975 during the three months to May. According to a survey of 385 manufacturers by the industry lobby group, production plunged in 15 out of 17 sectors. The steepest declines were at car factories and sites producing food, drink and tobacco. Export orders for UK factories collapsed at the fastest rate since 1998. Sounding the alarm that the pace of recovery would be muted, companies told the survey they expected production to fall at a slightly slower \u2013 but still rapid, in historical terms \u2013 pace in the next three months. Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI, said manufacturers are \u201cbracing for what will be a challenging period\u201d. She urged the government to show flexibility in the support it was offering so that \u201cthe manufacturing sector can exit the lockdown with as little permanent damage possible\u201d. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said Britain appeared to be reopening more slowly than other countries due to the scale of the public health emergency compared with other nations. Warning that business confidence was struggling to recover, and with Brexit just around the corner, he said: \u201cThe UK looks set to see a frustratingly slow recovery, given the likely slower pace of opening up the economy relative to other countries which have seen fewer Covid-19 cases. \u201cVirus-related restrictions, widespread job insecurity and weak demand will be exacerbated by growing business uncertainty regarding Brexit.\u201d The figures come after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, played down hopes for a rapid economic rebound from the coronavirus crisis. The government had been hoping for a sharp V-shaped recovery from the pandemic, but the chancellor said the \u201cjury is out\u201d on the \u201cdegree of long-term scarring\u201d on the UK economy. IHS Markit forecasts GDP to fall by almost 12% in 2020. \u201cThe recovery will be measured in years, not months,\u201d Williamson said. Figures from the eurozone earlier on Thursday suggested business activity in the single currency bloc was slightly stronger than in Britain. The eurozone composite PMI increased to 30.5 in May from a record low of 13.6 in April. In a reflection of the gradual lifting of lockdown measures, separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed 6% of businesses currently open for business had restarted trading in the two weeks to 3 May. Almost four-fifths of firms across the country are still trading, although the vast majority are using emergency state support. According to the ONS, the sector of the economy that includes hotels, restaurants and takeaways reported the largest percentage of firms restarting trading over the period, followed by construction and manufacturing.",

I sweat in it \u2013 mopping floors, disinfecting surfaces, cleaning everything that might be touched by a hand. I am aware that if I miss a spot, the virus might stay on the surface, and someone might die. At the end of the day I return home to my partner, exhausted \u2013 emotionally, as much as physically \u2013 put moisturiser on my hands, which are cracked and dry from the cleaning products, and fall asleep.</p> \n<p>This is my daily routine now. Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was a photographer and film-maker. But when the impact of Covid-19 started to become clear, I put that work on hold and looked for a more immediate way to help my community. I saw my local hospital, Whipps Cross, was looking for cleaners. I applied, was interviewed and trained, and began work there that same week.</p> \n<p>Yesterday, while scrolling through my phone on the walk into work, I saw <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-nhs-cleaners-leave-to-remain-scheme-home-office-a9523111.html\">an article that read</a>: \u201cNHS porters, cleaners and social care staff have been left out of a Home Office scheme granting families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if they die of coronavirus\u201d. It felt like I\u2019d been slapped across the face. My partner and I are both Syrian. To know that, should the worst happen to me, she would not be granted indefinite leave to remain, was indescribably hurtful. I also thought of my colleagues and their families, all of whom are incredibly important to me. While I\u2019ve done this job for just under two months, most of them have been doing it for years, if not decades. They are from all over the world: Spain, Ghana, Poland, Nigeria, Italy, the Caribbean, India. Their expertise and dedication inspires me every day.</p> \n<p>During my lunch break, I sat in my car and, out of desperation, filmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hassan_akkad/status/1263081676890148864\">a plea to our prime minister</a>. I told him that although \u201cI\u2019ve been really enjoying the clapping that you and your fellow ministers in the government do every week, today, however, I felt betrayed, stabbed in the back.\u201d I posted it on Twitter, and within a few hours it had nearly a million views. Thousands were resharing it, voicing their solidarity with, and admiration for, the people who turn up each day at their frontline jobs and risk their lives to keep the country running.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"789aa69b-6164-468e-aa83-a6f823567551\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XkwnN2wPy1w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then something happened. Five hours after I posted my initial tweet, the home secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1263153647791284224?s=20\">announced</a> a U-turn: the bereavement scheme was to be expanded to include all NHS support staff and their families, effective immediately and retrospectively. This action was a result of the work of pressure from unions and politicians, as well as everyone who spoke out.</p> \n<p>I am moved by the countless responses to my video from members of the public who are passionate about ensuring every worker and their family has access to an equal level of protection. This is bigger than the scheme being expanded to include NHS support staff. This is a demonstration that the country has the ability to change. To use our experiences of the pandemic to care more deeply for one another, and to take the concrete actions needed to improve the lives of both migrant workers and other marginalised communities through the UK.</p> \n<p>There is still a lot of work to do. To only include support staff in the scheme following a public outcry is not enough \u2013 the government must do more to protect key workers. Health workers are still dying on the frontline, with the recorded total \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">nearly 200 at the time of writing</a> \u2013 now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/fields-of-operation/iraq\">exceeding the number</a> (179) of British military personnel who died in the Iraq war. A disproportionate number of BAME staff have died, and we know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">minority groups are overrepresented</a> by up to 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll.</p> \n<p>In addition to these risks, we know that there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/foreign-nhs-workers-coronavirus-frontline-nhs-surcharge\">153,000 non-British nationals working for the NHS</a>, who will be taxed double to access health services because of their immigration status \u2013 once through income tax and then through the immigration health surcharge. We want to support the NHS, but also to be able to use it in our own times of need without prohibitive costs stopping us.</p> \n<p>I will continue to use my platform as much as possible, to open spaces for discussion on how we can create a more fair, inclusive, and kind society that recognises the contributions those from all over the world make not just to the NHS, but to our country as a whole.

There are hoodies by the cult streetwear brand Bathing Ape and Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White; outfits nodding to well-loved names in the fashion industry such as Sacai and Jacquemus; and even signature wet-look tops inspired by the cult designer of sexy menswear, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/27/oh-my-goodness-from-jockstraps-to-codpieces-how-menswear-got-sexy\">Ludovic de Saint Sernin</a>, and the now infamous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-3RjUgHTsT/\">\u201cFuck Boris\u201d design</a> the Tottenham-based bootleg label Sports Banger.</p> <p>A number of experienced creators are fuelling the game\u2019s high-fashion credentials. Richmond Young is a web developer who has been giving players the chance to wear cutting-edge looks from Bottega Veneta, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton and Gucci via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/crossingtherunway/?hl=en\">Crossing the Runway</a>, an Instagram account dedicated to the fashion of Animal Crossing. \u201cPeople plug a serial number into their game, the garment arrives in their closet, and they can wear it immediately,\u201d he explains</p> <p>It isn\u2019t the first time fashion has crossed over into video games \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/08/240397/jeremy-scott-moschino-the-sims\">Moschino\u2019s Jeremy Scott designed clothes for EA\u2019s simulation game The Sims</a>, while <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/digital/want-nikes-latest-jordans-theyre-only-fortnite/2173436\">Nike has collaborated with Fortnite</a> on a digital version of the brand\u2019s iconic Air Jordan trainer.

The looks range \u201cfrom cute to traditional, or madcap to understated, so you can walk about in a frog hat and a pair of orange leggings or put together a blazer-and-chinos smart-casual combo.\u201d</p> <p>Shel Orock, an industrial designer and co-founder of Crossing the Runway, thinks the appeal is similar to Instagram\u2019s #OOTD: \u201cA lot of people can\u2019t go outside and flex their outfit and show it off, and this has been our way of playing into that.\u201d</p> <p>In this world, unlike the real one, designer threads come free. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to live out fashion fantasies without having to pay the steep price,\u201d says Michele Yue, one of the founders of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nookstreetmarket/?hl=en\">Nook Street Market</a> (NSM) on Instagram, a play on the famous Dover Street Market, whose 23k+ followers are treated to looks from Molly Goddard to YSL.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAGNKM-FxNI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We like to take it as a form of honour and flattery.\u201d Fellow New York brand <a href=\"https://vaquera.nyc/\">Vaquera</a>, whose designs also show up on avatars from time to time, sees it similarly: \u201cIt\u2019s been really inspiring to see how people are using Animal Crossing to live out fantasies, whether it be with clothes, gardening or a dream home.\u201d While none of them has a Nintendo Switch and so haven\u2019t been able to play, \u201cwe\u2019re dying to create our own Vaquera Island\u201d.</p> <p>Despite no real-life money changing hands, there are non-digital rewards for brands, and many seem to enjoy the exposure. Plus, as Dominic Lopezone, co-founder of the streetwear brand Happy99, told <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/nintendo-animal-crossing-custom-clothes-fashion\">industry website Business of Fashion</a> off the back of a 30% increase after releasing a collection on the game: \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good attachment between owning a hoodie in a game and then later deciding to buy the hoodie so that you match your avatar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_7xdV0DTmh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Nintendo\u2019s Animal Crossing, the best-selling game of the coronavirus pandemic, has become an unlikely outlet for fashion fans in lockdown. Avatars have been wearing bootleg creations inspired by Prada, Gucci, Chanel and Thierry Mugler catwalk looks or created specifically for the virtual world by designers including Marc Jacobs, who has created a six-strong collection for the game, and Valentino. There are various ways to attain new clothes in this soothing cyber society in which players can pick fruit and make friends with anthropomorphised animals. The Able Sisters, a tailor shop in the game that is run by two hedgehogs, has become as talked about in some quarters as Harvey Nichols. Here players can \u201cbuy\u201d anything from pleather masks to neon tights using the game\u2019s currency of bells. But players are not limited to preset Nintendo designs \u2013 the ability to create custom designs has led to a host of riffs on high fashion and streetwear looks. There are hoodies by the cult streetwear brand Bathing Ape and Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White; outfits nodding to well-loved names in the fashion industry such as Sacai and Jacquemus; and even signature wet-look tops inspired by the cult designer of sexy menswear, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, and the now infamous \u201cFuck Boris\u201d design the Tottenham-based bootleg label Sports Banger. A number of experienced creators are fuelling the game\u2019s high-fashion credentials. Richmond Young is a web developer who has been giving players the chance to wear cutting-edge looks from Bottega Veneta, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton and Gucci via Crossing the Runway, an Instagram account dedicated to the fashion of Animal Crossing. \u201cPeople plug a serial number into their game, the garment arrives in their closet, and they can wear it immediately,\u201d he explains It isn\u2019t the first time fashion has crossed over into video games \u2013 Moschino\u2019s Jeremy Scott designed clothes for EA\u2019s simulation game The Sims, while Nike has collaborated with Fortnite on a digital version of the brand\u2019s iconic Air Jordan trainer. But it plays a unique role in Animal Crossing because, says the Guardian\u2019s video games editor, Keza MacDonald, \u201cit\u2019s a game about self-expression\u201d, \u201cPlenty of games let you pick an outfit, but Animal Crossing lets you pick all the elements of an outfit, from socks and hats and shoes to dresses, turn-ups, shorts, parkas \u2026 that makes an Animal Crossing outfit feel unique,\u201d she says. The looks range \u201cfrom cute to traditional, or madcap to understated, so you can walk about in a frog hat and a pair of orange leggings or put together a blazer-and-chinos smart-casual combo.\u201d Shel Orock, an industrial designer and co-founder of Crossing the Runway, thinks the appeal is similar to Instagram\u2019s #OOTD: \u201cA lot of people can\u2019t go outside and flex their outfit and show it off, and this has been our way of playing into that.\u201d In this world, unlike the real one, designer threads come free. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to live out fashion fantasies without having to pay the steep price,\u201d says Michele Yue, one of the founders of Nook Street Market (NSM) on Instagram, a play on the famous Dover Street Market, whose 23k+ followers are treated to looks from Molly Goddard to YSL. While some brands may be unhappy about having their designs riffed on, in the experience of Vivian Loh, another NSM founder, \u201cdesigners and their teams are often very receptive.\u201d Orock has had similar reactions: \u201cJW Anderson\u2019s social media recently featured our work in their Instagram story.\u201d According to the New York City-based label Barrag\u00e1n, whose clothes have appeared in the game: \u201cWe were absolutely thrilled when gamers started to tag and DM us showing off their creations. We like to take it as a form of honour and flattery.\u201d Fellow New York brand Vaquera, whose designs also show up on avatars from time to time, sees it similarly: \u201cIt\u2019s been really inspiring to see how people are using Animal Crossing to live out fantasies, whether it be with clothes, gardening or a dream home.\u201d While none of them has a Nintendo Switch and so haven\u2019t been able to play, \u201cwe\u2019re dying to create our own Vaquera Island\u201d. Despite no real-life money changing hands, there are non-digital rewards for brands, and many seem to enjoy the exposure. Plus, as Dominic Lopezone, co-founder of the streetwear brand Happy99, told industry website Business of Fashion off the back of a 30% increase after releasing a collection on the game: \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good attachment between owning a hoodie in a game and then later deciding to buy the hoodie so that you match your avatar.\u201d This peak in interest for digital fashion comes at a time when the pandemic has increasingly been forcing the industry, from fashion weeks to photoshoots, online. The world\u2019s first entirely virtual fashion week took place in Shanghai in March, with Russia fashion week following suit and London fashion week men\u2019s showcase in June being planned as a digital event. In this context, Animal Crossing is helping open up the conversations around the shape of fashion in the future, thinks Young. \u201cWe as consumers need to see this as adapting to a new way to shop, a new way to dress up \u2013 and the fashion companies can see this as a new way that people can get into fashion.\u201d",

Europe warned about second wave of coronavirus infections Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite pandemic Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier cancelling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When the coronavirus struck, the British government repeatedly said it was among the best-prepared countries in the world \u2013 with some justification. As recently as October, an <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2019-Global-Health-Security-Index.pdf\">international review </a>of pandemic planning ranked the UK the second best prepared country in the world (behind the US). </p> \n<p>Two months on, any breezy confidence has evaporated. The government is facing growing complaints over a series of policy missteps that critics say are responsible for the worst death toll in Europe. </p> \n<p>How did a country that supposedly had one of the best pandemic plans in the world end up suffering one of the worst outbreaks? </p> \n<p>A review of official documents and interviews with politicians, national security advisers and experts in risk management suggests one answer may be that ministers stuck closely to the recommendations of a well-honed plan for a different disease: the flu.</p> \n<p>The origin of the UK\u2019s strategy for a catastrophic influenza pandemic was a tractor blockade at a Cheshire oil refinery in September 2000. Several dozen farmers, angry about the cost of fuel, blockaded the Stanlow oil refinery and refused to leave until the Labour government agreed to a reduction in duty.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d231d924e0259c86d1b175293dc68384f968eb75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d231d924e0259c86d1b175293dc68384f968eb75/0_37_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmers with a tractor blockade the Stanlow oil refinery in 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2000 refinery blockade led civil servants to fear that civil emergencies could bring down a country.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The blockade began on a Friday. By Wednesday, the UK was on the brink of collapse. Copycat groups <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/921903.stm\">obstructed other fuel depots</a>. Enormous tailbacks of panic-buying motorists stretched out of petrol stations and down motorways. Fire engines and ambulances were days away from running dry, and NHS trusts faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/14/tonyblair.oil\">cancelling elective surgeries</a>. One supermarket started rationing.</p> \n<p>The protests ended and ministers later agreed to freeze fuel duty. But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,\u201d said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThe shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.\u201d</p> \n<p>Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair\u2019s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation.</p> \n<p>The ambition was \u201cto create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run\u201d, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups.</p> \n<p>Mann\u2019s unit dealt with a \u201crelentless\u201d series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings.</p> \n<p>But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list \u2013 then and now \u2013 was an influenza pandemic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/the-wrong-kind-of-government-to-deal-with-a-pandemic\">The wrong kind of government to deal with a pandemic | Letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. \u201cIn addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61934/national_risk_register.pdf\">stated the 2008 register</a>. \u201cNormal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.\u201d Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cPandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,\u201d said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. \u201cEverybody had been expecting something to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,\u201d he added, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">the 1918 flu pandemic</a> that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide.</p> \n<p>Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK\u2019s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the \u201cfairly skeletal\u201d existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources.

      "bodyText": "When the coronavirus struck, the British government repeatedly said it was among the best-prepared countries in the world \u2013 with some justification. As recently as October, an international review of pandemic planning ranked the UK the second best prepared country in the world (behind the US). Two months on, any breezy confidence has evaporated. The government is facing growing complaints over a series of policy missteps that critics say are responsible for the worst death toll in Europe. How did a country that supposedly had one of the best pandemic plans in the world end up suffering one of the worst outbreaks? A review of official documents and interviews with politicians, national security advisers and experts in risk management suggests one answer may be that ministers stuck closely to the recommendations of a well-honed plan for a different disease: the flu. The origin of the UK\u2019s strategy for a catastrophic influenza pandemic was a tractor blockade at a Cheshire oil refinery in September 2000. Several dozen farmers, angry about the cost of fuel, blockaded the Stanlow oil refinery and refused to leave until the Labour government agreed to a reduction in duty. The blockade began on a Friday. By Wednesday, the UK was on the brink of collapse. Copycat groups obstructed other fuel depots. Enormous tailbacks of panic-buying motorists stretched out of petrol stations and down motorways. Fire engines and ambulances were days away from running dry, and NHS trusts faced cancelling elective surgeries. One supermarket started rationing. The protests ended and ministers later agreed to freeze fuel duty. But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country. \u201cFor a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,\u201d said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThe shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.\u201d Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair\u2019s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation. The ambition was \u201cto create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run\u201d, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups. Mann\u2019s unit dealt with a \u201crelentless\u201d series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings. But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list \u2013 then and now \u2013 was an influenza pandemic. Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. \u201cIn addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,\u201d stated the 2008 register. \u201cNormal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.\u201d Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000. \u201cPandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,\u201d said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. \u201cEverybody had been expecting something to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,\u201d he added, referring to the 1918 flu pandemic that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide. Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK\u2019s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the \u201cfairly skeletal\u201d existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources. To get them, she would need to force ministers to realise the potential scale of a pandemic crisis. Together with Mann she coordinated the first major nationwide simulation of a flu pandemic in 2007, codenamed Winter Willow. One question surrounding the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus is whether it implemented recommendations from a second, 2016 flu pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. The report, which was leaked to the Guardian, made several recommendations that appear to have been overlooked. But Winter Willow was the far larger exercise. Where Cygnus involved 950 people, Winter Willow marshalled more than 5,000 people, including government ministers, civil servants, emergency planners, NHS staff, and emergency services personnel to coordinate the first real attempt to test how the UK would hold up under the strain of a pandemic. The result was transformative. \u201cThat was absolutely a turning point for us, because people at that stage realised what [a flu pandemic] could do,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exaggerate it at all; if anything we underplayed it. We had a sort of moderate pandemic scenario, rather than the worst-case one. But even then,\u201d she added, \u201cwe ran out of face masks.\u201d As well as pinpointing holes in the planning, Winter Willow galvanised ministers into taking the threat of a pandemic seriously. \u201cMinisters, when they were faced with the reality of it, suddenly realised that this actually could be disastrous,\u201d Davies added. Several changes of government later, and after a decade of austerity, pandemic planning appears to have slowly dropped off the radar. The value of the UK\u2019s pandemic influenza stockpile, estimated at \u00a3831m in 2013, declined by 40% over six years. Ricketts says that while the government had a faultless record anticipating pandemic influenza as a risk, \u201csomewhere along the line that didn\u2019t get translated into decisions on funding, preparedness stocks, the in-case stocks of vital equipment to make it real\u201d. But a second consensus has also emerged: that one of the UK\u2019s big mistakes, rather than failing to plan, was planning for the wrong illness. Whole tracts of the UK\u2019s comprehensive pandemic strategy turn upon any pandemic being flu \u2013 a different type of disease to a coronavirus. The emergency pandemic stockpile contains millions of doses of Tamiflu and Relenza to help alleviate the worst of the symptoms for anyone catching the new flu disease, and a National Flu Pandemic Service would distribute them. Stockpiles of existing flu vaccines that might be effective against the new strain would be distributed to inoculate health workers, while contingency contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be spun up to manufacture more flu drugs. The government\u2019s most recent national security risk assessment, compiled last year, predicted a potential catastrophe in the event of a flu pandemic: trillions of pounds in damages, deaths in the five figures, disruption lasting for months. However, the risk assessment\u2019s prediction for the potential impact of a new disease like a coronavirus was staggeringly off target. The worst-case scenario for a novel infectious disease in the UK, the government\u2019s risk assessment said, \u201ccould be on the scale of the Sars outbreak in Toronto, Canada\u201d, which involved 438 probable and suspected cases and 44 deaths. Economic damage would be limited to a few billion pounds, mostly from nervous tourists staying away. The British government\u2019s focus on flu, and the failure to look at how Asian countries were responding to the coronavirus, was recently described by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt as \u201cone of the biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes\u201d. \u201cIt is now clear that a major blind spot in the approach taken in Europe and America was our focus on pandemic flu rather than pandemic coronaviruses, such as Sars or Mers,\u201d he told parliament. The extent to which Boris Johnson\u2019s government stuck to a protocol laid out in its flu pandemic plans is made clear by reviewing the 2011 strategy for responding to a flu pandemic (the most recent published version available). It reads like an extraordinarily precise description of the steps the UK government did (and did not) take in its initial response to Covid-19. Mass gatherings such as football matches and live music events would continue, in part to \u201chelp maintain public morale\u201d. There would be no quarantining of international arrivals at airports, though passengers would be encouraged to report any symptoms upon arrival. Face masks would not be recommended for use by the public. There is no mention whatsoever of healthy people being confined to their homes in an attempt to prevent transmission. Perhaps most striking is that the decision to wind down contact tracing on 12 March, widely viewed as an error that has hamstrung the UK\u2019s ability to fight back against the coronavirus, is also alluded to in the government\u2019s flu pandemic strategy.

It even anticipates that detection and assessment could itself be a \u201crelatively short\u201d phase, depending on the circumstances. The flu strategy bluntly concludes: \u201cIt will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so.\u201d There is one obvious but important reason why the UK may have focused its attention so much on planning for influenza: following Spanish flu in 1918, subsequent pandemics included Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1967, and swine flu in 2009.

      "body": "<p>Doctors and activists in Dagestan have described the death toll in the Russian region as \u201ctragically high\u201d, after officials said more than 600 people had died from pneumonia since April \u2013 far more than the official Covid-19 death toll for the region of 36.</p> <p>\u201cIn some towns, five to seven people were dying a day \u2026 some have seen 20 or 40 people die,\u201d said Ziyatdin Uvaisov, the head of Patient Monitor, a Dagestani NGO that advocates for the rights of patients and medics and has canvassed for information about coronavirus deaths.</p> <p>At least six doctors have died at a single hospital in the closed-off city of Khasavyurt. Patimat, a doctor in the cardiology department there, told the Guardian that a majority of the doctors had contracted coronavirus, including herself, and a \u201cconsiderable number\u201d had died or at one point been too sick to work.

      "bodyText": "Doctors and activists in Dagestan have described the death toll in the Russian region as \u201ctragically high\u201d, after officials said more than 600 people had died from pneumonia since April \u2013 far more than the official Covid-19 death toll for the region of 36. \u201cIn some towns, five to seven people were dying a day \u2026 some have seen 20 or 40 people die,\u201d said Ziyatdin Uvaisov, the head of Patient Monitor, a Dagestani NGO that advocates for the rights of patients and medics and has canvassed for information about coronavirus deaths. At least six doctors have died at a single hospital in the closed-off city of Khasavyurt. Patimat, a doctor in the cardiology department there, told the Guardian that a majority of the doctors had contracted coronavirus, including herself, and a \u201cconsiderable number\u201d had died or at one point been too sick to work. Another doctor said seven health workers had died at the hospital. Patimat said her first wave of patients fell ill after attending a funeral for another person who had died from coronavirus. \u201cPeople went in crowds to their funerals,\u201d she said. \u201cMy main wave of patients early in the epidemic told me they had been there.\u201d At the height of the crisis, Patimat said, her department ran out of oxygen to treat all the patients and could not get test results to confirm coronavirus diagnoses. She said most of the samples sent for analysis were either returned or scrapped. \u201cThere was a colossal shortage of medicines and equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never expected waves [of patients] like this.\u201d Earlier this month Daniyal Alkhasov, another doctor who had volunteered at the hospital, said he had fallen ill with coronavirus after two shifts there. At least two doctors who died at the hospital were later reported to have died from \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia\u201d. The lack of coronavirus testing and frequent opposition from family members to autopsies has meant the official death toll from Covid-19 in Dagestan is far lower than the toll of deaths attributed to other diseases such as pneumonia. Officials say there may also be unreported deaths in isolated villages and towns that still have not been canvassed. The scale of the pandemic in the region was confirmed publicly on Sunday when Dagestan\u2019s health minister, Djamaludin Gadzhiibragimov, said during an interview with a local blogger that in addition to 29 official Covid-19 deaths, 659 people had died of pneumonia and another 7,000 were in hospital. He said 40 health workers had died since the beginning of the crisis (officials say they did not all die from coronavirus). After pleas from senior officials and clerics, Vladimir Putin intervened personally this week, pledging aid from federal agencies during a nationally televised conference. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s most famous son, the MMA fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov, issued a call on Instagram for adherence to lockdown measures. His father has contracted coronavirus and is reportedly in a medically induced coma in a Moscow hospital after being airlifted from Dagestan. \u201cHospitals are overflowing, many people have been sick, and very many people have died,\u201d Nurmagomedov told his 20 million followers online. Officials have blamed distrust of local authorities and lockdown violations for the severe outbreak, noting that mass events such as weddings, funerals and religious celebrations sped the spread of the disease. Putin has called on people in Dagestan \u2013 a majority Muslim region of 3 million people in the North Caucasus \u2013 to celebrate the end of Ramadan at home. Doctors and paramedics in three areas of Dagestan said they had been undersupplied with medical and personal protective equipment, a situation that had only begun to stabilise in recent days. \u201cThe hospital system was totally unprepared,\u201d said Uvaisov, whose NGO has raised funds to buy and deliver medics masks and other basic PPE. Dagestan is not the only region where deaths attributed to pneumonia have far outpaced official coronavirus deaths. This month the St Petersburg governor said at least 694 people had died of pneumonia since March \u2013 10 times more than the official number of dead from coronavirus at the time.

Belfast city hall has allowed the Chinese consulate to build a security barrier around its headquarters in the affluent Malone area, claiming that Chinese officials have diplomatic immunity from the region\u2019s strict planning laws. But those living in the upmarket Malone ParkAdelaide Park district have obtained a letter from Northern Ireland\u2019s attorney general assuring them that there is no such immunity for building on land sited within a conservation zone. Residents angry about the council\u2019s decision to ignore normal planning application rules have alleged it is motivated by a desire to entice Chinese economic investment into Northern Ireland at any price. Construction to fortify the exterior wall of the Chinese consulate, which opened five years ago in south Belfast, began in February. Builders were flown in from China to erect the barrier and they have worked at the site throughout the coronavirus crisis. The work has continued even though Chinese diplomats did not apply for permission for the project through the normal planning procedures. In a letter to Martin McBurney, who lives across the road from the consulate, a Belfast city council official said the Chinese had the right to build the wall under the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations \u2013 the international act of law that grants immunity to diplomats in foreign countries. \u201cIn relation to your query regarding diplomatic immunity, the consulate has consistently asserted that their premises are inviolable by virtue of the fact that the premises have been designated as consulate premises by the secretary of state,\u201d the council letter states.

In a letter from the office of the attorney general, John Larkin QC, Northern Ireland\u2019s most senior law officer said the Vienna convention \u201cdoes not exempt such premises from the requirements of domestic planning law\u201d. The office advised the city council that it was its duty \u201cto consider properly the full extent of its own powers and duties in this area\u201d. It noted that if the Chinese consulate refused to comply with any enforcement notice the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may have to intervene. \u201cThere is no bar in international or domestic law to an enforcement notice being issued against the consulate,\u201d it said.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/04/gini-index-is-a-poor-inequality-measure\">Gini coefficient</a> is measured between 0 and 100 \u2013 with 0 indicating that income is shared equally among all people and rising to 100 in extreme income inequality.<strong> </strong>The story was that the rich also took a beating in this long period of austerity imposed by successive Tory governments \u2013 and they didn\u2019t get richer.</p> <p>Now we have proof that this tale isn\u2019t true. <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/who-gains/\">Who gains?</a>, a report by the Resolution Foundation released on Thursday, with researchers from the LSE and Warwick University, has found missing billions in earnings of the hyper-rich, all disguised as capital gains \u2013 profits from selling an asset for more than it was worth when it was acquired. The share of earnings of the top 1% were far greater and grew far faster than previously disclosed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/rates\">Capital gains</a> are taxed at just 20%, unlike the 45% income tax rate for top earners. With a deft sleight of hand, wealthy individuals and business managers<strong> </strong>can take large amounts of their earnings in the form of shares or other assets to avoid it being taxed as income. Andy Summers of the London School of Economics says the line between the two taxes is \u201cvery blurred\u201d.</p> <p>The missing sum of money is enormous \u2013 the scale of the switch into capital gains vast. Taxable capital gains in the UK more than doubled between 2012-13 and 2017-18, jumping to \u00a355bn.

      "bodyText": "Ever since 2010, the government has claimed we have been \u201call in this together\u201d during the lost decade of austerity. Rich and poor alike are taking a hit; that was what they told us. When anyone complains of \u201crising inequality\u201d \u2013 because that\u2019s how it feels for so many people \u2013 the Tories and their commentariat brandish official statistics showing it\u2019s not so. The dial on the Gini coefficient hasn\u2019t shifted for years, they claim. The Gini coefficient is measured between 0 and 100 \u2013 with 0 indicating that income is shared equally among all people and rising to 100 in extreme income inequality. The story was that the rich also took a beating in this long period of austerity imposed by successive Tory governments \u2013 and they didn\u2019t get richer. Now we have proof that this tale isn\u2019t true. Who gains?, a report by the Resolution Foundation released on Thursday, with researchers from the LSE and Warwick University, has found missing billions in earnings of the hyper-rich, all disguised as capital gains \u2013 profits from selling an asset for more than it was worth when it was acquired. The share of earnings of the top 1% were far greater and grew far faster than previously disclosed. Capital gains are taxed at just 20%, unlike the 45% income tax rate for top earners. With a deft sleight of hand, wealthy individuals and business managers can take large amounts of their earnings in the form of shares or other assets to avoid it being taxed as income. Andy Summers of the London School of Economics says the line between the two taxes is \u201cvery blurred\u201d. The missing sum of money is enormous \u2013 the scale of the switch into capital gains vast. Taxable capital gains in the UK more than doubled between 2012-13 and 2017-18, jumping to \u00a355bn. The top 1% are far richer than we thought, while the earnings of the top 0.1% have grown 50% more from 1996 to 2018 than previously measured. \u201cA lot of capital gains are, in fact, just repackaged income going to the already-rich,\u201d says Summers.

On Thursday, News UK, the owner of the Sun and the Times and Sunday Times, became the latest publisher to stop having the print circulation of its titles made public. \u201cWhile print remains a vitally important method of distributing our editorial to readers and meeting our advertisers\u2019 needs, it is logical that the way we measure our audiences reflects the way the world works today,\u201d said David Dinsmore, chief operating officer at News UK. Telegraph Media Group, the publisher of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, pulled out of ABC at the start of the year and publishes its own independently audited figures.",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Since mid-March, the World Health Organization has urged countries to scale up the testing, isolation and contact tracing of Covid-19 patients in order to combat the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "A group of families of people who died from Covid-19 have called for an immediate public inquiry into the UK\u2019s coronavirus response, saying there is evidence the government is already trying to cover up its failings. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, a Facebook group with more than 200 members, was founded by Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died on 13 April, and Jo Goodman, whose father, Stuart, 72, died on 2 April. Fowler said the group was calling for swift inquiry into the response to the pandemic so far to stop the government from continuing to make the same mistakes. He believes the failure to impose a lockdown before 23 March caused avoidable deaths. \u201cThis is such a traumatic way to lose someone,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cPeople have become numb to seeing the numbers. All of these numbers are a life and a valued person. It is as if the people who have gone are insignificant. Every day families are joining us in mourning. These are not just numbers. These are lives and loved ones who are being taken too soon.\u201d Speaking at Wednesday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said there would be a time for lessons to be learned after the crisis, but insisted the public wanted the government to focus on tackling the virus. Ministers have been accused of attempting to blame the government\u2019s initial response to the pandemic on poor scientific advice. \u201cIf the science was wrong, if the advice at the time was wrong, I am not surprised if people think we made the wrong decision,\u201d said the work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, on Tuesday, though No 10 later distanced itself from her comments. More than 100,000 people have signed an e-petition, organised by the campaign group March for Change that calls for an urgent independent inquiry into the coronavirus response. The bereaved families group is being supported by Elkan Abrahamson, a human rights lawyer who represented 20 of the Hillsborough families in the recent inquest. \u201cAs someone who has been profoundly involved in a number of cases where the powerful have tried to hide their mistakes, I\u2019m becoming increasingly concerned by the government\u2019s apparent failure to accept responsibility for at least some of the 40,000 or more deaths caused to date by coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are already worrying signs that we are heading for another state cover-up, in that we are not seeing a full and transparent presentation of the facts surrounding some decisions.\u201d Abrahamson, who is head of major inquiries at the law firm Broudie Jackson Canter, pointed to the Coronavirus Act 2020, which removed the need for juries at inquests into coronavirus-related deaths and reminded coroners that Covid-19 fatalities were \u201cdeaths by natural causes\u201d so may not require an inquest at all. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore imperative to start a public inquiry now, both to allow for information to be gathered and to ensure the life and death decisions currently being taken by the government are scrutinised,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on Saturday 23 May 2020 to remove references to the British Medical Association supporting the families\u2019 call.",

      "body": "<p>A group of retired doctors who set up the UK\u2019s first Covid-19 contact-tracing scheme has warned that the government system faces major challenges after they struggled to persuade health and care workers to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>Dr Bing Jones, a retired Sheffield GP, helped start the group a month ago out of frustration that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">contact tracing had been abandoned</a> in England. \u201cWe sat down and thought: this is a major omission \u2013 a schoolboy error. We have got one of the biggest crises you can possibly imagine and one of the major building blocks of the public health management of an epidemic is not being done,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>They were surprised to find that most contacts of people with Covid-19 were workers from the NHS, care homes or care provider agencies \u2013 and that those people were not always happy to stop work and go into isolation for seven to 14 days. \u201cThe majority were in health and care settings. That\u2019s the really big and worrying message here,\u201d said Jones.</p> \n<p>The group set up <a href=\"https://www.communitycontacttracers.com/\">its pilot project in Sheffield</a>, using volunteers who called up people with Covid-19 referred to them by GPs. The volunteers offered support and asked for the names and numbers of anyone the patient had spent more than 15 minutes with in an enclosed space.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Their early report of what happened \u2013 with 13 people who had Covid-19 and 58 of their contacts \u2013 paints a worrying picture. People were unwilling to let them have details or the volunteers were unable to reach 39 of the 58. In 29 cases, those were care workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou talk to somebody and they will sometimes give you the names of their fellow cleaners or kitchen staff in a care home, but as soon as they start talking to each other they think, well we\u2019d better talk to our manager, and the manager says oh no \u2013 you\u2019d better not do this,\u201d said Jones.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd the fact is that in all of these care settings but also in the NHS, there is no culture for contact tracing.

      "bodyText": "A group of retired doctors who set up the UK\u2019s first Covid-19 contact-tracing scheme has warned that the government system faces major challenges after they struggled to persuade health and care workers to self-isolate. Dr Bing Jones, a retired Sheffield GP, helped start the group a month ago out of frustration that contact tracing had been abandoned in England. \u201cWe sat down and thought: this is a major omission \u2013 a schoolboy error. We have got one of the biggest crises you can possibly imagine and one of the major building blocks of the public health management of an epidemic is not being done,\u201d he said. They were surprised to find that most contacts of people with Covid-19 were workers from the NHS, care homes or care provider agencies \u2013 and that those people were not always happy to stop work and go into isolation for seven to 14 days. \u201cThe majority were in health and care settings. That\u2019s the really big and worrying message here,\u201d said Jones. The group set up its pilot project in Sheffield, using volunteers who called up people with Covid-19 referred to them by GPs. The volunteers offered support and asked for the names and numbers of anyone the patient had spent more than 15 minutes with in an enclosed space. Their early report of what happened \u2013 with 13 people who had Covid-19 and 58 of their contacts \u2013 paints a worrying picture. People were unwilling to let them have details or the volunteers were unable to reach 39 of the 58. In 29 cases, those were care workers. \u201cYou talk to somebody and they will sometimes give you the names of their fellow cleaners or kitchen staff in a care home, but as soon as they start talking to each other they think, well we\u2019d better talk to our manager, and the manager says oh no \u2013 you\u2019d better not do this,\u201d said Jones. \u201cAnd the fact is that in all of these care settings but also in the NHS, there is no culture for contact tracing. There\u2019s also no culture of self-isolation. \u201cThe emotional side of this is me listening to our volunteers every night saying: \u2018I have got all this information, I\u2019ve tried to get in touch with the helper at the care home and then the shutters come down. I got in touch with the trust \u2013 the teaching hospital trust \u2013 and bang, the shutters come down.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re talking here about a major problem and a major deficiency particularly around health and care workers. My analogy is that health and care workers are unwittingly acting as the vectors of this \u2026 spread.\u201d The group\u2019s volunteers had the authority of GP practices and a well-respected community development organisation yet were unable to convince people to self-isolate. Jones thinks the government scheme \u2013 due to be up and running by 1 June staffed by 25,000 contact tracers, most of them call handlers with a script and minimal training \u2013 will fare no better. \u201cI feel sad to have to say this but the whole way that this is unfolding \u2013 I have no confidence in the government. The app has failed, they\u2019ve failed in their testing, on their PPE. I wouldn\u2019t put any money on their sorting out this contact tracing,\u201d Jones said. The spreading of infection through health and care workers was predictable, he said, and identified in a study in the town of Vo\u2019 in Italy. He said: \u201cWhy does it take a group of retired doctors to come up with this? It is fatuous that people haven\u2019t twigged that in the care home setting it is quite obvious \u2013 there is very little expertise, very little money, no reserve of staffing, so it\u2019s inevitable that people will be moving around within and between care homes.

      "bodyText": "Oxfam International\u2019s announcement that it will close operations in countries including Afghanistan and Haiti has prompted fears that regions are being abandoned just as the coronavirus pandemic makes them more vulnerable. Oxfam said the impact of Covid-19 on its finances had forced it to fast-track a global restructuring programme, which entails the closure of 18 country offices. The NGO was already trying to deal with a drop in public donations after the Haiti sex abuse scandal in 2018. Oxfam\u2019s finances have been further hit by having to close its shops as a result of coronavirus restrictions, losing it \u00a35m every month. Civil society groups and social workers are concerned the dramatic changes might signal a scaling-back of the role NGOs play in providing vital services. Social worker Modaser Islami said the closure of Oxfam\u2019s Afghanistan office, which opened in 1961, will leave big gaps in aid provision, especially in rural areas. \u201cThe issue right now is not about improving our situation, it\u2019s about surviving. There are more and more people coming on to the streets asking for help and without it, they say they wouldn\u2019t be able to eat,\u201d said Islami. He fears the Afghan government is not in a strong enough position to support the country\u2019s poorest if aid groups begin leaving and foreign governments do not help plug the gap. \u201cIt\u2019s most worrying because the type of work Oxfam has been doing improved livelihoods in rural areas where most others don\u2019t reach, both aid groups and governments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no other sources of incomes, just a little land, and face challenges getting healthcare, also education.\u201d Oxfam closures will affect offices in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, and result in the loss of 1,450 programme staff. Pedro Vega, a member of a farmers\u2019 association in Paraguay that received support from Oxfam, said the NGO\u2019s withdrawal was a great loss. \u201cOxfam helped our association to make a very important leap forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt showed that if NGOs\u2019 projects are well implemented, they can create change, help construct a different way of living in the countryside and get our produce the real value that it deserves.\u201d Oxfam has been in Paraguay for 28 years and worked collaboratively with more than 60 local organisations on projects including those promoting women\u2019s rights and sustainable development. In a statement, \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez, head of Oxfam Paraguay, said: \u201cWe hope that our contribution to strengthening civil society will continue to bear fruit.\u201d Carlos Mejia, the executive director of Oxfam in Colombia, said: \u201cThe decision to leave countries was anything but easy, it was a painful decision.\u201d Insiders say Oxfam\u2019s restructuring is expected to impact other parts of the charity in the coming weeks, including at its Oxford headquarters in the UK. An Oxfam GB spokesperson said that aside from the announcements made by the international charity, its largest national affiliate will now have to reduce its expenditure and review plans made before the pandemic. Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the House of Commons international development committee, said the announcement will \u201cfurther concern struggling communities who rely on the assistance of aid organisations\u201d. Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, whose committee is examining the impact of the pandemic on developing countries, said the loss of income for NGOs was already having a chilling effect on their work. \u201cWe have received evidence that NGO charities are suffering huge losses of income due to lockdown and as donor governments, businesses and individuals all feel their own economic and financial challenges. This is already starting to have a chilling effect on the humanitarian and development capacity of UK NGOs and their crucial work abroad.\u201d Stephanie Draper, the CEO of Bond, the international development network, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to see such a big name not being able to respond to the real need in countries around the world.\u201d The challenges of the coronavirus presented a \u201cbleak picture for our members right now\u201d, Draper added. Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children, said: \u201cOxfam is a brilliant organisation that does desperately needed work across all of these countries. I\u2019m very sad that, because of the financial situation they are in, they have had to make these decisions. All of us are saddened by it.\u201d Save the Children does not have any plans to cut programmes, he said. Among the closures will be Oxfam\u2019s office in Haiti, a country that has had a complicated relationship with international charities. It has yet to respond publicly to the planned closure. Locals have relied heavily on NGOs for care and support, which at times have supplanted government assistance. When the 2010 earthquake turned much of the country\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince to rubble, around 10,000 aid organisations assisted with the recovery. \u201cUsually when there\u2019s a crisis everyone comes to help, but this time [during the coronavirus] the airport is closed and no one is coming,\u201d said Laure Bottinelli, the founder of Anacaona Community, a soap recycling social business based in Port-au-Prince. \u201cInstead, international organisations are leaving, and taking a bunch of jobs with them.

      "bodyText": "The owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain is raising \u00a31bn from shareholders to shore up its finances as the budget hotel operator warned its UK sites could be closed or barely occupied until September. Whitbread said it might not make a profit in the year ahead as it was burning through \u00a380m of cash a month while its income had been all but wiped out in the coronavirus crisis. Hotel room, and food and drink revenues at the firm dived 99% in the seven weeks to 14 May after Premier Inn closed the majority of its sites in late March. Just 39 of the group\u2019s 821 UK hotels have remained open, to cater for NHS and other key workers during the lockdown. Another 16 hotels in Germany reopened on 11 May. The group hopes to open another 60 UK hotels in June \u2013 after the government loosened rules on the workers allowed to use hotels to include a long list of sectors such as utilities, IT and food production. The entire Premier Inn estate could reopen in early July, but the company said it was assuming its hotels would not be fully open until September as the UK government may not free up tourist travel until then. Once open, hotels will operate with physical distancing measures including a ban on breakfast buffets, restrictions on sharing lifts and temperature checks for staff. Even in the autumn, business is expected to pick up only gradually once physical distancing restrictions are relaxed. Alison Brittain, the chief executive, said Whitbread was well positioned to take advantage of a likely switch to \u201cstaycations\u201d because its simple hotels did not have spas, gyms or other services where it was difficult to maintain physical distancing. She said Whitbread did not need the \u00a31bn to stay afloat, with the money intended as a fighting fund to make acquisitions and expand as weaker chains and independents are hit by the coronavirus crisis. The hotel group is also hoping to snap up retail and pub sites that may become available.

Greater Manchester became the latest city to announce it was putting off the implementation of a clean air zone (CAZ), raising concerns that a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis was being put on hold.

HGVs, LGVs, buses and taxis would be charged to enter the zone if they did not meet nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions standards. Private cars would not be charged.

      "bodyText": "The government is poised to push for a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, one of the new Tory party MPs has said, in a way that could wipe out the mistakes made in shutting down the coal industry under Margaret Thatcher. \u201cI very much hope we will hear about a green recovery soon from ministers,\u201d said Alexander Stafford, who took one of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d seats in northern England in last December\u2019s landslide election victory. \u201cWe want a recovery, we want it green, so we will work for a green recovery.\u201d Stafford is MP for Rother Valley in Yorkshire, site of the infamous Battle of Orgreave during the miner\u2019s strike in 1984. He said the move away from coal in the 1980s under the Conservatives had produced upheaval and job losses, which could be avoided in a green recovery if people\u2019s skills were redeployed to renewable energy and other clean technology. \u201cIf people lose their jobs and their livelihoods, they are not going to be on board with the green message,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 1980s under Thatcher, the closure of the coal mines, there was a cliff edge, a cut-off, that created lots of social problems and economic problems. We need to manage the transition better. We can\u2019t leave anyone behind. If we leave people behind, we will lose goodwill and public support.\u201d The UK was in prime position to create a \u201chuge bonanza of jobs\u201d in renewable energy and other green industries, he told the Guardian. \u201cIn the 1980s there was no support for mining workers. People were not properly equipped to look to new jobs. We have to support people into jobs.\u201d The coronavirus crisis had heightened people\u2019s awareness of how the economy could be changed, he said. \u201cWe have the opportunity to reshape our economy.\u201d He contrasted the public\u2019s willingness to look to green economic growth with the activism and civil disobedience of Extinction Rebellion. \u201cThey are extreme, and it is not working,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be done in a way that shows the economic benefits that a green recovery could bring. \u201cExtinction Rebellion has made [the climate crisis] very visible, but they have gone far too far with their direct action, way beyond the pale, and that puts people off.\u201d Stafford, who worked for the green campaigning charity WWF and then oil giant Shell before entering parliament, said the influx of new MPs was supportive of green measures. \u201cThis is one of the most effective internal lobby groups in the party,\u201d he told a webinar on the green recovery held on Thursday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a green advisory group. One of the first policies for a green recovery could be home insulation, he said. The government currently has no overarching strategy for improving the energy efficiency of the UK\u2019s draughty homes, an omission that has caused a slump in the number of homes being insulated in the last five years. The Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory adviser, has written to the prime minister to urge measures including a boost to home insulation, renewable energy, electric vehicle infrastructure, tree planting and the restoration of peatlands, all of which it said would create new green jobs quickly and reduce the UK\u2019s emissions in line with long-term low-carbon goals. A study by Oxford University earlier this month found that focusing on the green economy would produce greater returns for public money, in the short and long term, than pouring cash into a conventional fossil-fuelled recovery. Ministers have said little publicly on how the recovery from the coronavirus crisis might be achieved in a way compatible with the UK\u2019s long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, as attention has focused on the immediate health and economic crises. On Thursday, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, announced \u00a340m in new funding for fledgling green startups. Earlier this week, the Labour party told the Guardian of its proposals for a \u201clow-carbon army\u201d, building on the plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d in the party\u2019s manifesto last year.",

On Wednesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">threatened to withhold federal funding</a> for mail-in voting in those states, inaccurately and misleadingly citing \u201cvoter fraud\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPhew, there are two surefire ways to piss Donald Trump off: showing him that shirtless photo of Obama, and giving people access to mail-in votes,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI guess in Trump\u2019s mind, voting should be like your wife smiling at you \u2013 once a year, in public, and never at home.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, Michigan is not \u201csending out ballots\u201d, as Trump claimed; it\u2019s sending out mail-in ballot applications, as are several other Republican-leaning states. \u201cSo clearly, Trump is just looking for an excuse to avoid losing,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>And as the election gets closer, \u201cTrump is just gonna get crazier,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cHe\u2019s going to start sounding like one of those second-graders playing sports \u2013 \u2018The results from Wisconsin don\u2019t count \u2013 I didn\u2019t say I was ready!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkz3Mde4PNE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pkz3Mde4PNE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWe are in week nine \u2026 thousand? of stay-at-home,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, and \u201cpeople are getting restless, people are craving other human beings.\u201d Still, that didn\u2019t lessen the annoyance of what Kimmel declared the \u201ccardinal sin of quarantine\u201d: the random, unannounced neighborly drop-by that you can\u2019t escape, since it\u2019s not like you\u2019re out on the town. \u201cThose need to stop,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cAnd while we\u2019re at it, family zoom calls? Let\u2019s max those out at 12 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>In other news, Kimmel continued to follow the unspooling \u201chydroxy horror picture show\u201d in which Trump claimed to be taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, for coronavirus (this is an unproven treatment with potentially lethal side-effects). This has reportedly, according to Kimmel, led some Trump followers to attempt making the drug at home, which \u201cto me, is good old-fashioned American initiative\u201d, he said. \u201cBoil up some homemade hydroxy, what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, if you\u2019re dumb enough to think it\u2019s a good idea to make your own hydroxychloroquine at home, you\u2019re probably not smart enough to make your own hydroxychloroquine at home,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cMost people can\u2019t even make a lemon meringue pie.\u201d</p>",

Meanwhile, reports have tracked the conflict brewing between the Trump administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency usually known as a beacon for public health. \u201cYou know, a pandemic is not the best time to be feuding with that particular agency,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cYou never saw FDR pick a fight with the Center for Defeating Nazis.\u201d CDC officials have claimed that they\u2019ve been \u201cmuzzled\u201d by the administration, particularly over its guidelines for how to reopen safely, which the administration ignored because they were \u201coverly specific\u201d. Based on those original guidelines, none of the places reopening currently qualify. \u201cSo instead, this week, the CDC released watered-down criteria, because if you can\u2019t meet the safety guidelines, just change them!\u201d said Colbert. \u201cSame way a sign that says \u2018Danger! Electricity, do not enter,\u2019 is a buzzkill, so you change it to \u2018Danger! Electricity, but maybe you\u2019ll get superpowers, get in here you wuss!\u2019\u201d Colbert cited some examples of how the administration weakened the CDC\u2019s original guidelines: \u201censure social distancing\u201d became \u201cpromote social distancing\u201d, and the phrase \u201cif possible\u201d was added to several sentences. \u201cAnd of course, the title is now \u2018CDC guidelines for you to follow \u2026 or not. Whatevs.\u2019\u201d Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated another Trump Twitter freakout, this time over mail-in voting applications in Nevada and Michigan. On Wednesday, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for mail-in voting in those states, inaccurately and misleadingly citing \u201cvoter fraud\u201d. \u201cPhew, there are two surefire ways to piss Donald Trump off: showing him that shirtless photo of Obama, and giving people access to mail-in votes,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI guess in Trump\u2019s mind, voting should be like your wife smiling at you \u2013 once a year, in public, and never at home.\u201d To be clear, Michigan is not \u201csending out ballots\u201d, as Trump claimed; it\u2019s sending out mail-in ballot applications, as are several other Republican-leaning states. \u201cSo clearly, Trump is just looking for an excuse to avoid losing,\u201d Noah said. And as the election gets closer, \u201cTrump is just gonna get crazier,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cHe\u2019s going to start sounding like one of those second-graders playing sports \u2013 \u2018The results from Wisconsin don\u2019t count \u2013 I didn\u2019t say I was ready!\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel \u201cWe are in week nine \u2026 thousand? of stay-at-home,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, and \u201cpeople are getting restless, people are craving other human beings.\u201d Still, that didn\u2019t lessen the annoyance of what Kimmel declared the \u201ccardinal sin of quarantine\u201d: the random, unannounced neighborly drop-by that you can\u2019t escape, since it\u2019s not like you\u2019re out on the town. \u201cThose need to stop,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cAnd while we\u2019re at it, family zoom calls? Let\u2019s max those out at 12 minutes.\u201d In other news, Kimmel continued to follow the unspooling \u201chydroxy horror picture show\u201d in which Trump claimed to be taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, for coronavirus (this is an unproven treatment with potentially lethal side-effects). This has reportedly, according to Kimmel, led some Trump followers to attempt making the drug at home, which \u201cto me, is good old-fashioned American initiative\u201d, he said. \u201cBoil up some homemade hydroxy, what could possibly go wrong? \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, if you\u2019re dumb enough to think it\u2019s a good idea to make your own hydroxychloroquine at home, you\u2019re probably not smart enough to make your own hydroxychloroquine at home,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cMost people can\u2019t even make a lemon meringue pie.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The British public relaxed its adherence to lockdown restrictions in the weeks before they were officially loosened, according to new data. Across the UK people had already started to make more trips to parks even before Boris Johnson eased restrictions on movement. On several occasions in recent weeks, people were going to parks at the same rate as they were before the lockdown. The data released by Google compares footfall based on the number of mobile devices detected in settings before and after restrictions were imposed. The prime minister\u2019s \u201cStay alert\u201d address was aired on Sunday 10 May. It followed briefings from Downing Street that lockdown restrictions would be loosened, resulting in newspaper headlines, including \u201cHappy Monday\u201d and \u201cHurrah! Lockdown freedom beckons\u201d on Wednesday 6 May. The announcement did not immediately affect footfall in parks as the increases were part of a wider trend. However, the increase in movement in parks did coincide with Downing Street briefings and newspaper headlines that the lockdown would soon be eased. Every day between 4 May and 8 May, movement in parks exceeded pre-lockdown levels, with footfall reaching 16% above the baseline on Wednesday 6 and Thursday 7 May, the highest level since the lockdown began. Footfall in parks has exceeded baseline levels \u2013 defined as the median footfall on the equivalent day of the week as recorded between 3 January and 6 February \u2013 on seven of the 10 days to 13 May, with weekdays experiencing the largest increases. Conversely, weekend visits to parks are down on pre-lockdown levels, perhaps indicating that people are taking exercise on weekdays while avoiding parks on Saturdays and Sundays due to concerns about overcrowding. The UK has also experienced a gradual increase in footfall in other settings, with activity in transit hubs and workplaces also edging up in recent weeks. While these figures remain far below the baseline \u2013 the median footfall for the corresponding day of the week in January to February \u2013 the activity in transit hubs was 38% of the equivalent day of the week pre-lockdown on five days since 6 May, their highest since the restrictions were put in place. Similarly, workplace activity reached 55% of pre-lockdown levels on the day of Johnson\u2019s speech, although it should be noted that this compares that Sunday with a typical Sunday in January or February, and not a weekday, which would be busier. The trends captured in the Google data collection are also reflected in other datasets. The government has published daily charts detailing transport changes in the UK since the onset of the pandemic, as part of its daily coronavirus briefings. These show that, while the proportion of people using public transport remains low compared with normal times, the proportion of car journeys has been trending upwards in recent weeks, hitting 50% of the baseline on four consecutive days in the past week. Apple data as of 19 May also shows that the number of people searching for driving directions was 35% lower than its January baseline, walking was 38% under and transit at 75% under. However, all three measures have seen rises in recent weeks. While equivalent data for Italy and Spain shows that rates there broadly remain lower than that in the UK, searches for driving and walking in Germany and the US, where lockdown restrictions have been eased, have soared in recent weeks. US car journeys exceeded baseline levels on both Friday and Saturday as yet more states loosened travel restrictions and were just 1% below the baseline on 19 May. In Germany, driving was within 2% of the baseline level on the same date, while walking was 8% below and transit stood at 30% below the 13 January level.",

      "bodyText": "The Indian city of Kolkata has been left devastated by the worst cyclone it has seen in 100 years, which swept through India and Bangladesh on Wednesday and killed at least 84 people. Kolkata, home to almost 15 million people, bore the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which tore roofs off buildings, smashed windows, pulled down trees and pylons and overturned cars. Most of the fatalities were caused by falling trees or electrocution. Millions of people were left without power and telephone connection, and some areas were without drinking water. Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state, of which Kolkata is the capital, said the damage was like \u201cnothing I have seen in my life\u201d and two districts of the city had been \u201ccompletely devastated. We have to rebuild those districts from scratch.\u201d She said: \u201cArea after area has been ruined. I have experienced a war-like situation today.\u201d Banerjee noted how particularly catastrophic the storm was in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, with people forced to prioritise seeking shelter over efforts to curb the spread of the virus. \u201cWe are facing three crises: the coronavirus, the thousands of migrants who are returning home, and now the cyclone,\u201d she said. Kalipada Haldar, whose shack made from bamboo and plastic sheets was destroyed by Amphan, said he had recently lost his job in a cardboard factory when it closed down as a result of Covid-19 lockdown measures. \u201cFor the past two months I have been without a job. Somehow I have been running my family with the small amount of rations I get from the government. I was already in hardship after the factory was closed.

Searches for survivors in the wreckage continued on Thursday and rescue teams in West Bengal said they had not yet been able to reach the worst-hit areas. Selima Khatun, living in Dhoni village in one of the worst hit districts in West Bengal, North 24 Paraganas, said over 80% of the mud-and-bamboo houses in her village had been destroyed by Amphan. \u201cMany people have taken shelter on the roofs of the concrete houses, which are the only buildings left,\u201d said Khatun. \u201cMy family are sheltering on the first floor of our village mosque along with around 100 other people.

The UN\u2019s office in Bangladesh estimated that 10 million people were affected and 500,000 people may have lost their homes.

The intended men\u2019s visits of West Indies and Pakistan could be announced as early as next week, as well as the grounds being used, with Wasim Khan, the chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, telling Sky\u2019s Cricket show on Thursday that \u201cas things stand, we are looking forward to the tour\u201d. A 25-man Pakistan squad to cover both red- and white-all series faces up to three months in locked down conditions, however, with a June training camp in Lahore before making the journey over for a spell of quarantine and more training before the proposed first Test in Manchester on 5 August. The ECB\u2019s detailed biosecure plans, as outlined in the Observer on Sunday, are understood to have become a template that other boards intend to follow. South Africa\u2019s director of cricket, Graeme Smith, has even suggested England as a neutral venue for the Tests and T20s his side were due to play against West Indies in August.The logistics make this hard to picture. English cricket remains in the foothills of its own ambitious project, and will require an improved national landscape for government approval for games. But phase one officially got under way on Thursday with a first run out for a handful of the bowlers. Broad, Woakes and Sam Curran all shared videos of themselves in action on social media, the former demonstrating some the stringent measures in place with photos of a pre-session temperature check and the ladies toilet allocated solely for his use at Trent Bridge.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. Another blizzard of economic data has shown that the world economy is being battered by the Covid-19 outbreak, but a slow recovery may In the UK, factory and service sector bosses reported that activity remained very weak, with output slumping, new orders much lower than usual and unemployment up. But the pace of the decline did ease, with the composite PMI rising to 28.9, from 13.8 [50 = stagnation]. Economists warned that the recovery will be slow and bumpy, and unlikely to resemble anything like a V. Eurozone companies reported a similar picture - with Germany coping relatively well and the periphery (including Italy and Spain) suffering a sharper slowdown. In America, another 2.4 million people filed unemployment benefit claims -- pushing the total number of jobs lost over 38m. The US PMI report also showed a slump in activity, but with some signs that activity is picking up as the lockdown eases. Japan, though, reported that exports slumped by over 20% last month, which is the worst drop since the 2009 recession. Investors are fretting that relations between the US and China are deteriorating, with Donald Trump accusing Xi Jinping of pushing a \u201cdisinformation and propaganda attack\u201d on the West. With China threatening to hit back, European stock markets ended the day lower. Budget airline easyJet announced plans to resume domestic flights within the UK, and within France, as it tries to resume operations. Hotel operator Whitbread launched a \u00a31bn cash call to shore up its finances and to expand through the crisis. Here\u2019s our latest stories: Goodnight. GW That late selloff came after China threatened to hit back against America if it imposes sanctions over the coronavirus pandemic. The spokesman for the country\u2019s parliament, Zhang Yesui, told reporters that Beijing would retaliate if the US introduced legislation last week to give Donald Trump the power to sanction China. Zhang indicated that Trump was trying to cover up his own mistake over the pandemic saying: \u201cWe firmly oppose these Bills, and will make a firm response and take countermeasures based on the deliberation of these Bills. \u201cIt is neither responsible nor moral to cover up one\u2019s own problems by blaming others. We will never accept any unwarranted lawsuits and demands for compensation. More details here. After a late stumble, Europe\u2019s stock markets have ended the day lower than they started it. FTSE 100: down 51 points or 0.9% at 6,015 Germany\u2019s DAX: down 157 points or 1.4% at 11,065 French CAC: down 51 points or 1.1% at 4,445 Italian FTSE MIB: down 126 points or 0.75% at 17,087 Back in the UK, shoe retailer Clarks has joined the ranks of firms cutting jobs due to the pandemic. More than 900 head office staff will go, as the Covid-19 lockdown hits sales hard, on top of the problems on the high street. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe reports that some Americans have been struggling to sign on for unemployment benefit, due to huge demand: Aya Rabbaa, 19, lost her job at an iHop restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin, eight weeks ago and only received her benefits three days ago. \u201cI would call and hang on hold for hours or they would hang up,\u201d she said. The college student relied on her wages to pay her expenses and said it had been a real struggle while she waited on the money. \u201cThey need to do something,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hungry, people are stressed. Do we live in a third world country or what?\u201d Now Wisconsin is open for business again after its supreme court struck down the state\u2019s stay-at-home order. Rabbaa said she was worried about going back to work if and when the restaurant opens for business. \u201cI\u2019d go back but I am scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not safe. If I get it then the customers will get it and if they have it, I will get it.\u201d After that positive start, the US stock market is turning south. The Dow has now dipped by 193 points, or 0.8%, to 24,381. Oil has shed its early gains too, and European markets are in the red too as the closing bell approaches.... Bonds are strengthening, though, pushing the yield on British five-year debt below zero! Our economics editor Larry Elliott says today\u2019s PMI reports show we face a long trudge back to recovery, writing: Well, do you want the good news or the bad news? The goods news \u2013 both for the UK and for the rest of Europe \u2013 is that the worst is over. April marked the bottom of the slump triggered by the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Provided there is no second wave of infection (a pretty hefty qualification, admittedly) last month was as bad as it gets. The bad news is that a return to pre-crisis levels of activity is a long way off and, as things stand, will be measured in years not months. There is more chance of spotting a yeti in the Himalayas than there is of a sighting of the equally elusive V-shaped recovery.... More here: Just in: America\u2019s economy is suffering another slump in output this month as the Covid-19 downturn persists. Data firm Markit has reported that the US economy is still contracting at a desperately sharp pace, although slightly slower than in April. Its latest survey of purchasing managers found that production and new orders have tumbled at US factories. Service sector firms are suffering sharp falls in orders due to weak domestic and foreign client demand. Job cuts, unsurprisingly, were deep. With things slightly less dire than in April, Markit\u2019s US \u2018composite PMI\u2019 has risen to 36.4, from 27.0 in April. That indicates another very sharp contraction (50 would be stagnation). Markit explains: Although the overall contraction in new business eased in May, it was still the second-steepest in the series history. Firms continued to report significant decreases in client demand as customers further postponed the placement of orders. Service sector and manufacturing firms registered the second-sharpest reductions in new orders since the global financial crisis. Foreign client demand remained especially muted, with new export orders decreasing substantially and at only a slightly reduced rate compared to April as lockdowns associated with the virus pandemic persisted across key export markets. Reflecting the further severe drop in new business, firms cut workforce members at a marked pace in May. The initial claims figures, although bad, don\u2019t capture the full extent of the jobs lost in the crisis. Another 2.2 million new claims were filed through the federal government\u2019s temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. It\u2019s designed to help gig economy workers, independent contractors and other self-employed workers, who might not be able file traditional jobless claims. Wall Street is unperturbed by today\u2019s US jobless numbers. The Dow has gained 57 points or 0.2% in early trading to 24,633 points, despite traders learning that another 2.4m Americans are now on the dole. The S&amp;P 500 is also slightly higher, having recovered a large chunk of its hefty fall in March. In London, the FTSE 100 has shaken off its earlier losses and is up 17 points at 6084. Top risers include Rolls-Royce (+6%) after announcing 9,000 job losses yesterday, and AstraZeneca, which says it can manufacture 1bn doses of the University of Oxford\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine. Back in the UK, workers at Royal Bank of Scotland are preparing to work from home for a while yet. RBS told staff today that more than 50,00 of them (out of 65,000) won\u2019t return to the office until at least the end of September. However, about 400 workers whose jobs include handling sensitive data have been asked to return to offices and call centres next month. More here: Several economists are concerned that America\u2019s jobless claims haven\u2019t levelled out faster: America has just passed a grim milestone in its unemployment crisis. Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao has spotted that more jobs have been lost in the last nine weeks than during the last recession a decade ago: \u201cToday\u2019s sky-high unemployment insurance claims report brings the total UI claims to 38.6 million and surpasses yet another historical benchmark. In only nine weeks, unemployment claims made during the coronavirus crisis have already exceeded the 37 million claims made over the entire 18 months of the Great Recession. The coronavirus crisis continues to inflict swift and deep impacts on the labor market at a near unprecedented clip. Before Covid-19, the idea of more than two million Americans losing their jobs in a single week would be unimaginable, let alone 38 million joining the unemployment ranks in two months. As this tweet shows, the job losses since March absolutely dwarf the impact of the financial crisis - wiping out all the gains since then. Newsflash: Another 2.4 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, as the US jobs crisis deepens. That\u2019s down from 2.6 million in the previous seven days (which has been revised down from 2.9m). But it\u2019s the ninth week in a row in which millions of US citizens signed on for welfare benefits, having lost their job in the lockdown. The total number of initial claims filed since mid-March is now over 38 million, or over a fifth of the US labor force. The number of continued claims (for workers who were already on the jobless total) also jumped again to over 25m, from 22.5m. Oof! US department store Macy\u2019s has warned that its sales have fallen by around 45% in the last quarter, as the coronavirus shutdown drove it into the red. Preliminary results show that sales at Macy\u2019s in February-April fell to between $3,000m and $3,030m, down from $5,504. It made an operating loss of around $1.1bn, down from an operating profit of $203m a year earlier. The company shut all its stores - including department chain Bloomingdale\u2019s and beauty chain Bluemercury - on 18 March, leading to a slump in takings. \u201cThis is a challenging time for the country, for retail and for Macy\u2019s, Inc. COVID-19 has impacted the lives of many of our colleagues and customers, and health and safety remain our top priority. We closed all of our stores - Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury - on March 18, which had a significant impact on our first quarter results,\u201d said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer, said it is a challenging time for the country, for retail and for Macy\u2019s itself. \u201cLooking back, our performance in February was solid and in line with our expectations, but we saw a precipitous decline in sales with the stores closure in March. As a developed omnichannel retailer, we experienced a steady uptick in our digital business in April, which was encouraging, but only partially offset the loss of sales from the stores. The digital performance was driven by strong execution and enhanced fulfillment options, including curbside pickup where allowed.\u201d This morning\u2019s PMI reports from the UK and the eurozone haven\u2019t lifted spirits in the markets. The FTSE 100 is still down 0.8% at 6018 points, a loss of 48 points so far, after the City heard that UK manufacturers and services companies were having such a rough time. Wall Street is expected to open lower, with the Dow down 145 points (roughly 0.6%) in pre-market trading and traders nudging the safe-haven dollar a little higher. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s UK PMI report: Newsflash: UK manufacturing output has fallen over the last quarter at the fastest rate since at least 1975. Output volumes fell in 15 of 17 manufacturing sub-sectors in March-May, according to the latest healthcheck from the CBI. Motor vehicles and transport equipment, and food, drink and tobacco, suffered the sharpest tumbles. while pharmaceuticals and electronic engineering output rose. This pulled down the CBI\u2019s measure of output volumes in the last quarter to -54%, from -21% in April (the balance between firms reporting higher output vs lower). This isn\u2019t a massive surprise, given the widespread shutdowns across UK factories to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. But worryingly, manufacturers predict that output volumes will keep falling over the next three months, with many reporting that their order books have shrunk alarmingly. The survey also found that: 84% of respondents had seen a negative impact on their domestic output. 68% of manufacturers reported a negative impact on their international output. 51% of manufacturers reported a partial shutdown/closure. 59% of manufacturers mentioned that they had temporarily laid off staff, while 9% reported permanent layoffs. 74% of firms had faced cash flow difficulties. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, says UK manufacturing faces a \u201cchallenging\u201d future: \u201cThese results show that UK manufacturers are still grappling with the impact of the pandemic. Production levels have fallen even more sharply as firms experience collapsing demand and supply chain disruption, leading some to temporarily shut down their factories. The sector is bracing for what will be a challenging period. Duncan Brock, Group Director at CIPS, fears that a second wave of Covid-19 infections could undermine hopes of a recovery (sending the PMI skittering back down to April\u2019s record lows). The minor easing in the downturn compared to last month\u2019s figures only serves to highlight the depth of the fall in April\u2019s output and does not signal that the pathway is clear for an improvement in the manufacturing and services sectors. \u201cThis month saw another steep fall in overall business activity, surpassing for the third time the rates of decline seen during the global financial crisis in 2009. No new orders, premises shut down and furloughed staff unable to return to work were at the heart of the desolation as business struggled to continue with two hands tied behind their back. Even some heavy discounting by companies did little to offset their losses which are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg with businesses failing in increasing numbers. \u201cAs the sectors prepare for a further easing in restrictions and becoming covid-ready for staff to return, the danger on the horizon is a second wave of infections threatening the health of the nation and dampening consumer confidence still further. In addition, if this intensity of job cuts continues, purse strings will be drawn tightly shut and spending severely curtailed, putting further pressure on the UK economy and ensuring any recovery is many years into the future.\u201d Here\u2019s Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics on today\u2019s UK purchasing managers survey: Taken literally the fact the flash composite PMI remained well below the no-change level of 50 in May suggests that activity fell further as it should compare activity to the previous month. But many respondents appear to be answering the alternate question of \u201chow is activity compared to normal?\u201d. So instead it appears to be suggesting that the low point for activity was reached in April, but that it is still well below normal in May. The recovery in the manufacturing PMI from 32.6 to 40.6 is probably a sign that some industrial plants have reopened on government advice. And the services index recovered from 13.4 to 27.8, in line with anecdotal evidence that firms have restarted limited operations, such as take-out options from restaurants. A few weeks ago, there was lots of talk about V-shaped recoveries. Economists hoped that growth would bounce back sharply from the initial shock of Covid-19, as companies rapidly caught up on lost business. It always seemed a little optimistic -- no-one is going to get two haircuts, order three restaurant specials or watch four football matches in a day once the crisis is over (but lets not rule out two specials....) The message from today\u2019s PMI surveys is clear -- businesses across the eurozone and UK have suffered major damage under the lockdown, and the downturn is not over. Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Miton, says the recovery is some way away: \u201cThe PMI data in from the UK and Europe suggests that the outlook is improving. That is to be expected, as the surveys are taken mid-month and economies were more open than they were in mid-April. But with UK Composite PMI at 28.9, albeit up from 13.8 in April, and the Eurozone Composite PMI reading at 30.5 the outlook is still grim. Markets may well take this as a sign that the nadir has been reached, although recovery is some time off.\u201d James Smith and Bert Colijn of ING agree that the recovery certainly won\u2019t resemble a perky V. CBI chief economist Alpesh Paleja agrees that May is a \u2018pretty awful\u2019 month for businesses: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy continued to suffer an unprecedented contraction this month. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are shrinking extremely rapidly as the lockdown continues, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit. But there are also signs that the pace of the downturn is easing a little. Here\u2019s the details of the PMI reports: UK Composite Output Index for May: 28.9, up from 13.8 in April UK flash manufacturing PMI: 40.6, up from 32.9 UK services flash PMI: 27.8, up from 12.3 Any reading below 50 shows a fall in activity, so the UK economy certainly hasn\u2019t returned to growth yet. It\u2019s simply shrinking at a slower pace. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe UK economy remains firmly locked in an unprecedented downturn, with business activity and employment continuing to slump at alarming rates in May. Although the pace of decline has eased since April\u2019s record collapse, May saw the second largest monthly falls in output and jobs seen over the survey\u2019s 22-year history, the rates of decline continuing to far exceed anything seen previously. Travel and tourism firms, hotels, restaurants and producers of consumer goods such as clothing were again the hardest hit, reflecting virus containment measures, but this remains a shockingly broad-based downturn with very few companies left unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic. UK companies reported that activity was painfully low this month, due to business shutdowns, cancellations of customer orders and a general slump in demand amid the coronavirus pandemic. Firms also suffered another rapid declines in new work and employment across the UK private sector, nearly as bad as the record lows seen in April. These graphs highlight just how sharply the UK economy has shrunk since the pandemic started: Although a PMI of 30.5 is better than one of 13.6, it\u2019s still extremely weak - showing a profound economic downturn this month. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, reckons today\u2019s PMI surveys show that the downturn is bottoming out: \u201cThe eurozone saw a further collapse of business activity in May but the survey data at least brought reassuring signs that the downturn likely bottomed out in April. Second quarter GDP is still likely to fall at an unprecedented rate, down by around 10% compared to the first quarter, but the rise in the PMI adds to expectations that the downturn should continue to moderate as lockdown restrictions are further lifted heading into the summer. All eurozone countries eased their COVID-19 containment measures to some extent in May, helping to moderate the overall rate of economic decline. However, while a further loosening of restrictions is anticipated in coming months, some measures to contain the virus are likely to remain in place until an effective treatment or vaccine is found. Newsflash: The eurozone economy continues to suffer an unprecedented decline this month, although the slump is easing as some Covid-19 lockdown measures are relaxed. The Eurozone Composite PMI, which tracks activity across the euro area, has risen to 30.5 in May from a record low of 13.6 in April. That still shows an extremely sharp downturn -- worse than at any stage of the financial crisis. Any reading below 50 indicates the economy shrank. Data firm Markit, which compiles the PMI, says: The eurozone economy remained stuck in its deepest downturn ever recorded in May due to ongoing measures taken to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, according to provisional PMI survey data. However, the rate of decline eased as parts of the economy started to emerge from lockdowns. Companies reported that they were cutting jobs at an unprecedented rate, with output falling, supply chains disrupted, and many non-essential businesses closing. Germany again saw a modestly milder downturn than France while the rest of the eurozone saw the steepest decline. And although bosses are more optimistic than in April, confidence is still extraordinarily low. Japan has suffered its worst drop in exports since the financial crisis over a decade ago , denting hopes that the world economy could be turning the corner. Japanese exports slumped by almost 22% year-on-year in April, led by tumbling demand for cars and industrial goods. Exports to the US were down 37.8%, with auto exports down by two-thirds. Shares in budget airline easyJet have jumped 5% in early trading, after it announced it will resume some flights from mid-June. Face masks will be compulsory, as the airline tries to operate while obeying physical distancing rules. My colleague Jo Partridge explains: The airline initially will restart domestic routes in the UK and France where it believes \u201cthere is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying\u201d. The carrier will add further routes in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe. The company will introduce enhanced cleaning and disinfection of its aircraft, will make disinfectant wipes and hand sanitiser available on board, and will require all passengers and cabin crew, as well as ground crew, to wear masks. There will be no food service onboard, initially. Hotels group Whitbread are the top faller in London, down over 16% after announcing a \u00a31bn rights issue. This will shore up Whitbread\u2019s finances to handle the Covid-19 recession. It told investors that the funds will give it the \u201cconfidence and flexibility\u201d to keep operating and invest in the UK and Germany. The firm reckons there are opportunities to expand, as \u201cits budget-branded and independent competitors are expected to be weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d More ominously, the money will also provide \u201cfurther liquidity headroom in the event of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d. Investors can buy one new share, at \u00a315, for each two they already own. That\u2019s a 37.4% discount on the \u201ctheoretical ex-rights price of \u00a32,395\u201d. Shares in Whitbread have fallen smartly to this level, down 440p at \u00a324.01. Whitbread, which owns Premier Inns, had entered the crisis with \u00a3300m in the bank and a \u00a3950m revolving credit facility. But the lockdown means it faces a \u201cvery material loss of revenue\u201d for the current financial year, having already furloughed staff and shut hotels. Anxiety over US-China relations is weighing on the London stock market. The FTSE 100 index has dropped by 50 points, or 0.85%, in early trading to 6,016. France and Germany are both down over 1%. Consumer-focused companies, technology firms, and financial groups are among the fallers -- reflecting worries over the global economic outlook. Overnight, the US intensified its criticism of China by issuing a new report which criticises Beijing activities. Associated Press has the details: Beyond its hard-hitting rhetoric against China over its handling of the coronavirus, the White House has issued a broad-scale attack on Beijing\u2019s predatory economic policies, military buildup, disinformation campaigns and human rights violations. The 20-page report does not signal a shift in U.S. policy, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the report and spoke only on condition of anonymity, but it expands on Trump\u2019s get-tough rhetoric that he hopes will resonate with voters angry about China\u2019s handling of the disease outbreak that has left tens of millions of Americans out of work. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has also launched a stinging attack on China\u2019s government, calling it a \u201cbrutal, authoritarian regime\u201d that is \u201cideologically and politically hostile to free nations\u201d: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just as anxiety over the Covid-19 pandemic was easing, the prospect of a new US-China trade dispute is looming over the markets again. Donald Trump has alarmed investors with another stinging attack on Beijing\u2019s handling of the pandemic -- accusing them of spreading \u201cpain and carnage\u201d around the world. He also appeared to single out president Xi Jinping personally, tweeting that \u201cit all comes from the top\u201d -- fuelling concerns that the trade deal agreed last year between the two sides could crumble. With an eye on November\u2019s election, Trump also claimed that his democratic rival Joe Biden was now China\u2019s preferred candidate. With world trade already shrinking alarmingly under the pandemic, the world economy certainly doesn\u2019t need rising tensions between these two powers. Trump\u2019s blast has rather dampened the mood in the markets, where shares yesterday hit their highest levels since early March. China\u2019s CSI 300 index has dipped 0.5%, and European stock markets have just dropped 1% at the start of trading. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: President Trump escalated rhetoric against China pointing the finger at Xi Jinping for a disinformation campaign and propaganda attacks on both the US and Europe. Whilst Trump playing the blame game with China is nothing news, this is the first time that he has taken direct aim at Xi Jinping. Previously he has always maintained a strong relationship between the two. This change of tone is making the markets sit up and listen. Riskier assets are out of favour and flows into safe havens are on the rise. Also coming up today The latest surveys of purchasing managers in the UK, US and eurozone will show how much economic damage is being caused by the lockdown - and whether business leaders are any less pessimistic about the future. These PMI reports are expected to be better than April\u2019s horror show, but still show that economies are shrinking. And brace for another shocking US unemployment report - the weekly \u2018initial claims\u2019 survey is expected to show that another 2.4 million Americans lost their jobs last week.

They do not rule over us, but rather are shepherds whose calling is to offer hope and inner depth and strength through our faith in God.</p> <p>\u201cA bewildered nation expected words of lament, of comfort, of inspiration. Alas, although they were there, they got drowned out by the micromanagement of church buildings.\u201d</p> <p>Amid protests that even clergy were forbidden from entering churches, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, insisted that <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2020/17-april/news/uk/we-have-given-guidance-not-instruction-says-welby-on-andrew-marr-show\">the C of E must \u201cset an example\u201d</a> in following the government\u2019s dictum to stay at home.</p> <p>According to Harper, a consequence of the \u201cdisorder\u201d of the Covid-19 crisis and the closure of C of E buildings has been that \u201cthe edges between church and community got lovely and smudgy and people lived their faith by loving and helping one another\u201d.</p> <p>When it came to \u201creorder\u201d after the crisis had passed, the C of E needed to look and act differently, she argued. \u201cHow I would love the church to be where every human being is loved and valued equally. Where anyone who was in any way different to the majority need never fear rejection or judgment from other Christians.</p> <p>\u201cI would love to see the choking tendrils of power, politics, entitlement, the class system to be unwrapped from around the heart of the Church of England \u2026 I would love to see us less obsessed by ourselves and more obsessed by our neighbour.\u201d</p> <p>She said the crisis had shown that the church\u2019s financial model and its commitment to a church in every parish in the country were unsustainable. \u201cThe trust of the people in a national church, already horribly compromised by its internal moral failure to treat LGBTI people, women or abuse survivors honourably, is gone forever, and its place on the national and political stage will be seriously challenged.\u201d</p> <p>Out of the crisis, a church should emerge that was \u201cmuch closer to the poorest, most marginalised in our society. More present in the housing estates across the country and less bound up in bishop\u2019s palaces and London clubs\u201d, Harper said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the Church of England\u2019s most outspoken internal critics has called for fundamental change in response to the coronavirus crisis, saying the church\u2019s self-obsession and elitism have no place in the post-virus era and that people\u2019s trust in a \u201cnational church\u201d is gone forever. The Rev Canon Rosie Harper, chaplain to the bishop of Buckingham and a member of the church\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, is among a growing number of clergy and lay members of the church voicing criticisms of the leadership\u2019s actions since the pandemic took hold in the UK. Many have been dismayed by the decision of the archbishops of Canterbury and York to tell clergy to lock churches and turn away individuals wishing to pray privately or seeking solace at a time of deep national anxiety. Writing on Via Media, a blogging site backed by some senior figures in the C of E, Harper said church leaders mimicked the government in issuing rules and regulations, \u201cforgetting that their relationship with their flock is different. They do not rule over us, but rather are shepherds whose calling is to offer hope and inner depth and strength through our faith in God. \u201cA bewildered nation expected words of lament, of comfort, of inspiration. Alas, although they were there, they got drowned out by the micromanagement of church buildings.\u201d Amid protests that even clergy were forbidden from entering churches, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, insisted that the C of E must \u201cset an example\u201d in following the government\u2019s dictum to stay at home. According to Harper, a consequence of the \u201cdisorder\u201d of the Covid-19 crisis and the closure of C of E buildings has been that \u201cthe edges between church and community got lovely and smudgy and people lived their faith by loving and helping one another\u201d. When it came to \u201creorder\u201d after the crisis had passed, the C of E needed to look and act differently, she argued. \u201cHow I would love the church to be where every human being is loved and valued equally. Where anyone who was in any way different to the majority need never fear rejection or judgment from other Christians. \u201cI would love to see the choking tendrils of power, politics, entitlement, the class system to be unwrapped from around the heart of the Church of England \u2026 I would love to see us less obsessed by ourselves and more obsessed by our neighbour.\u201d She said the crisis had shown that the church\u2019s financial model and its commitment to a church in every parish in the country were unsustainable. \u201cThe trust of the people in a national church, already horribly compromised by its internal moral failure to treat LGBTI people, women or abuse survivors honourably, is gone forever, and its place on the national and political stage will be seriously challenged.\u201d Out of the crisis, a church should emerge that was \u201cmuch closer to the poorest, most marginalised in our society. More present in the housing estates across the country and less bound up in bishop\u2019s palaces and London clubs\u201d, Harper said.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the super fund servicing retail employees has warned that the sector will not be able to invest in nation-building infrastructure and deliver good returns for their members if governments continue to allow early withdrawals by members. Rest\u2019s chief executive, Vicki Doyle, said drawdowns allowed as part of the coronavirus relief package from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, were \u201ccritically needed\u201d but that if they became a permanent feature of the superannuation system, funds such as hers would not be able to continue making long-term investments. She said the $53bn Rest was easily able to meet a flood of redemptions under the early release scheme, in part because it had unusually high levels of cash on hand before the coronavirus pandemic as insurance against risks including Brexit and Australia\u2019s high household debt levels. The early drawdown scheme allows fund members to withdraw up to $10,000 before 30 June and another $10,000 after that date. Rest has so far paid out $1bn to more than 153,000 members. Doyle said that requests were declining and the fund would easily be able to pay out the second wave of redemptions after the end of the financial year. Australian superannuation funds, especially ones in the union-and-employer-controlled industry super sector, beef up their returns by tipping money into long-term investments, such as infrastructure projects, that pay higher returns than shares or cash. However, such investments are typically more difficult and time-consuming to sell than shares, fuelling fears that allowing drawdowns would cause a liquidity crisis among super funds. \u201cIf I and the superannuation sector had to keep planning for drawdowns of such significant cash, then I\u2019d have to shorten my time horizon for investing and hold even more cash,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cIf the superannuation sector was to continue to have these mass drawdown aspects \u2026 in some ways we\u2019d look more like a bank. \u201cSo if we take a broad view of focusing on the recovery of Australia, banks can play their role and the superannuation sector can play a very significant role of trying to generate returns for members \u2013 who may now have smaller balances, by the way \u2013 but also of being a long-term investor.\u201d Doyle said total super savings looked after by Rest shrunk from $58bn to $53bn as a result of the coronavirus-inspired sharemarket meltdown, but the fund had money ready to invest in projects right now. \u201cWe are already planning to invest another $500m in agriculture that we had flagged pre-Covid and we are still going to continue on with that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we would be interested in other investments. We\u2019re currently receiving proposals into our investment committee even today around various infrastructure proposals, but I would like to see more of that.\u201d Rest is not the only industry fund itching to invest \u2013 construction industry fund Cbus has at least $2.5bn ready to go once restrictions are lifted. Doyle said: \u201cI would like to see policy settings around superannuation remain stable so that we can continue to play a role as a long-term investor.\u201d",

More broadly, the catastrophe that has befallen the leisure, retail and hospitality industry will hit under-25s hardest of all. The gloomy landscape has prompted the Resolution Foundation thinktank to call for some kind of job guarantee for the young. It is right to focus on the economic predicament of the class of 2020. But we should also be attentive to the enormous emotional strain that must come with being 18 this summer. Having left school overnight in March without properly saying goodbye, this cohort has been deprived of all the usual rites of passage and moments of catharsis: there have been no exams, no proms, no pubs and no parties. For those beginning higher education this autumn, remote learning will never offer the same opportunity to grow as a crowded university campus. Others hoping to go straight from school to the workplace will find it transformed and far less accessible. Taking a gap year will be tempting for some, but the prospects for travel are likely to be constrained, even if the money can be found. The intensity peculiar to our late teenage years, lived on the threshold of adulthood and independence, is never repeated. The government should think urgently and creatively about how to offer fulfilling opportunities and new social possibilities for a generation that is coming of age in the most testing of circumstances.",

Tegnell has denied herd immunity is a goal in itself, saying Sweden aims instead to slow the spread of the virus enough for health services to cope. But he has also said countries that imposed strict lockdowns could be more vulnerable to a second wave of infections because a smaller percentage of their populations would be immune. In April, officials estimated one third of Stockholm residents would have contracted Covid-19 by early May, subsequently suggesting that the capital could reach herd immunity of between 40% and 60% by the middle of June. Relying on citizens to act responsibly, Sweden has closed schools for the over-16s and banned gatherings of more than 50, but asked \u2013 rather than ordered \u2013 people to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and stay at home if they are elderly or ill. Shops, restaurants and gyms have remained open. Polls show a large majority of Swedes support and are generally complying with their government\u2019s more relaxed, less coercive strategy, which stands in stark contrast to the strict mandatory lockdowns imposed by many EU countries. Google records suggest trips to shops and cafes by residents of the Stockholm area are down 20%-40%, while passenger numbers on public transport have fallen by 30%-40%. But the approach has been heavily criticised by some Swedish academics as the number of coronavirus deaths in the country has risen, far exceeding those of its Nordic neighbours. While the overall coronavirus death rate per million is greater in Italy (535), Spain (597) or the UK (538), Sweden\u2019s (376) is far in advance of Norway\u2019s (44), Denmark\u2019s (96) and Finland\u2019s (55) \u2013 countries with similar welfare systems and demographics, but which imposed strict lockdowns. According to the scientific online publication Ourworldindata.com, Covid-19 deaths in Sweden were the highest in Europe per capita in a rolling seven-day average between 12 and 19 May. The country\u2019s 6.25 deaths per million inhabitants a day was just above the UK\u2019s 5.75. The government\u2019s decision to avoid a strict lockdown is thought unlikely to spare the Swedish economy. Although retail and entertainment spending has not collapsed quite as dramatically as elsewhere, analysts say the country will probably not reap any long-term economic benefit. The European commission has said it expects Sweden\u2019s gross domestic product to contract by more than 6% this year, on a par with much of the continent, while the country\u2019s central bank has estimated an even sharper fall of 7%-10%, with unemployment forecast to rise to as much as 10.4%. The World Health Organization has warned against pinning hopes on herd immunity as a means of containing the coronavirus, saying last week that studies had found antibodies in only 1%-10% of the global population. Critics such as Olsen say Sweden has done \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d and note that the government\u2019s laissez-faire approach has been catastrophic for older people, with roughly half the country\u2019s 3,831 deaths so far occurring in care homes. Tegnell\u2019s predecessor as chief epidemiologist, Annika Linde, told Dagens Nyheter this week that the country\u2019s strategy towards care homes had been \u201ccompletely insufficient. The problems were underestimated. It was a clear misjudgment.\u201d The government has admitted serious failings in care homes and this month announced a big increase in funding for the sector, but remains adamant that the country\u2019s relatively high number of deaths per capita is not a consequence of its decision not to impose a lockdown. In other coronavirus developments around the world: Media in Iran reported that more than 10,000 healthcare workers have been infected, as health officials in war-ravaged Yemen and Gaza expressed mounting concern about waves of new cases. China, where the virus originated, opened its biggest political event of the year, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, after months of delay. Another 2.4 million US workers filed for unemployment insurance last week, meaning close to 39 million people in the US have lost their jobs in just nine weeks. A quarter of US citizens have little or no interest in taking a coronavirus vaccine, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 36% saying they would be less willing to take a vaccine if Donald Trump said it was safe. The pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca said it had capacity to produce 1bn doses of University of Oxford\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine and will begin supply in September if clinical trials are successful. Experts warned South Africa could have up to 50,000 Covid-19 deaths and as many as 3 million infections by the end of the year. The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) warned that the Tokyo Games would have to be scrapped if they were not held next year. The official number of coronavirus deaths in Russia reached 3,099. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry said it had run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in most parts of the war-torn country. Japan\u2019s prime minister said a state of emergency in Tokyo and its surrounding regions could end as early as next week. Reuters contributed reporting",

Zhang announced that delegates at the NPC \u2013 a largely rubber-stamping exercise \u2013 would \u201cestablish and improve a legal framework and mechanism for safeguarding national security\u201d in Hong Kong. Condemnation of the proposal was swift, amid fears it could erase the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that is supposed to grant the territory a high degree of autonomy. \u201cThis is the end of Hong Kong,\u201d said pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator Dennis Kwok. \u201cBeijing, the Central People\u2019s Government, has completely breached its promise to the Hong Kong people ...

      "bodyText": "The UK competition watchdog is investigating package holiday firms after receiving thousands of complaints from consumers who have been unable to recoup money on cancelled breaks. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had received 60,000 complaints related to the coronavirus crisis, including difficulties getting money back and price rises. Holiday firms and airlines were the subject of almost 27,000 of the complaints, and those businesses accounted for three-quarters of the submissions involving cancellations and refunds. The CMA said package holiday firms would be added to the list of businesses its Covid-19 taskforce was investigating. It said it had concerns about firms that refused refunds, made it difficult for consumers to obtain refunds, or insisted that consumers rebook or accept vouchers. If firms were found not to be complying with the law, they could be taken to court, the CMA added. The lockdown has forced hotels and holiday parks to close and prevented people from travelling to planned breaks. The CMA said that in most cases it would expect customers to be offered a full refund if the service they had booked was not provided, including when the customer had cancelled themselves if it was due to the lockdown. In many cases, holidaymakers have been told that deposits are unrefundable, or that they need to make a special request if they want a refund rather than a voucher. Many are struggling to get through to customer service teams, whose members are working from home and are often short-staffed. The CMA said that with summer holiday season approaching, \u201cthe potential harm to consumers from companies failing to respect consumers\u2019 cancellation rights is set to grow\u201d. It has referred complaints about airlines to the Civil Aviation Authority, which oversees those companies. The CAA is separately reviewing the way that airlines are treating their customers, and last week warned them that it did not \u201cexpect airlines to systematically deny consumers their right to a refund\u201d. In late April, the CMA said it would be investigating firms providing holiday accommodation along with those in the wedding and childcare sectors. In its update, it had opened cases against some companies in those sectors. The CMA stressed that most businesses were doing the right thing, saying that complaints related to just over 16,000 individual private-sector businesses in the UK. \u201cThe vast majority of businesses are behaving in a reasonable way, but the CMA will not hesitate to take enforcement action if there is evidence that businesses have breached competition or consumer protection law,\u201d it said. Between 11 and 17 May, an average of 1,200 people a day got in touch to make a complaint, of which about 850 involved cancellations and refunds. Most of the rest involved price rises, typically on food and drink or hygiene-related products. The CMA said the largest price increases reported to it concerned hand sanitiser, with a reported median rise of just under 400%. The travel sector has been hard hit by the crisis, with the accountancy group UHY Hacker Young saying average turnover among agencies and tour operators slumped by 56% in March. Total turnover was \u00a31.2bn that month, compared with \u00a32.6bn last March, it said, adding that companies had faced cancellations at what would have been some of the highest-revenue points in their calendar.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson was forced into the first major U-turn of his premiership on Thursday, as he announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. The prime minister had faced escalating tension from within his own ranks on the fee, after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, raised the issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Tory MPs and peers told Johnson the policy was \u201cmean-spirited and immoral\u201d and that he risked a humiliating rebellion on a Labour amendment to the immigration bill. Amid fears that the government had backed itself into a corner, and with emotional appeals from NHS staff and care workers emerging online and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt voicing his opposition, government sources briefed that the prime minister was \u201cthinking hard\u201d about the surcharge \u2013 and it was dropped shortly before 5pm. The reversal, hailed as a \u201cvictory for common decency\u201d by Starmer, was introduced just hours before the prime minister was expected to take part in the weekly Clap for Our Carers event, which had been highlighted by critics as an example of government hypocrisy. It brings to an end a controversy that has run for almost a month, since the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the policy was under review \u2013 only for the Home Office to subsequently row back on the pledge, saying: \u201cAll government policies are continuously kept under review.\u201d After the row came to a head, Downing Street said Johnson had considered the issue \u201ca great deal\u201d and understood the difficulties faced by NHS workers before giving the green light for a policy change. \u201cThe prime minister has asked the Home Office and the Department for Social Care to remove NHS and care workers from the surcharge as soon as possible,\u201d a spokesperson said.

Former Conservative cabinet minister David Mundell said the shift was the right thing for Johnson\u2019s government to do. \u201cIt was inconsistent with the deep gratitude everyone feels for NHS staff at this time,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, former Conservative party vice-chair and MP for North Thanet, Sir Roger Gale, said it would \u201crightly be perceived as mean-spirited\u201d, while Andrew Boff, a senior Tory on the Greater London assembly, said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my party, but this is not its finest hour. These people have saved lives, then we give them a bill.\u201d The former Tory party chair Chris Patten said the fee would be \u201cimmoral and monstrous\u201d. Another senior Tory, Bob Neill, chair of the justice select committee, said the charge was \u201ca small sum in the overall scheme of things\u201d and the government should show generosity of spirit as a nation. Tory MPs in Scotland and London were said to be very uneasy with the fee as they are the regions that rely most heavily on migrant labour in the healthcare sector and where immigration policies can be hard to defend. The Royal College of Nursing had also wanted health workers to be exempt from the \u201cunfair\u201d charge. So far during the crisis, 181 health service and 131 care staff have died, according to government figures. The reversal is being viewed as a victory for Starmer. Following the announcement, he called the decision \u201cthe right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next.\u201d",

<li><strong>Migrant health and care workers to be exempt from NHS surcharge after U-turn</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Downing Street has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">bowed to concerted pressure</a> from the opposition and Conservative backbenchers to scrap the NHS surcharge for migrant health and care workers.</p> \n  <p>After backbenchers including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government\u2019s position, a No 10 spokesman said Boris Johnson had asked the Home Office and the Department for Health and Social Care to remove NHS and care workers from the scheme as soon as possible.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock, the health secretary, confirmed the government will roll out antibody testing next week, having signed contracts for 10m tests</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Antibody tests show

Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also came out to pay her respects tonight. According to the BBC, \u201cmillions of people\u201d were clapping across the country tonight, among them 100-year-old Dabirul Choudhury, from St Albans, who\u2019s raised over \u00a3177,000 for coronavirus relief. On my street in central Brixton, London, only two parties came to their windows to clap for about 15 seconds tonight. In previous weeks, people could be seen in most windows clapping and cheering. Here a video that was posted by the British Medical Association in Scotland: Boris Johnson came out of No 10 for a solo clap tonight, without his fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds, who had accompanied him last week. This from London Mayor Sadiq Khan: This just in from Forces News, showing military staff in Bosnia, Turks and Caicos and Cornwall clapping for carers. This from Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting. People across the UK will pay tribute to coronavirus key workers tonight at 8pm BST. Every Thursday for the past nine weeks, people have been clapping from their doorsteps, windows and streets for NHS staff, bus drivers, retail staff and other key workers who have been risking their lives by going to work during the pandemic. Tonight\u2019s Clap for Carers will go ahead against the backdrop of the government\u2019s scrapping of the NHS surcharge for migrant health and care workers, a U-turn that came on Thursday after pressure from opposition and Conservative backbenchers. Daily summary Here are the main points from today. Migrant health and care workers to be exempt from NHS surcharge after U-turn Downing Street has bowed to concerted pressure from the opposition and Conservative backbenchers to scrap the NHS surcharge for migrant health and care workers. After backbenchers including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government\u2019s position, a No 10 spokesman said Boris Johnson had asked the Home Office and the Department for Health and Social Care to remove NHS and care workers from the scheme as soon as possible. Hancock, the health secretary, confirmed the government will roll out antibody testing next week, having signed contracts for 10m tests Antibody tests show whether or not people have had coronavirus.Hancock said: \u201cWe\u2019ve signed contracts to supply in the coming months over 10 million tests from Roche and Abbott. From next week we will begin rolling these out in a phased way, at first to health and care staff, patients and residents. \u201cThe UK government has arranged supplies of these tests on behalf of the devolved administrations and each devolved nation is deciding how to use its test allocation and how testing will be prioritised and managed locally. \u201cThis is an important milestone and it represents further progress in our national testing programme.\u201d Hancock says 17% of Londoners may have had coronavirus He says antibody tests suggest that 17% of people in London may have had coronavirus. In the rest of the country the figure is 5%, he says. UK records a further 338 coronavirus deaths, taking total to 36,042. The latest UK figures reveal that 36,042 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Wednesday, up by 338 from 35,704 the day before. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Thursday, 128,340 tests were carried out or dispatched, with a total of 67,681 people tested and 2,615 positive results. A total of 3,090,566 tests have been carried out, and 250,908 cases have been confirmed positive. Excess deaths in care homes during the coronavirus pandemic have peaked and \u201ccome down a long way\u201d, England\u2019s chief medical officer has confirmed. Prof Chris Whitty said there was a clear peak in excess deaths in hospitals in early April in England and Wales, followed by care homes. The government adviser told the Downing Street press conference: \u201cIf you look at care homes, the other thing which people are rightly very concerned about... the care home deaths have peaked and come down a long way. \u201cBut that peak was slightly later - one to two weeks after the peak in hospitals.\u201d Whitty said figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the excess deaths in care homes compared to the five-year average fell from 4,331 to 2,247 in the week ending 8 May. Earlier this week, Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, told the health and social care committee he thought care homes were \u201cprobably at the top of the curve\u201d in Covid-19 cases. One of the new coronavirus antibody tests to be rolled out across the UK is being produced in south Wales. It is understood that Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, which has a factory in Pencoed, Bridgend, is the only firm producing the blood tests in the UK. On Thursday, Wales\u2019 health minister, Vaughan Gething, welcomed news of the test, which will be available from Ortho and other suppliers across the UK, saying it was an \u201cimportant step forward\u201d in stopping the spread of Covid-19. He said: \u201cThis test will tell us if people have already had coronavirus. But it is important to say, although the test can tell if someone has had the virus, it\u2019s not certain as to how much immunity they\u2019ll have to the virus.\u201d Gething said work was being done in Wales to develop another type of antibody test involving taking a pinprick of blood and testing it with a device to give a result in just minutes, which would help to make antibody testing more widely available. The US firm Ortho has had a site in Pencoed for 40 years and employs more than 500 people. It produces millions of tests each week for a range of diseases and medical conditions which are distributed around the world. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s press conference. The health and social care secretary confirmed that the government would roll out antibody testing next week, having signed contracts for 10m tests. Antibody tests show whether people have had coronavirus. He said: We\u2019ve signed contracts to supply in the coming months over 10 million tests from Roche and Abbott. From next week we will begin rolling these out in a phased way, at first to health and care staff, patients and residents. The UK government has arranged supplies of these tests on behalf of the devolved administrations and each devolved nation is deciding how to use its test allocation and how testing will be prioritised and managed locally. This is an important milestone and it represents further progress in our national testing programme. Hancock said a certification system would be developed for people who tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. He said: Knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus. We\u2019re developing this critical science to know the impact of a positive antibody test and to develop the systems of certification to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurances of what they can safely do. He said an antibody surveillance study suggests that 17% of people in London have had coronavirus. In the rest of the country the figure is 5% or higher, he said. He announced that a coronavirus test that can provide a result in 20 minutes is being piloted. He played down suggestions that Boris Johnson had changed his stance on the NHS surcharge for migrant health and care workers. Asked why Johnson yesterday defended migrant care workers paying the charge, only to announce today that they will be exempted, Hancock said that when the prime minister was speaking in the Commons yesterday, he was defending the policy as a whole, not its application to care and NHS workers. Prof John Newton, from Public Health England, the government\u2019s testing coordinator, claimed it might be best to introduce the national contact-tracing system without the app. He was responding to a question from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby who said the government\u2019s recovery plan document said an app would be integral to a successful contact-tracing system. (See 5.41pm.) Newton said the app was an \u201cadditional component\u201d which could be \u201clayered on top of the more personal contact tracing\u201d by officials. He went on: They are distinct but complementary, it\u2019s perfectly OK - in fact possibly advantageous - to introduce the one before the other. Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical adviser, said the rate of all-cause excess deaths was now down to the average for a winter. He explained: All-cause mortality has come down at the same time as the Covid deaths have come down and it is now at roughly the rate it is at in an average winter. So, we are essentially having a winter in health terms, in terms of mortality, but in late spring and early summer. Whitty said the peak of deaths in care homes came one or two weeks after the peak of deaths in hospitals. There has been a surge in paid users on Facebook\u2019s business platform after home working rose due to the pandemic. The social networks business-focused platform has gained 2 million paid users in little over six months. Workplace from Facebook, the tech giant\u2019s communication offering for companies and employees, has more than 5 million paid users, up from 3 million in October last year. The firm said it was introducing a number of new features as businesses turned to home working during the lockdown and looked to continue remote working in the future. Workplace Rooms is a collaborative video chat tool to take on the likes of Zoom, and its Workplace Live Video feature is receiving a number of improvements to provide better production value, control and interactivity. Meanwhile, Oculus for Business is available to all those who wish to use virtual reality for productivity and collaboration in the workplace. Workplace from Facebook - which is largely run from London - launched in October 2016 and started charging customers a year later. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, daily figures from the Ministry of Justice show. As of 5pm on Wednesday, 434 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 75 prisons, a 0.5% increase in 24 hours, while there were 563 infected prison staff across 74 prisons, an increase of 1% in the same period. There are around 80,300 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, while around 33,000 staff work in the public sector prisons. At least 21 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, as well as nine prison staff, including one Pecs worker. A London choir has got together for a virtual performance after a planned show in Somerset was cancelled due to Covid-19. Hi Lo Singers, from north-east London, performed a mash-up of Blackbird and I Will by the Beatles while they were unable to meet for rehearsals. The musical director Geoff Walker asked each of the singers involved in the project to film their part at home, with the videos then being edited together. The last time the singers met in person was in early March, when they rehearsed for their scheduled performance at Wells Cathedral in Somerset. Emma Secher, one of the choir\u2019s founders, said: \u201cOur singers are a great bunch of people. One of them is an ICU doctor. \u201cA few of our singers have been ill with symptoms of the virus over the last weeks, so it was even more special to get everyone together. \u201cWe plan to do a children\u2019s virtual choir next.\u201d The Conservative MP Robert Halfon has also welcomed the No 10 U-turn on the NHS surcharge. He was one of the Tories who called for this move. Q: [From an Edinburgh journalist] From August employers will have to contribute to the cost of furlough. But the hospitality sector won\u2019t be opening up then. So will they get extra help? Hancock says he understands the specific concern, particularly for a city like Edinburgh that is so dependent on the festival. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Robbie Savage, former footballer and a columnist from the Daily Mirror, goes next. Q: Why are young people who play the working class game of football not able to train, when people can play sport like tennis? Hancock says he understands why people want to play football. But the rules are in place so we can get a grip of the virus. Q: Why are some governing bodies allowing one-on-one coaching with under-18s, but not football? Whitty says he understands the point. He says the scientists were very confident that doing things outdoors is safer than indoors. He says you can play some sports and keep to the two-metre rule. But football is a contact sport, he says. So football is a bigger risk. He says the experts have had to think about what the reproduction rate for the infection has to be for this to be safe. Q: So what is the pathway to grassroots football being allowed to restart? Will we have to wait for a vaccine? Hancock says he very much hopes not. Whitty says his expectation is that a vaccine before next year on a widespread basis is very unlikely. He says there may have to be some changes to the way football is played. But he hopes football can be played. Outdoors is safer than indoors. Q: Is there a point where contact tracing will not be able to work because there are too many cases? Hancock says, because of the surveillance system, they now have a much better idea of what R is. So they should be able to prevent that, he says. Q: If we never needed the app to launch a contact-tracing system, could we not have launched the contact-tracing system earlier? Hancock says the app is working in the Isle of Wight. But rolling it out nationwide will be harder, he says. Q: The government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan says an app is integral to a contact-tracing system. Now you are not saying that. Why? (Here is a quote from the document. It says \u201cFor such a [contact tracing] system to work, several systems need to be built and successfully integrated. These include .... automated, app-based contact-tracing through the new NHS Covid-19 app.) Hancock says the contact-tracing system must be in place by 1 June. There are 24,000 contact tracers, as of yesterday. The technology is an important part, but not the only part, he says. Q: Yesterday the PM said it was right to make migrant care workers pay the NHS surcharge. Now he says that\u2019s wrong. What changed his mind? Hancock says yesterday the PM was talking about the surcharge in general. (See 4.46pm.) Now he is talking about exemptions, he says. Q: Did the PM change his mind on exempting care workers from the NHS surcharge, or was he just worried about losing votes? Hancock says the PM has asked him and the home secretary to look at how NHS and care workers can be removed from this as soon as possible. He says the purpose of the surcharge was a fair one; to ensure that everyone contributes to the NHS. Q: Are you still planning to impose a cap on the amount of social care costs any individual has to pay? And has the crisis strengthened the case for reform? Hancock says the government is working on creating a sustainable care system, as it promised in its manifesto. Q: When will that emerge? And will it stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care? Hancock says it will stop people having to sell their homes. He has seen the injustice of this. People cannot insure themselves against this risk, he says. But he says he can\u2019t say when the care plan will be published. Hancock is now addressing a question from Finlay, a member of the public. Will the vaccine be compulsory? Hancock says the government will only recommend a vaccine if it is safe. And so if the government recommends it, people should use it. He says he is not addressing the issue of compulsion now. But he would hope that everyone would want to use it. Whitty says you can use vaccines to protect a whole population, or you can give it to those most at risk. You might do this because there are limited supplies, or because it only provides partial protection. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, is presenting the slides now. Here are the figures from the ONS for the number of people with coronavirus now. And this chart shows excess deaths. Whitty says he has repeatedly said excess deaths is the best measure of the seriousness of the pandemic. He says you can see the peak. Now it is coming down to the level of a normal winter flu oubreak \u2013 albeit winter levels in spring or early summer. Hancock says the antibody tests suggest that 17% of people in London may have had coronavirus. In the rest of the country the figure is 5%, he says. He says the government has signed a deal with Roche and Abbott that will lead to 10m antibody tests being available in the UK. He says these will be rolled out to NHS and care staff and patients first. Hancock is now reading out the latest testing and death figures. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, is taking the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. He starts by talking about mental health. It is OK to say you are stressed, he says. He urges people to come together for Mental Health Awareness Week. This is from William Wragg, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. He was one of the first Conservatives to say he would support a Labour proposal to exempt all migrant health and care workers from the NHS surcharge. (See 8.33am.) No 10 has clarified that the new policy, removing all migrant NHS and care workers from the NHS surcharge, will cover \u201call NHS workers, ranging from medical health staff including vital porters and cleaners\u201d. It also includes independent health workers and social care workers. For migrants working outside the health and social care industry, the NHS surcharge will remain in place, and the planned increase, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624, will go ahead in October. \u201cIt is fair to expect people arriving in the UK to work in non-health roles who might use the NHS to make a contribution,\u201d a government source said. In March, Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced a limited exemption from the NHS surcharge for NHS workers. She said that around 2,800 migrant doctors, nurses and paramedics would have their visas extended for free for a year, and that they would not have to pay the NHS surcharge. Under the new No 10 policy (see 4.37pm) NHS and care workers seem to be getting a permanent exemption. This is from Sir Keir Starmer. The No 10 U-turn marks a victory for Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader raised the issue at PMQs yesterday and challenged Boris Johnson to remove it for care workers. Johnson said he had \u201cthought a great deal about this\u201d, but he defended the arrangements. Starmer said: Every Thursday, we go out and clap for our carers. Many of them are risking their lives for the sake of all of us. Does the prime minister think it is right that careworkers coming from abroad and working on our frontline should have to pay a surcharge of hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds to use the NHS themselves? And Johnson replied: I have thought a great deal about this, and I accept and understand the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. Like [Starmer] I have been a personal beneficiary of carers who have come from abroad and frankly saved my life. I know exactly the importance of what he asks. On the other hand, we must look at the realities. This is a great national service \u2013 it is a national institution \u2013 that needs funding, and those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900m. It is very difficult in the current circumstances to find alternative sources, so with great respect for [Starmer\u2019s] point, I think it is the right way forward. U-turns are always embarrassing for politicians, particularly when they are as blatant as this one. But, in the long-term, they can be beneficial. Opposition parties need grievances; U-turns sweep those grievances off the table. Downing Street has now performed a U-turn on the NHS surcharge, and announced that all migrant NHS and care workers will join the health workers already benefitting from an exemption. A No 10 spokesman put out this statement. The PM has asked the Home Office and the Department for Health and Social Care to remove NHS and care workers from the NHS surcharge as soon as possible. Work by officials is now under way on how to implement the change and full details will be announced in the coming days. As the PM said in the House of Commons, he has been thinking about this a great deal. He been a personal beneficiary of carers from abroad and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. The purpose of the NHS surcharge is to benefit the NHS, help to care for the sick and save lives. NHS and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make. You can read the full story here: According to a snap YouGov poll, by a margin of almost two to one, people think migrant health and care workers should be exempt from the NHS surcharge. Even among Conservative supporters there is a small majority in favour of the exemption (although not among those who are pro-Brexit). But if you were wondering why Downing Street seems reluctant to give in to the pressure for a U-turn on this, another finding from the poll provides an answer \u2013 overall, the NHS surcharge is massively popular. Even Labour supporters are in favour, the poll suggests. UPDATE: It is worth pointing out that this YouGov question is misleading because it ignores the fact that migrant workers do pay for the NHS through their taxes. But the idea that they don\u2019t is implicit in the policy; in fact, it is the whole rationale for the policy (which is why many people find it so objectionable). The number of frontline prison officers fell in the first three months of the year, figures from the Ministry of Justice show, prompting warnings against \u201cflashpoints\u201d developing in jails. As at the end of March, there were 21,928 prison officers working in bands 3 to 5 \u2013 frontline officers \u2013 226 fewer than at the end of December, 702 fewer than in March 2019, and 2,902 fewer than at the end of March 2010. Experts have warned prisons could be potential hotspots for the coronavirus and the government has introduced a highly restrictive regime in an attempt to contain the spread of disease behind bars. At least 21 prisoners and nine staff have contracted the virus and died. The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, said: It is extremely worrying that the number of frontline prison staff is dropping in the middle of a pandemic. Understaffing and overcrowding in prisons can lead to disorder and put staff at risk. With tensions already high due to the severe emergency regime imposed in response to Covid-19, the government is at risk of allowing flashpoints to develop. In normal times these statistics would be concerning, but in the context of the pandemic they could seriously undermine the ability of prisons to follow the correct public health response. The Conservatives have criticised Labour politicians in the London assembly for pressing ahead with an investigation into Boris Johnson and his dealings with Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor. (See 12.16pm.) In a statement issued by CCHQ, the Tory MP Gareth Bacon said: Labour politicians in City Hall have wasted police time with malicious complaints. They now want to waste taxpayers\u2019 money with more petty and partisan point scoring. This is a smokescreen to cover up Sadiq Khan\u2019s lamentable record as mayor. They should do their job and start investigating Khan\u2019s failure to deal with the violent crime epidemic, failure to build enough houses and incompetent handling of TfL\u2019s finances. The hymn Abide With Me, sung just before every FA Cup final since the early 20th century, will belted out once more this Saturday in aid of NHS charities. Before what would have been kick-off at Wembley for the 2020 cup final, an online recording of the song will be broadcast across the internet. The annual climax to the English football season in May was one of the sporting casualties of the Covid-19 lockdown. Members of the Fans Choir, who sang Abide With Me\u2019 at the Arsenal v Aston Villa final in 2015, have teamed up again to release Abide With Us\u2019 in solidarity with NHS staff fighting the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re all footy mad and missing our singing!\u201d said Dave Gilhooley, who has compiled the video from Fans Choir members\u2019 contributions from all over the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for fans all over the country to sing your footy socks off on your doorstep for the game that you love, the NHS and key workers that have sacrificed so much on our behalf. \u201cA Just Giving page has been set up, the aim being to raise money for NHS families decimated by losing a loved one to the dreadful C-19 disease,\u201d he added. A cafe owner who installed dozens of shower curtains between tables in a bid to combat coronavirus has said he hopes his idea can inspire other businesses. Francini Osorio has used more than 30 curtains as dividers between tables in a trial phase during the Covid-19 lockdown and has more on order. Osorio also plans to use an air purifier in an effort to protect customers at the Francini Cafe De Colombia in Worcester. The businessman, originally from Colombia, who is readying his cafe to reopen, said: \u201cWhere I come from we don\u2019t sink, we stand up and we keep going.\u201d Osorio, who plans to provide gloves and encourage people to bring their own masks, said of the curtains, which will be sprayed with disinfectant: \u201cThe idea is to keep people together but separated by the curtain. \u201cIf this has inspired people, that\u2019s brilliant.\u201d A ban on a mosque opening for Friday prayers due to the Covid-19 pandemic is a breach of worshippers\u2019 human rights, the high court has heard. Tabassum Hussain, the chairman of the executive committee of the Jamiyat Tabligh-ul-Islam Mosque, one of the largest mosques in Bradford, is seeking an urgent injunction against the Department of Health and Social Care. The injunction would allow his place of worship to open for communal prayers on Friday, before the end of Ramadan this weekend. Under the latest emergency rules to deal with the pandemic, places of worship must remain closed, although a faith leader can attend the venue to broadcast prayers and acts of worship via the internet. Hussain argues that the closures are unlawful and breach his rights to religious freedom and worship. In another easing of the lockdown in England, the Department for Education has said that students who had to abandon their belongings in university accommodation can now go and get them. In new guidance issued today, the DfE told universities to contact the students affected: We are advising students who left their student accommodation and now wish to travel back to recover their belongings that they may do so as long as they follow the precautions laid out in staying safe outside your home. We encourage you to enable your students to collect their belongings from your accommodation in England in a way that minimises the risk of coronavirus infection. There\u2019s a slight sting in the tail: students who can\u2019t go \u2013 because they are isolating or perhaps living overseas \u2013 may find their belongings put into storage for a price. \u201cIf there are costs to you in carrying out this service, we understand students may be required to cover these costs but we would not expect you to make a profit from such a service,\u201d the DfE told universities. A Liberal Democrat peer has admitted making an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d after furloughing himself while continuing to claim a three-figure daily allowance for his work in parliament. Christopher Fox decided to furlough himself as the owner and sole employee of Vulpes Advisory, a communications and consultancy company, but continued to collect his daily \u00a3162 allowance for carrying out his work virtually as a peer in the House of Lords. Lord Fox has now confirmed he will repay the money he received during his time on furlough. The 62-year-old said: \u201cI recognise my error in judgment and I apologise. \u201cI have already begun to repay the money I received as part of the furlough scheme and intend to repay the full amount as soon as possible.\u201d Fox, who is reported to own two homes worth more than \u00a32m, is the first parliamentarian to have used the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme to pay himself, according to the Telegraph. The millionaire former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham reversed her decision to furlough staff at her fashion label after facing a backlash. Meanwhile, the comic and actor Steve Coogan, estimated to be worth \u00a310m, has furloughed his gardener and housekeeper at his \u00a34m country home, according to the Sun. Nicola Sturgeon has announced people in Scotland will be allowed to meet friends outdoors, sunbathe and start shopping at garden centres from 28 May as she unveiled the slow easing of the lockdown. The first minister told MSPs she wanted to see a suitably cautious lifting of some lockdown restrictions from next Thursday mirroring the relaxations already announced in other parts of the UK. Sturgeon confirmed outdoor sports such as tennis and golf could restart next week and people could visit nearby parks and beauty spots. Outdoor cafes, recycling centres and drive-through restaurants will also be permitted to reopen as part of the four-step plan she outlined for easing the lockdown. She said all Scotland\u2019s schools would reopen from 11 August with a \u201cblended model\u201d of part-time teaching in school and at home, with teachers going back to school from June to start preparing their classrooms. From June, children moving from primary school to secondary school this summer would also be given help with the transition to secondary school. She added, however, that tight restrictions on allowing relatives and friends to gather at funerals, and the ban on bars and hairdressers from reopening, would not be relaxed for at least three weeks. The latest UK figures reveal that 36,042 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in as of 5pm on Wednesday, up by 338 from 35,704 the day before. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Thursday, 128,340 tests were carried out or dispatched, with a total of 67,681 people tested and 2,615 positive results. A total of 3,090,566 tests have been carried out, and 250,908 cases have been confirmed positive. The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman effectively confirmed that the contact-tracing app will not be ready when the government launches its national test and trace scheme for 1 June. The spokesman said the app would be ready in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d. He went on: There is certainly no requirement to have the app in order to have an effective trace and system, which the PM spoke about, in place by June 1. Asked why the app, which is being piloted on the Isle of Wight, would not be ready for national rollout by the end of May, as originally planned, the spokesman said: The whole point of a pilot is to identify any issues with it in order that they can be ironed out. That work is ongoing. The spokesman said there were no plans to review the NHS surcharge for migrants and that the planned increase, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624, would go ahead in October. The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice tomorrow on the safety of schools opening. The latest estimate of R, the reproduction number, will be published too. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, is due to give details at the daily press conference this afternoon about the rollout of coronavirus antibody tests, which follows negotiations between the government and the pharmaceutical firm Roche, the spokesman said. NHS and care workers will be prioritised for the free tests, the spokesman said. The spokesman said Boris Johnson would consider travel advice before deciding whether or not to attend an in-person G7 summit that Donald Trump is reportedly planning. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to 501, after seven more deaths were reported by the Department of Health. The full details are here. And Public Health Wales said a further nine people had died there after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,247. Another 166 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 12,846. The full details are here. Hello, I am currently updating the UK blog. Please send any tips and stories to nazia.parveen@theguardian.com or follow me on Twitter to message me https://twitter.com/NParveenG. In the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon has now finished taking questions on the Scottish government\u2019s routemap for easing the lockdown (pdf). She said that 100,000 people had already tried to download it, with the result that the Scottish government\u2019s website had been having problems. She urged people to be patient. They would be able to download it later if they could not now, she said. A frontbench peer has apologised for furloughing himself while also claiming a Lords \u00a3162 daily attendance allowance. Christopher Fox was forced to issue the apology after it was revealed that he had furloughed himself despite claiming the daily House of Lords allowance during lockdown. Fox said: \u201cI recognise my error in judgment and I apologise. I have already begun to repay the money I received as part of the furlough scheme and intend to repay the full amount.\u201d The Conservative backbenchers Henry Smith has outraged opposition parliamentarians by saying that the objection to MPs returning to the House of Commons after next week\u2019s recess (when the current, largely-virtual proceedings will end) has come from the \u201clazy left\u201d and from \u201cworkshy\u201d Labour and nationalist politicians. Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips was one of the MPs who condemned Smith on Twitter. And a Labour party spokesperson said: The government\u2019s own public health advice has said that those who can work from home should and parliament has developed a system using technology to ensure the scrutiny of government whilst allowing people to work remotely. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, told the London assembly this morning that he is considering banning passengers from buses and tube trains in the capital if they are not wearing a face covering. He said that he was hoping to persuade the UK government, which is currently just advising people to wear face coverings on public transport, to toughen its stance. He told the assembly: We don\u2019t want confusion. When there is a crisis, what\u2019s important is to have message clarity. He said that he was hoping to persuade the government \u201cto do the right thing\u201d. But, if that did not happen, he said next week he would consider using the powers he has as mayor to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory on Transport for London tubes and buses. The Conservative peer Chris Patten (see 11.53am) and the public administration committee chair William Wragg (see 8.33am) are not the only Tories calling for migrant care workers to be exempt from the NHS surcharge. In the Evening Standard Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil have rounded up some more rebels on this issue, including Bob Neill, the justice committee chair, Robert Halfon, the education committee chair, and Sir Roger Gale, a former party vice chairman. Gale said that not waiving the surcharge would \u201crightly be perceived as mean-spirited, doctrinaire and petty\u201d. The number of people moving to the UK long term from non-EU countries has hit a new record high, according to the latest estimates. As PA Media reports, last year immigration from non-EU countries rose to 404,000, the highest it has ever been since records began in 1975 when it was 93,000, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows. Net migration from outside the EU, the balance between the number of people entering and leaving the country, is also at its highest level (282,000) since citizenship information was first collected in 1975 (40,000). Both figures have continued to rise since 2013. Meanwhile, EU net migration fell to 49,000, down from 75,000 recorded a year earlier and after hitting peaks of more than 200,000 in 2015. Downing Street has described the complaint about Boris Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as a waste of police time. Responding to the news that the IOPC is not launching a criminal inquiry (see 11.45am), a spokesman for the prime minister said: We welcome the fact that this politically motivated complaint has been thrown out. Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded. An independent review by the government internal audit agency similarly showed the claims made by the Labour party were false. This was not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time. Sturgeon says universities and colleges should have a phased return next term. On schools, she says today she has published a report from the education recovery group. All schools in Scotland will re-open from 11 August, Sturgeon says. Pupils will get \u201ca blended model of part time in-school and part time at-home learning\u201d. Sturgeon says that the Scottish government will produce new guidance for the extremely clinically vulnerable people who have been told to shield (ie, not leave home). This will be out by 18 June, she says. Sturgeon gives details of what will be allowed from 28 May. In her speech Sturgeon says that she expects the phase one measures to come in from 28 May. But not every phase 1 measure will come in on that day, she says. Here is a chart from the document (pdf) explaining the four phases. And here is a chart showing how the rules on meeting people and travel will change as Scotland moves into the next phases. These are two of the nine charts in the annex to the document explaining in detail what will be allowed at different stages. Sturgeon says there are now an estimated 25,000 infected people in Scotland. But there has been a significant and sustained reduction, she says. She says the government now estimates the R number (the reproduction number, the rate at which the virus is spreading) at between 0.7 and 1. She says in March it was thought to be above four. But now it is thought to have been below 1 for three weeks, which means she feels able to set out the next steps for easing the lockdown, she says. Sturgeon is now setting out the latest daily figures. She says 51 people were in intensive care last night with coronavirus. There have been a further 37 deaths, she says, taking the total to 2,221. Sturgeon says the routemap has just been published. It\u2019s here (pdf). She says it will be supplemented by further documents in due course. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is about to make a statement to the Scottish parliament about the routemap her government is publishing today for easing the lockdown. (See 11.16am.) The London assembly has said it will resume its investigation into Boris Johnson after the IOPC ruled against undertaking a criminal investigation over his ties to US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri while he was London mayor. (See 11.45am.) Len Duvall, the Greater London authority\u2019s oversight committee chair, said: The IOPC was looking specifically at whether he committed a criminal offence. That\u2019s not our remit and their decision doesn\u2019t have any real bearing on our investigation, which will focus on his conduct as mayor of London. Everyone who holds public office, whether you\u2019re the mayor of London, or indeed the prime minister, is expected to adhere to the principles of public life - including integrity, selflessness, openness and honesty, to name a few. Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that\u2019s expected from anyone in that position. It\u2019s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable. The oversight committee will take into account the current emergency when looking at the timetable for the investigation. Chris Patten, the former Conservative party chairman, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live this morning that requiring migrant care workers to pay the NHS surcharge was \u201cimmoral\u201d. He said: It\u2019s appalling, it\u2019s immoral. We depend in our care homes on people who come from other countries. I think this is monstrous that people who come from overseas to help and risk their lives in really difficult circumstances aren\u2019t treated properly. There\u2019s a basic sense of fair play in this country which I hope Mr Johnson will recognise. It would be madness and wickedness not to recognise the contribution which these people are making. It would be awful if we were to make people pay more when they are making such a big contribution to the well-being of older people in society. According to Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen, the Independent Office for Police Conduct will announce shortly that it will not be launching a criminal investigation into Boris Johnson and his relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor. As Matthew Weaver and Vikram Dodd report in their overnight preview story, Johnson was formally referred to the watchdog in September because he was the head of the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime at a time when Arcuri received public money and access to trade trips led by Johnson when he was mayor. Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including \u00a311,500 by the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, London &amp; Partners. UPDATE: In fact the Mirror seems to have broken the story first. The number of people with coronavirus in England has remained stable since the end of April, according to new data, with nearly 140,000 people infected in the last two weeks. As Frances Perraudin reports, the second snapshot of Covid-19 rates in the community, taken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), found that 137,000 people \u2013 0.25% of the population \u2013 had coronavirus at any given time during the two weeks from 4-17 May. The full story is here. Preparing for the impact of a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm local emergency response teams exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic, a leaked Whitehall report has warned. My colleagues Patrick Butler and Dan Peters have the full story here. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has posted this on Twitter ahead of the publication this afternoon of the Scottish government\u2019s roadmap for easing the coronavirus lockdown. She says she will be presenting a four-phase plan. By contrast, the UK government\u2019s plan (pdf) (which in most respects is just the English plan) is based on a three-step approach, with measures being relaxed on 13 May, from 1 June and from 4 July. Confusingly, the plan also talks of three phases, which are different. The three steps are all within phase two; phase three is essentially the vaccine, and phase one is the lockdown. The Welsh government\u2019s plan (pdf) also describes how the lockdown could be relaxed in three stages. It describes red, amber and green easing measures, but without dates for when these will happen. By contrast, he Northern Ireland executive has a five-step routemap (pdf) out of lockdown - again, with no dates attached. Here\u2019s the queue for a drive-through McDonald\u2019s that opened in Sutton yesterday. My colleague Joanna Partridge has more on the excitement generated by the return of McDonald\u2019s here. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, told the Today programme this morning that he was worried about complacency leading to a second wave of infection. He said: We know that test, trace, isolate works best when numbers are low and we\u2019ve got a small window now to be testing everyone that has got symptoms, to be tracing everyone they have been in contact with over the last few days and then to make sure they are tested, isolated and supported. Because my fear is that this good news could lead to complacency, which could lead to a second wave that would overwhelm the NHS and be really bad for people\u2019s lives, but also their livelihoods. He also said he did not want to see a \u201ca car-led recovery\u201d in London. Expanding on what he said in his letter to Matt Hancock (see 7.24am), the NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson told the Today programme that the government\u2019s new contact tracing system, which is due to be up and running a week on Monday (1 June) had to involve local government. He explained: I think it is being done very late in the day and we really do need to get on with this. I\u2019m not saying it is impossible to do it, but I think there is concern among those at local level because we\u2019ve seen - not occasionally, we\u2019ve seen often - where national stuff is done with the best of intentions, but unless the local context is understood it doesn\u2019t really work as well as it should. And I think it is only recently, to be brutally honest, that the government\u2019s rhetoric changed to recognise that to get this test, track and trace thing in place you not only need a national system, you not only need the app, but you also need to put at the centre of local plans local officials who understand about contact tracing - they do it all the time. But you need to coordinate that. AstraZeneca has said today that it now has secured the the capacity to manufacture 1bn doses of the potential coronavirus vaccine being developed at Oxford University. In a news release it said that data from a trial of the vaccine involving more than 1,000 volunteers is expected shortly. If the results are positive, there will be further late-stage trials in a number of countries. \u201cAstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk,\u201d the news release says. The Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye also told the Today programme that he supported the idea of \u201cair bridges\u201d - a plan floated by the transport secretary Grant Shapps earlier this week that would allow exemptions for travellers from certain countries when quarantine for new arrivals to the UK gets introduced. Holland-Kaye said: If they think the quarantine is the right thing to do I think we have to go with that but it has to be time-limited and we have to plan for what comes next. The idea of air bridges ... is a very sensible way of doing that. There is no perfect way to make sure only healthy people fly at this stage, so we have to take a risk-based approach. As the level of transmission comes down in this country and in other countries, we need to find a way that the vast, vast, vast majority of people who don\u2019t have a disease can still fly. Heathrow airport has now started trialling thermal screening for some arrivals at the airport. The cameras identify people with a high temperature. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, told the Today programme this morning that he hoped this system \u201ccould be part of a future common international standard to get people flying again\u201d. He explained: This mismatch of measures [across different countries] really confuses the travelling public. That\u2019s exactly why you need a common international standard. We have followed Public Health England\u2019s advice. Now we have started working with them to introduce this thermal screening. It\u2019s not yet government policy. Many of our passengers are travelling all over the world, very often connecting, and we need to adopt a common international standard, not just a UK standard. EasyJet will resume a small number of mainly domestic flights from 22 European airports from 15 June. As PA Media reports, EasyJet will serve a number of UK airports including Gatwick, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Belfast. The airline said it was \u201cintroducing new measures to help ensure safety and wellbeing, including enhanced aircraft cleaning and disinfection and requirement for passengers and crew to wear masks\u201d. Britain\u2019s economy continued to suffer an unprecedented contraction this month, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are shrinking extremely rapidly as the lockdown continues, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit. Graeme has more on his business live blog. And the Office for National Statistics has also published the results of a survey looking at the social impact of coronavirus. It shows that, at least until the end of last week, people were continuing to observe the stay-at-home rules - although there was a fall in the number of people self-isolating. The ONS figures for the infection rate in the community have not yet been published, although they are due out today. The Office for National Statistics has published the results of a new survey looking at the impact of coronavirus on the UK economy. Here are some of the main points. Around 78% of people working in accommodation and food services were furloughed between 20 April and 3 May, the survey suggests. This is the highest proportion for any section of the economy. Some 20% of businesses temporarily closed or paused trading during this period, the survey suggests. Some 6% of businesses said they had resumed trading in the last two weeks. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here\u2019s the agenda showing what\u2019s coming up. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics is publishing a series of reports covering coronavirus infection rates, the economic impact and the social impact. 10am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is questioned by the London assembly. 11am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 11am: The National Police Chiefs Council holds a briefing on crime during the lockdown. 12pm: The Independent Office for Police Conduct announces whether or not it is launching a criminal inquiry into Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with Jennifer Arcuri when he was mayor of London. 12.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, makes a statement to the Scottish parliament about the Scottish government\u2019s routemap for relaxing the lockdown being released today. 12.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.40pm: Dr Gregor Smith, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, and Prof Sheila Rowan, Scotland\u2019s chief scientific adviser, give evidence to the Commons Scottish affairs committee. 5pm: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is expected to take the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. The Welsh government has been reported to the Equality and Human Rights Commission over its handling of coronavirus testing in care homes. The country\u2019s older people\u2019s commissioner, Helena Herklots, told BBC Wales she believed the human rights and right to life of care home residents had been breached due to delays in expanding testing in the sector. Since lockdown began, 27% of the coronavirus deaths in Wales have been care home residents, according to the Office for National Statistics. This figure does not include those care home residents who died after being transferred to hospital. Quoted by the BBC, Herklots said: I have serious concerns that older people\u2019s human rights have been breached; the fundamental right to life. The fact that testing wasn\u2019t in place as quickly as it needed to be for every resident and every member of staff. I\u2019m extremely disappointed and saddened that the Welsh government hasn\u2019t moved quickly on this. That is why I believe the Equality and Human Rights Commission needs to investigate how older people have been treated throughout this pandemic. Wales\u2019s health minister, Vaughan Gething, defended his government\u2019s actions by saying that the advice and evidence was that there \u201cwasn\u2019t a value\u201d in testing people who were not symptomatic. \u201cWe changed the approach that we took on testing people who were leaving hospital on April 22 onwards,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The Welsh government has now expanded its testing programme so that every care home in Wales will have access to testing and be able to order online testing kits for residents and staff. Previously only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community. Staying in Scotland for a moment, the deputy first minister John Swinney has said the country faces \u201ca challenging situation\u201d in care homes due to testing capacity. Appearing on the Today programme, Swinney was asked if all care workers in infected homes in Scotland were now being tested, he replied: \u201cThey are eligible for testing now, yes.\u201d Pressed further, he said: \u201cWell, they should be able to get the test because they are eligible to get it and there is plenty of testing capacity available.\u201d The Scottish government has recruited 600 people to undertake contact tracing and was aiming to get 2,000 in place in total. On the 2,000, he said: \u201cWe won\u2019t need them on day one when we start this process, but at the end of this month when we want to be in a position to deliver a contact-tracing strategy, that will be able to be delivered in Scotland.\u201d Heriot-Watt university is to remove a controversial stone sculpture commissioned by Alex Salmond pledging Scotland would never abandon free tuition, after fee-paying students objected to its message. The sculpture quoted Salmond\u2019s statement as first minister that \u201cthe rocks will melt with the sun before I allow tuition fees to be imposed on Scotland\u2019s students\u201d, and was placed on the access road into Heriot-Watt\u2019s campus on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The university, along with the rest of its sector, faces significant financial problems due to the coronavirus pandemic with an expected collapse in the number of overseas and EU students attending UK universities. It is understood foreign students were unhappy with it since they pay thousands of pounds a year in fees. Although Scottish students pay no fees, those from the rest of the UK also pay up to \u00a39,250 a year to study in Scotland. Until Brexit, EU students were also exempt from paying tuition fees in Scotland, due to a quirk of EU law. Scottish ministers now have to decide whether to require fees from EU students after the UK\u2019s transition period finishes in January 2021. Heriot-Watt was ridiculed by critics for allowing the sculpture to be installed due to its bombastic tone and highly political message. It was erected during Salmond\u2019s final days in office after he lost the independence referendum in 2014. It was reported at the time that other universities refused to accept it. The university said: Following consultation with Heriot-Watt university student union, a decision has been taken to use the current location of the commemorative stone for an alternative public art work which will appeal to our international student community. The stone will be carefully looked after until an alternative location is found for it in future.0 Another issue weighing on the government this morning is that of the NHS surcharge \u2013 the fees some overseas health workers are charged to use the NHS. A senior Tory MP, William Wragg, has backed Labour\u2019s calls for the charge to be scrapped, saying that \u201cnow is the time for a generosity of spirit towards those who have done so much good\u201d. Wragg, who is chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said he was \u201csure\u201d that his Conservative colleagues would be supportive of his stance. Immigrants from outside the European Economic Area \u2013 often including NHS cleaners, porters and other healthcare staff \u2013 are required to pay an NHS surcharge of \u00a3400 a year, rising to \u00a3624 from October. On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, James Brokenshire was repeatedly asked whether the government would get rid of the charge. His answer, to paraphrase, was probably not: We continue to keep this under review but the principle of the NHS surcharge, the support that it provides financially to the NHS and indeed that sense of contribution to the NHS, I think is important. My esteemed colleague Sarah Boseley has written a very good explainer on the government\u2019s test, track and trace strategy, which is dominating the headlines this morning. But in brief, the strategy aims to: Test people to see if they currently have the virus. Track how and where the virus is spreading. Trace people who may be infected. Central to this plan has been a new NHS app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be ready to start being rolled out in mid-May. However, ministers now say it won\u2019t be ready until the next few weeks. The clock, as NHS figures are saying this morning, is very much ticking. The government\u2019s own scientific advisers say that a comprehensive and rapid test, track and trace system is crucial to any easing of the lockdown. Security minister James Brokenshire is touring the TV and radio studios for the government this morning. Responding to concerns from NHS leaders about delays to the test, track and trace system, Brokenshire insists he is \u201cconfident\u201d that it will be in place by 1 June (11 days from now). Brokenshire told Sky News that the app \u201cwill be introduced in the coming weeks in parallel\u201d with the system employing track and trace staff. He added: But obviously, the priority being to get these track and tracers trained, in place, that is what the prime minister is very confident about. We\u2019re confident the system will be there, able to track and trace around 10,000 people on 1 June. Pushed on whether the app is needed to competently track and trace, Brokenshire told Kay Burley: \u201cOf course Kay, we want to see the app rolled out, work continues at pace in relation to that, learning from the experience in the Isle of Wight, so that that can be adopted more broadly.\u201d Brokenshire added that the app provides \u201cextra support\u201d. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS providers \u2013 which represents hospital trusts \u2013 has said the health service risks being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d in a second peak of Covid-19 unless ministers quickly set out a clear strategy for its test, track and trace programme. He said NHS Trusts, GPs and workers on the 111 service have \u201cnot had clear information and instructions about what their role will be in this process\u201d. He added: We need clarity on exactly how this is going to work. Our colleagues at the Confederation are right: unless we can absolutely have clarity on that quickly, there clearly will be a risk to the NHS that we get overwhelmed in a second peak, which nobody wants. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK developments on the coronavirus pandemic. Leading the headlines today are NHS leaders warning that the government is running out of time to launch its test and trace system if a possible second wave of coronavirus is to be avoided. Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation - which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, because his members were \u201cconcerned\u201d over an apparent lack of a clear strategy. \u201cWe would therefore urge you to produce such a strategy with a clear implementation plan ahead of any further easing of the lockdown,\u201d Dickson said in his letter. Test, track and trace - TTT - means testing people for coronavirus, tracking the spread of the virus, then tracing the people with whom an infected person has come into contact. The government\u2019s own scientific advisers have said such a system is critical to any lifting of the lockdown. We will bring you all the day\u2019s developments from the Commons and beyond.

But right now Boris Johnson is working flat out to make it abundantly clear that his government has chosen to firmly come down on the side of complete cluelessness.</p> <p>On Wednesday at prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris had been clear. It was entirely right for people from overseas working in the NHS and social care sectors to pay a \u00a3624 visa surcharge to use the NHS themselves. After all, if they were going to come over here and try to save people\u2019s lives \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s included \u2013 then they ought to pay for the privilege. It was just common sense. People working on the front line were far more likely to get coronavirus, so they could well end up using NHS resources that should have been available to hardworking Brits who wouldn\u2019t dream of doing such a highly skilled job for so little money. Call it the Corona Cough-Up.</p> <p>Midway through Thursday, though \u2013 after a lot of pushback from all opposition parties and several of his own MPs \u2013 Boris had a change of heart. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">NHS staff and care workers would be exempt from the surcharge</a>. Though, needless to say, all other workers who helped keep the NHS up and running, such as delivery drivers and childminders, would still get fleeced. Because they were all still slackers and freeloaders.</p> <p>So you might have thought that Boris might want to use the daily Downing Street press conference as a platform to explain his unexpected fit of compassion and largesse. Or even to express his delight that the police had decided that doing financial favours for someone he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-jennifer-arcuri-in-diary\">doing IT with</a> was no big deal.</p> <p>Only, Boris doesn\u2019t do press briefings any more. Or anything much. Can\u2019t be arsed. Why should the prime minister explain anything to anyone during the worst health crisis in 100 years? It was a nice afternoon, he was about to go on a 10-day Whitsun break with Carrie, Dilyn the dog and some baby that had mysteriously appeared in Downing Street, and he could do without the hassle. And it had been a whole two months since he\u2019d taken 10 days off right at the beginning of the pandemic. In any case, he\u2019d already had coronavirus, so he was just fine.</p> <p>Inevitably, then, it was Matt Hancock who got lumbered with the press conference. Matt gets landed with all the shit jobs right now and he\u2019s resigned to the fact that he\u2019s been set up as the fall guy. Old habits die hard with the health secretary. His natural demeanour as the enthusiastic class nerd, whose exercise books are full of high-school massacre fantasies, is hardwired into his personality. He longs to stand up to the prime minister, but instinctively crumbles. He justifies it as furthering his career, but there\u2019s a tragic sadness to his ambition these days. As if he knows he ran out of road several weeks back, but can\u2019t help himself.</p> <p>Matt opened by talking about mental health awareness week. \u201cIt is OK to not be OK,\u201d he said. These were the only true and heartfelt words he said throughout the hour. Because he was talking to himself as much as anyone following the briefing on TV. Matt is not OK. He hasn\u2019t been OK for a while. He\u2019s become snappier, more short-tempered. He\u2019s aged visibly over the past few months. Lines have appeared on his shiny, prepubescent face. In time, we might see hints of acne. If anyone in the cabinet really cared about his mental health, they\u2019d put Matt on a furlough scheme for several months.</p> <p>After monotoning his way through a spiel about various tests that he knows no one would take seriously, as the government has failed on just about every promise it has so far made during the crisis, Matt came to the bit he had been dreading: the questions. Inevitably, first up was Johnson\u2019s U-turn on the visa surcharge. Here was his chance to stick up for himself, to say he had never believed in it and it had only ever been some vindictive scheme dreamed up by Boris and Priti Patel to keep Brexiters happy. But Matt didn\u2019t have the self-worth to be anything other than a lapdog. Boris had misunderstood Keir Starmer at PMQs and had imagined he was talking about the surcharge in general and not just for NHS workers.</p> <p>Matt was now in so deep that the lies began to slip off the tongue with increasing ease. Yes, the government was all over social care, and no person would be asked to sell their home to pay for their care. Which will come as news to my mother, who had to sell hers to pay for her care. But the health secretary\u2019s worst moment came when he was asked about his \u201ctest, track and trace app\u201d that only a few weeks ago he was telling the country would be key to easing lockdown restrictions, but has now gone missing in action. It was due to be launched nationwide in mid-May, but now Matt can\u2019t even bring himself to mention it in polite conversation. Selective amnesia.</p> <p>What app? Oh, that app. Well, when he had said it was vital, what he had really meant was that it was utterly peripheral. In fact, in many ways it was far better that the test and track process begin without the app, as it was far better to have tracking from people who had scarcely been given any training in what they were doing. Everything was going to be fine \u2013 just not yet. After a question about restarting football from Robbie Savage \u2013 basically, just forget it \u2013 Matt slipped away. It had been an ordeal. But no worse than the one Boris probably has lined up for him tomorrow. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.</p>",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She warned that the lockdown could be reimposed if the virus returned, and urged people in Scotland to continue observing all existing restrictions until the first relaxation began next Thursday.</p> \n<p>Scotland is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">last of the four parts of the UK</a> to publish specific plans on easing the lockdown; the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">did so on 10 May,</a> with Wales and Northern Ireland already allowing outdoor sports, recycling centres and garden centres to restart.</p> \n<p>The latest Scottish data on deaths in hospitals, intensive care cases and hospital admissions confirmed the gradual decline in the severity of the outbreak.

Top stories Pro-democracy activists have warned that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomous status is about to come to an end, as China looks to push wide-reaching new national security laws through its own parliament.

Globally, the virus continues to spread across Latin America and South Asia, with Bangladesh reporting its worst daily figure for new infections thus far, as the nation begins the cleanup from the devastating Cyclone Amphan. Australia Plans for a federal integrity commission have been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the federal attorney general has said, after missing multiple deadlines to establish the body, three years since beginning work on the proposal. Christian Porter said draft legislation would be released \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d. The driver of a station wagon that crashed into a Sydney hijab shop on Thursday afternoon, injuring 14 people, has been released from police custody. Police say the 51-year-old was taken to Liverpool hospital and underwent mandatory testing before being taken to Bankstown police station. A coalition of peak bodies from business, industry, unions and the environmental movement has urged the federal government to make a transition to net zero emissions a key part of a post-Covid economic strategy. Australian researchers are claiming a world first in producing more efficient solar panels, with the use of a crystal material known as perovskite proving thinner and more flexible than the traditional silicon-based cells.

A recent survey of BBPA members found that 19,000 out of the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/thousands-uk-pubs-go-under-without-bailout-industry-warns-coronavirus-lockdown\">they may be unable to reopen</a>.<br><br>Graeme Smith, the managing director at AlixPartners, said: \u201cMany operators have got their tape measures out to assess the impact of social distancing restrictions on operations and capacity. Even with well-configured space, cover counts will be meaningfully reduced and may prompt further questions on whether it is sensible to reopen, or not, from a profit perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Two-thirds of the UK\u2019s 115,108 licensed venues are independents, with the rest belonging to groups. The monitor figures point to the special vulnerability of casual dining restaurants.

A recent survey of BBPA members found that 19,000 out of the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs believe they may be unable to reopen. Graeme Smith, the managing director at AlixPartners, said: \u201cMany operators have got their tape measures out to assess the impact of social distancing restrictions on operations and capacity. Even with well-configured space, cover counts will be meaningfully reduced and may prompt further questions on whether it is sensible to reopen, or not, from a profit perspective.\u201d Two-thirds of the UK\u2019s 115,108 licensed venues are independents, with the rest belonging to groups. The monitor figures point to the special vulnerability of casual dining restaurants. With many located in shopping centres and near office blocks, analysts think their trade may take longer to bounce back. A number of casual dining chains have already been forced into dramatic retrenchments after an investor-fuelled expansion boom ended in tears. Last year Jamie\u2019s Italian all but disappeared while the rescue deal being brokered for the Carluccio\u2019s Italian dining chain is expected to save just 30 of its 77 outlets. The report suggested that local pubs and restaurants which have also fallen out of favour \u2013 with community pub numbers declining 3.7% in the same period \u2013 could emerge as winners from the crisis as consumer points to the public\u2019s preference to return to local establishments before heading back to city and town centres.",

Here the latest developments at a glance: Latin America has reported more new coronavirus cases than either the United States or Europe for three days in a row, driven by high numbers in Brazil, Peru and Mexico, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University and World Health Organization data shows. The region reported at least 32,854 new cases on Wednesday, more than half of which were in Brazil. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said Thursday. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe\u2019s worst affected region. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion-real ($10.72 bn) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus, but asked governors for support by freezing public sector pay increases. Brazil has just passed another grim coronavirus milestone, with more than 20,000 deaths now officially confirmed. A scientific adviser to the British government, Ian Boyd, has said that, had ministers acted \u201ca week or two weeks earlier\u201d in the virus pandemic, it would have made \u201cquite a big difference\u201d to the death rate. Chechnya\u2019s leader Ramzan Kadyrov is possibly ill with Covid-19 and in a Moscow hospital suffering from suspected coronavirus, Russian news agencies reported, adding the ally of Vladimir Putin was \u201cunder medical supervision\u201d and in a \u201cstable\u201d condition. Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6 percent in April compared to the previous year, with its economy predicted to shrink by up to six percent in 2020. Russia imposed a \u201cnon-working\u201d period across the country at the end of April, and Russia\u2019s Audit Chamber predicts that the number of unemployed will grow from 2.5 million to eight million this year. Half of Facebook\u2019s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade, founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed, saying it was \u201cquite possible\u201d that over the next five to 10 years about 50% of staff at the company could be working from hom More than 1,200 California pastors say they will resume in-person services this month in defiance of Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of coronavirus. California has more than 85,700 coronavirus cases and more than 3,400 deaths. Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island that now has a 40% unemployment rate. That\u2019s all from me, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Alison Rourke. Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Brazil has just passed another grim coronavirus milestone, with more than 20,000 deaths from Covid-19 now officially confirmed here. On Thursday evening Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced a daily record of 1,188 deaths confirmed in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of officially recorded deaths to 20,047. Brazil also confirmed another 18,508 infections, taking the total number to 310,087. That is the third highest number in the world, after the US and Russia. Despite Brazil\u2019s rising death toll the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to downplay the dangers of the coronavirus, which he has repeatedly dismissed as \u201ca bit of a cold\u201d and \u201ca little flu\u201d. On Thursday, just hours before the new death toll was announced, Bolsonaro claimed the pandemic\u2019s threat had been exaggerated with \u201ca great deal of propaganda\u201d. \u201cThis has brought dread to the heart of the Brazilian family,\u201d Bolsonaro complained. Sub-notification and low rates of testing mean the real number of infections and deaths are likely to be substantially higher. Some experts fear Brazil\u2019s death toll could rise to at least 100,000 in the coming months. A scientific adviser to the British government has said that he would have liked ministers to have acted \u201ca week or two weeks earlier\u201d in the virus pandemic, the BBC reports. Ian Boyd, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers on Covid-19, said \u201cit would have made \u201cquite a big difference\u201d to the death rate. Ministers have always insisted they have been guided by the scientific advice during the pandemic. The official death toll in the UK currently stands at 36,042. Boyd started attending Sage meetings a month ago. \u201cActing very early was really important and I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s really the number one issue - could we have acted earlier? Were the signs there earlier on?\u201d Boyd suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. Here a picture of US president Donald Trump holding up but not wearing a face shield during a tour of Ford Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan on Thursday. The wearing of masks is mandatory at the plant. The plant is manufacturing ventilators, masks and other medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. Austria\u2019s hotels will reopen as planned on 29 May, chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced on Thursday. Infection rates were low enough to allow a reopening of the tourism sector, he said, according to Der Standard newspaper. Up to 65,000 tourism industry workers will be tested regularly for coronavirus until early July, under a programme that is financed by the government. Austria has so far recorded 633 Covid-19 deaths. Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island already beset with economic woes. Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez announced Thursday that most businesses will reopen on Tuesday, but a 7pm to 5am curfew will remain in place until June 15, the Associated Press reports. All people will be required to wear a mask when outside or inside a business, regardless of what they are doing. Restaurants will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity. Hair salons and barber shops will welcome clients by appointment only. People doing exercise, such as surfing, jogging, swimming or kayaking, will be allowed at the beach from 5am to 7pm. Stores and malls will be allowed to reopen but under limited capacity, and people will be prohibited from trying on clothes, among other restrictions. Many Puerto Ricans, including business owners, cheered the highly anticipated announcement. Health experts warned that the government has not tested enough people or conducted enough contact tracing and is not prepared for a possible spike in new infections. Puerto Ricos Health Department has reported more than 2,900 confirmed Covid-19 cases and at least 126 deaths, and dozens of additional infections still emerge every day. Officials do not regularly update statistics, including how many people have been tested or how many have recovered. Until recently, the island had a lower per-capita testing rate than any US state. Puerto Rico\u2019s lockdown caused the unemployment rate to spike to an estimated 40% on an island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40%, higher than any U.S. state. US president Donald Trump is eager to get back on the campaign trail and said on Thursday he may have to stage rallies at outdoor sites until the coronavirus pandemic settles down enough for traditional events, Reuters reports. \u201cWe got to get back to the rallies,\u201d Trump told reporters during a tour of a Ford auto plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be sooner rather than later.\u201d With little more than five months left until the election, Trump is behind Democratic rival Joe Biden in national polls and in some battleground states, such as Michigan, which he won in 2016. A senior campaign official said the campaign was aiming for as early as mid-June to hold a rally, with preferred locations in battleground states like Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. A Trump adviser said a mid-June timetable might be too optimistic, that it might have to wait until after the July 4 holiday. The president has been told by his advisers that he is facing a race in 2020 tougher than his improbable victory in 2016, the adviser said. Trump said rallies could be held first in his adopted home state of Florida or Georgia, \u201cwhoever opens first.\u201d \u201cWe might do some outdoor big ones and we also may just wait until some of the stadiums can open up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demand has been incredible to get going with the rallies.\u201d Half of Facebook\u2019s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade, founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed, according to the Press Association. The social network\u2019s chief set out his vision to employees on Thursday, prompted by the coronavirus crisis which has forced companies across the globe to embrace remote working in recent months. Zuckerberg said it is \u201cquite possible\u201d that over the next five to 10 years about 50% of staff at the company could be working from home, though he warned that those interested could see salaries cut if they decide to be located away from big cities where living expenses tend to be higher. The tech giant also plans to \u201caggressively open up\u201d remote hiring, though the process will be staggered, starting with experienced engineers living in the US and Canada. \u201cThis is fundamentally about changing our culture, in the way that we all are going to work long-term, so I think I\u2019m optimistic about this direction, but I want to make sure that we move forward in a measured way,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAt the same time, I also want to emphasise that I just think Covid is going to be with us for a while to come.\u201d The 36-year-old hopes that the move will help retain workers that want to live in areas further away from offices, while attracting new talent from further afield. More than 95% of Facebook\u2019s staff are currently working from home due to Covid-19. The success of permanent remote working would \u201crely on the honour code\u201d, Zuckerberg said, adding it was vital for tax and accounting purposes for people to declare their locations. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said Thursday. The Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), the largest social security and welfare institute in Italy, said in a new study that the official death figures were not \u201creliable\u201d, according to AFP. Its study showed that 156,42 total deaths were recorded in Italy in March and April, which is 46,909 higher than the average number of fatalities in those months recorded between 2015 and 2019. But only 27,938 deaths linked to coronavirus were reported during that period by the Civil Protection Agency, whose toll forms the basis of national statistics, the INPS said. That meant there were 18,971 excess deaths during this period, with the vast majority of 18,412 recorded in the coronavirus-ravaged north of the country. \u201cGiven the fact that the number of deaths is quite stable in these times, we can - with necessary caution - attribute a large portion of these deaths during these past two months to the epidemic,\u201d the INPS said. It added that the increase in deaths was likely not only due to the disease, but from people suffering from other illnesses unable to get healthcare due to hospitals being overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe\u2019s worst affected region. A two-day-old baby has died because of a coronavirus-related condition in South Africa, the government said Thursday. The baby was born preterm with lung difficulties and had to be put on a ventilator, according to a statement from the health ministry, CNN reports. \u201cThe mother had tested positive for Covid-19, and the child subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 as well. It is important to appreciate the complexities of the underlying condition of prematurity,\u201d the statement read. The baby is among the 27 coronavirus deaths announced Wednesday, bringing the total number to 339, according to the ministry. With more than 18,000 cases, South Africa has the highest number of coronavirus patients on the continent. Our US live blog is reporting that once again Donald Trump has carried out an official visit without wearing a face mask. The US president, who was touring a Ford factory in Michigan that has been adapted to making medical equipment, said that he did not require a mask all the time as he is tested frequently for coronavirus. Read more on our US blog. Data on coronavirus infections that was a key driver in Governor Brian Kemps\u2019 aggressive push to reopen the US state of Georgia was flawed and may have distorted perceptions of progress against the virus, the Associated Press reports. Georgia Department of Public Health spokeswoman Nancy Nydam said in a statement on Thursday that the department included antibody tests when calculating the total number of tests conducted since early April. She said about 57,000 of the 407,000 total tests reported to the state had been antibody tests, about 14%. Conflating tests looking for antibodies and tests aimed at detecting the virus can create confusion about the current impact of the virus, said Richard Rothenberg, an infectious disease expert at Georgia State University, adding that the mistake would have made a substantial impact on the perception of the outbreak. Kemp relied on the state seeing a downward trajectory of the percentage of positive tests when making his decision to be one of the first states in the nation to allow business to reopen. Salons, restaurants, gyms and other businesses in Georgia were given the green light to reopen in April. Kemp\u2019s spokeswoman Candice Broce declined to comment. Speaking of churches: More than 1,200 California pastors say they will resume in-person services this month in defiance of Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of coronavirus. California has more than 85,700 coronavirus cases and more than 3,400 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The number of people infected is probably higher because of a lack of testing. More here: Churches in the Iranian capital Tehran were given a deep-clean on Thursday, according to Living in Tehran. So far, 7,249 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Iran, and new infections have risen sharply since the country relaxed its restrictions on movement on 11 April. Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6 percent in April compared to the previous year, dampened by the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, according to the state statistics agency Rosstat. Russia imposed a \u201cnon-working\u201d period across the country at the end of April which \u201cserved as the decisive factor in lowering industrial output,\u201d Rosstat said in a statement, AFP reports. Industries were delivered a double blow as president Vladimir Putin ordered companies to stop work activities but continue paying salaries. At the same time, \u201cconsumer demand fell for a range of goods and services,\u201d the agency said. Russia\u2019s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2 percent year on year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2 percent, the agency said, noting that for many of those companies ceasing activity was not possible. The automotive sector was the worst-hit, plummeting by 79.2 percent, while the pharmaceutical industries showed growth of 13.5 percent year on year. Each month in lockdown could cost Russia between 20 and 30 percent of monthly growth, according to calculations by the ING. The Central Bank last month predicted that Russian economy would shrink by up to six percent in 2020. Russia\u2019s Audit Chamber predicts that the number of unemployed will grow from 2.5 million to eight million this year. Chechnya\u2019s leader Ramzan Kadyrov was on Thursday in hospital in Moscow suffering from suspected coronavirus, Russian news agencies reported, according to AFP. \u201cRamzan Kadyrov was taken by plane to Moscow with a suspected case of coronavirus. Now (he) is under medical supervision,\u201d state news agency TASS reported, citing a medical source who also said Kadyrov was in a \u201cstable\u201d condition. News agency RIA Novosti also quoted a medical source as saying Kadyrov, 43, was in hospital in Moscow, while Interfax quoted a Moscow medical source saying he was being treated and \u201csuspected of having coronavirus\u201d. If confirmed, Kadyrov would be the latest senior official to contract the virus after prime minister Mikhail Mishustin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and several ministers. There was no immediate comment from officials in Chechnya or Moscow. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion-real ($10.72 billion) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus, but asked governors for support freezing public sector pay increases. The bill to distribute federal money to states and municipalities was approved by Congress earlier this month. However, Bolsonaro has not signed off on it due to pressure from economy minister Paulo Guedes, who is pushing for more fiscal austerity, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro is under growing pressure for his handling of the outbreak, which looks set to cripple the Brazilian economy and threatens his re-election hopes. In the coming days, Brazil is likely to become the world\u2019s second-worst affected country, behind only to the United States. Nearly 19,000 have died so far from the virus in Brazil, with 291,579 confirmed cases. The true number of infections and deaths is likely to be higher as Brazil has not been carrying out widespread testing. Bolsonaro\u2019s relationship with governors and mayors has grown increasingly bitter. The president is angry over shutdowns they have implemented to stop the virus\u2019 spread and argues that keeping the economy running is more important. In return for signing off on the aid package, Bolsonaro asked governors for their backing in specific measures freezing public sector pay increases for two years. Guatemala\u2019s president has criticised the US for continuing to send deportees infected with coronavirus to the country which is struggling to manage the crisis, reports Associated Press. On Thursday, Alejandro Giammattei said: \u201cGuatemala is an ally of the United States, but the United States is not Guatemala\u2019s ally. They don\u2019t treat us like an ally.\u201d Giammattei is the first of central America\u2019s leaders to speak out against the US policy that has sent thousands of deportees back to their countries since the pandemic began. Guatemala has confirmed 119 deportees arrived with Covid-19 from the United States. The country has suspended the deportation flights on several occasions after infected passengers were detected, but resumed them after assurances from US authorities. The last flight with deportees who tested positive in Guatemala arrived on 13 May from Louisiana. Officials have said 16 of them have tested positive. A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson confirmed this week that all 65 of those aboard that flight had been tested prior to departure. Fifteen more Guatemalans scheduled to be on that flight tested positive and were returned to detention facilities where they were isolated from other detainees. Strict coronavirus lockdowns in Guatemala and El Salvador have battered local economies to the extent that hundreds of families are flying white flags outside their homes or waving them in the street: not in surrender, but to seek food and assistance, Reuters reports. After 50 days of lockdown, many people in El Salvador have lost their livelihoods. In March, El Salvador\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, issued a $300 voucher to 1.5 million poor families, about three-quarters of the population. Food protests have broken out in countries including Venezuela and Chile. Latin America has reported more new coronavirus cases than either the United States or Europe for three days in a row, driven by high numbers in Brazil, Peru and Mexico, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University and World Health Organization data shows. The region reported at least 32,854 new cases on Wednesday, more than half of which were in Brazil. The United States reported 22,534 new cases that day, according to Johns Hopkins University, while Europe, including Russia, reported about 17,900, according to the WHO. Both agencies rely on national governments for their data. Here is a nice little clip from ABC\u2019s James Longman on a walk through the deserted streets of Santorini, one of Greece\u2019s most popular tourist resorts. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has said that the country\u2019s tourism season will begin on 15 June. \u201cLet us make this summer the epilogue of the [Covid-19] crisis,\u201d he said in a televised address on Wednesday. The growth rate of new confirmed coronavirus cases in France slowed slightly on Thursday, with health authorities reporting an additional 318 known infections, an increase of 0.2% over 24 hours. The rate of increases in reported deaths also slowed a little, with 83 Covid-19 fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 28,215, Reuters reports. The number of new cases and deaths increased by 0.3% and 0.4% respectively on Wednesday. Thursday is a public holiday in France, and nursing homes in particular can be slower to report fatalities and cases on weekends and national holidays. In the last two weeks of the lockdown, the daily rise in the number of confirmed cases was on average 0.8%. Genevieve Chene, head of health authority Sante Publique France (SPF), said this week there were no signs the pandemic was picking up, despite some new infection clusters, after France began emerging cautiously from lockdown on 11 May. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Damien Gayle. If you want to share updates or tips, please feel free to email me or message me on Twitter. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The World Health Organization warned on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide in 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Spain\u2019s daily death toll from the novel coronavirus was 48, its health ministry said on Thursday, marking the first time it has dipped below 50 since 16 March. However, its figures did not include those for Catalonia, where officials were still double checking their report. Apple has launched a Covid-19 exposure notification feature in the latest update of its iPhone operating system. The software will offer health authorities a way to build apps that can alert people about corona-positive users they have come into contact with, while preserving their anonymity. The total number of initial unemployment benefit claims filed in the US since mid-March is now over 38 million, or over a fifth of the US workforce. It is the ninth week in a row in which millions of US citizens signed on for welfare benefits, having lost their jobs in the lockdown. East Africa is facing \u201ctriple menace\u201d of floods, locusts and Covid-19, the Red Cross warned. The region was in the grip of mutually exacerbating disasters, as ongoing heavy rain hampers attempts to deal with swarms of locusts in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the agency. Bangladesh has reported its highest daily increase in coronavirus cases, as it begins cleaning up after the fiercest cyclone to hit the country since 1999 - 1,773 more people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 28,511. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in most parts of the war-torn country, as the capital Kabul recorded its second worst day of the crisis. The official coronavirus death toll in Russia passed 3,000 on Thursday, as a US transport plane made its way to deliver ventilators to help treat Russian patients severely ill with Covid-19. Eating wild animals is now officially banned in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first coronavirus cases were recorded. According to the Wuhan municipal government it is now prohibited to eat, hunt or breed wild animals. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I will be back tomorrow. Meanwhile, in the United States, Donald Trump, the president, has announced that he has tested positively negative for the coronavirus. Had the US begun social distancing just one week earlier, the country would have prevented 36,000 deaths through early May, according to researchers at Columbia University, writes Kenya Evelyn in Washington for the Guardian US. Had action been taken two weeks earlier, by 1 March, 54,000 fewer Americans would have died of the virus, the researchers determined. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big difference,\u201d Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia and the leader of the research team, told the New York Times. \u201cThat small moment in time, catching it in that growth phase, is incredibly critical in reducing the number of deaths.\u201d Using infectious-disease modeling to examine the spread of the virus from mid-March, the epidemiologists were able to track how reduced contact between people slowed the virus\u2019s transmission. The country remained social and open for business for much of March, including for sports , political rallies and Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Only 500 coronavirus infections had been reported nationwide at the time. By April, large clusters were evident, including in major cities like New York. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said antibody tests suggest that 17% of people in London and 5% in the rest of the country may have had coronavirus. If true, the figure constitutes a remarkable spread of the virus despite the government-imposed lockdown to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. It would be more than twice the spread of the virus in Stockholm, Sweden, where no official lockdown was imposed, yet just 7% of people have been found to be carrying antibodies. In the UK government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, Hancock also said the government has signed a deal with pharmaceutical companies Roche and Abbott that will lead to 10m antibody tests being available in the UK. The UK reported 338 more deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday, taking its total official death toll to 36,042 - about 3,500 more than Italy the next worst off country in Europe by death toll. The latest update also reported that 2,615 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the UK\u2019s total number of confirmed cases to 250,908. Air travellers in Europe will have to wear face masks throughout all stages of their journey, they could be assessed in interview booths if they show signs of Covid-19, and will need to say goodbye to loved ones outside the airport, according to guidelines issued by the EU\u2019s air safety body, writes Rob Davies for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. Instructions issued to airports and airlines also include: restrictions on hand luggage, reserving an on-board toilet for cabin crew and no onboard duty free or food trolleys. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published 28-pages of guidelines that will radically alter the experience of flying, including physical distancing measures that Heathrow\u2019s chief executive has previously said would be impossible to implement. The UK has had no role in shaping EASA policy since the official Brexit date of 31 January but remains a member until the end of the year. Airlines and airports are likely to adopt many of the guidelines, which cover every stage of the air travel process. (Click below for many, many more details.) Twenty-nine cases of Covid-19 have been detected in the past three days in the Gaza strip, a senior Palestinian official said on Thursday. Yousef Abu al-Reesh, director general of the ministry of health in the Hamas-run territory, said the number of cases in Gaza had now reached 49 since the first was detected on 5 March, China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua reports. All the new cases had been detected in Palestinians who had returned to Gaza through the Rafah crossing point with Egypt and the Erez crossing with Israel. They have been placed in quarantine in 16 medical centres across Gaza, Reesh said, adding that medical officials would monitor those they had been in contact with, according to the Daily Sabah. Beijing will retaliate if the US congress passes legislation seeking sanctions against China over the coronavirus pandemic, the spokesman for the country\u2019s parliament said Thursday, AFP reports. Republican senators proposed legislation last week that would empower Trump to impose sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the outbreak. At a news conference on the eve of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, the parliamentary spokesman, Zhang Yesui, said: We firmly oppose these bills, and will make a firm response and take countermeasures based on the deliberation of these bills ... It is neither responsible nor moral to cover up one\u2019s own problems by blaming others. We will never accept any unwarranted lawsuits and demands for compensation. In Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, where many have not earned money for months because of a strict coronavirus lockdown, three women were trampled to death in a stampede for an $8 Ramadan handout. Some 1,000 people queued outside a businessman\u2019s warehouse for his annual handout during the Muslim fasting month, a local member of parliament, Mujibur Rahman, told AFP. There was a rush for the 1,500-rupee gift - about the same amount as a labourer\u2019s daily wage - when the gates opened, he said. \u201cSome people tried to break the queue and enter,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cThat is when the women at the top of the queue fell and were trampled to death.\u201d Nine others were seriously hurt and taken to hospital, he said, adding that there was a larger-than-usual crowd during this year\u2019s event, which has been taking place for decades. \u201cPeople have not earned any money for two months because of the virus lockdown (imposed on 20 March),\u201d Rahman said. \u201cPeople are desperate. When they heard about today\u2019s donation, over a thousand turned up.\u201d The businessman, who has not been named by authorities, and five of his assistants were arrested for violating the lockdown, Colombo\u2019s police chief, Deshabandu Tennakoon, told reporters. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 156 on Wednesday, against 161 on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 32,486, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections increased by 642, compared to 665 on Wednesday, according to the civil protection authority. There are 60,960 people who are currently infected with the virus, down by over 2,000 within the last 24 hours, and of that number 640 are in intensive care. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told parliament on Thursday: \u201cIf the worst is behind us, we owe it to citizens, who have changed their lifestyles.\u201d He also encouraged the public to take their holidays in Italy. Italy is expected to allow travel between regions from early June, but possibly only to regions that are deemed to be low risk. Meanwhile, all airports are expected to reopen from 3 June. The country has 228,006 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, including the deaths and 134,560 survivors. Regarding the serological study that found just 1% of Danes are carrying antibodies for the coronavirus, a reader has written in to urge caution on the results. The percentage of \u201cimmune\u201d persons is very likely wrong as the sample size is minuscule (1,000) and the number of positives just 12. The test itself is not 100% reliable so the error bounds on your 1% number must be quite huge. Those bounds should also be reported. Indeed, not included in my earlier blog post was the commentary from SSI, the Danish health agency, which pointed out that the tests were preliminary, and that they had only been able to carry out tests at five locations, meaning they had been limited to people living in those, or neighbouring, districts. Furthermore, Steen Ethelberg, an SSI official, said in a statement: Whether the figures can be applied to the entire Danish population can also be affected by whether groups with different patterns of infection choose or not choose to accept the offer to be tested. Egypt\u2019s minister of higher information has said the true number of coronavirus infections in the country could be over 71,000, compared to the 14,229 cases officially reported so far, writes Ruth Michaelson. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar outlined the potential number of cases in a presentation witnessed by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, adding that the number of confirmed cases in Egypt will break 20,000 cases next week. \u201cAssuming [the number of infections] is five times the figure we are counting every day \u2026 this means we do not have [around] 14,000 cases today, we have 71,145 or more,\u201d he said. He added that this means Egypt could reach 100,000 cases by the end of this month. \u201cThis is a hypothetical model that we say could be a reality, and [the figure] can be even higher,\u201d he said. Egypt has recently witnessed an uptick in cases, with each day this week breaking a new record for the number of confirmed positive coronavirus test results. But the question of just how many cases the country is dealing with has proved controversial since the beginning of the outbreak in mid-February. The Egyptian authorities pushed back hard against a study from scientists at the University of Toronto who modelled the outbreak at the beginning of March. At a time when Egypt officially had three cases, they said, the true number was more likely higher, anywhere between 6,270\u201345,070, with a median of 19,310. Egyptian health ministry officials published a response in the Lancet which estimated a far smaller range as of the end of March, between 710\u20135,241 cases. When the Guardian cited the University of Toronto modelling in a story, the Ministry of Health called the reporting \u201ca disgrace to health,\u201d and the State Information Service withdrew our permission to operate in Egypt. The Egyptian government is currently engaged in a protracted battle with doctors over how to manage the rapidly increasing case numbers, after a health ministry official told a government health committee at the beginning of this month that the country\u2019s quarantine hospitals are full. Museums, zoos, theatres, cinemas and similar cultural institutions began reopening in Denmark on Thursday, after the country decided to accelerate its exit from its coronavirus lockdown. The original plan was to closed until 8 June, but after a deal was struck in the country\u2019s parliament late Wednesday they were instead allowed to open immediately. \u201cIt was pure cheer. Finally, we can get started,\u201d Peter Kjargaard, director of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, told broadcaster DR. Kjargaard added that he was excited to show off the museum\u2019s new dinosaur exhibit, even if it wouldn\u2019t be ready for another month. Under the deal agreed in parliament, the Danish border remains temporarily closed, but starting next week the list of exceptions allowing travel to Denmark will be expanded to include permanent residents of all the Nordic countries and Germany wanting to visit relatives, loved ones, or homes they own in Denmark. High school students will also begin returning to classrooms shortly. Travellers will not need coronavirus tests or periods in quarantine to enter Serbia from 22 May, the transport minister said on Thursday after a ceremony to reopen flights after a two-month suspension. As Air Serbia became one of the the first European airlines to resume commercial passenger flights, Serbia\u2019s minister for construction, transport and infrastructure, Zorana Mihajlovic, was quoted as saying by Russia\u2019s Tass news agency: Today there will be a government session where the decision will be taken at the suggestion of the anti-coronavirus crisis centre, that starting tomorrow, the citizens of Serbia and other nations crossing into the country will not have to be tested or isolated. We rely only on personal responsibility. Air Serbia was planning 12 international flights on Thursday, to destinations including Zurich, Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi. But the first passengers will have to comply with strict hygiene measures, including compulsory gloves and face masks, and arrive three hours prior to their flights for enhanced screening measures. As of Thursday, Serbia had recorded 10,919 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 237 deaths, including two in the past 24 hours. Bangladesh has reported its highest daily increase in coronavirus cases, as it begins cleaning up after the fiercest cyclone to hit the country since 1999. The institute of epidemiology, disease control and research said 1,773 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 28,511. Of those, 5,602 have so far recovered, while 408 have died - 22 of them in the past 24 hours. The latest figures came as Bangladesh and India began a clean-up operation after Cyclone Amphan, which killed 88 people across both countries as it flattened houses, uprooted trees, blew off roofs and toppled electricity pylons, and cause a storm surge that inundated coastal villages, AFP reports. The UN office in Bangladesh estimates 10 million people were affected, and some 500,000 people may have lost their homes. The death toll was far lower than the many thousands killed in previous cyclones, thanks in part to improved weather forecasting and better response plans. But it has raised fears that overcrowding in storm shelters may exacerbate the spread of coronavirus. Spain\u2019s daily death toll from the novel coronavirus was 48, its health ministry said on Thursday, marking the first time it has dipped below 50 since 16 March, Reuters reports. The cumulative death toll was 27,940, while the number of confirmed cases rose by 482 to 233,037, the ministry said. Nearly 70 Yemenis have died from coronavirus in the only medical centre in the southern port of Aden in the 18 days to 17 May, suggesting an epidemic is under way that could engulf the country, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic correspondent. Yemen is ravaged by civil war, and protected only by minimal health services. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, the agency that runs the Aden centre, said 173 patients had been admitted, suggesting around four in 10 had died. The NGO, along with many humanitarian workers, is concerned that the absence of reliable information on the spread of the virus across Yemen could be masking a disastrous situation. Caroline Seguin, MSF\u2019s operations manager for Yemen, said: What we are seeing in our treatment centre is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in the city. People are coming to us too late to save, and we know that many more people are not coming at all: they are just dying at home. It is a heartbreaking situation. MSF says as many as 80 people a day have been dying in the city during the past week, up from a pre-outbreak normal of 10. Another indication of just how widespread the outbreak has become is the number of healthcare professionals MSF is treating in the centre. Many members of MSF\u2019s own staff are sick. One more person has died of Covid-19 in Singapore, taking the city state\u2019s total death toll from the epidemic to 23, out of 29,812 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection. The latest death was reported by the health ministry on Thursday, as it announced another 448 coronavirus cases, mostly among migrant workers who live in dormitories. It is not clear why Singapore\u2019s death toll from coronavirus is so low. The official figures give it a Covid-19 death rate so far of about 0.08%. More bad news for Sweden, as Finland\u2019s state epidemiologist says it would be a risk for his country to accept Swedish tourists, according to a report in Swedish newspaper SVT Nyheter. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland\u2019s institute for health and welfare, and part of his country\u2019s epidemic response team, called the situation \u201cunfortunate\u201d, continuing: It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account. Sweden, SVT Nyheter\u2019s report points out, has more cases of coronavirus than all its Nordic neighbours combined. If Sweden was disappointed with the results of its seroprevalence studies for Covid-19 antibodies, its close neighbour Denmark, which did institute a strict lockdown, is even worse off. A study reported on Wednesday shows that only about 1% of Danes had contracted the coronavirus, raising concerns that the country is vulnerable to a second wave. The report was released by the Danish health agency SSI, which operates under the health ministry and is responsible for the surveillance of infectious diseases, AFP reported. Out of 2,600 randomly selected Danes, 1,071 had so far agreed to be tested for antibodies. Only 12 of those tested positive, corresponding to a rate of about 1.1%. Denmark, which quickly imposed a lockdown and strict new laws to contain the spread of Covid-19 has so far reported a total of 11,182 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 561 deaths. On Wednesday evening, the Danish parliament agreed on the next phase of opening up the country after an initial lockdown period. The country started reopening pre-schools and resuming classes for the youngest primary school children \u2013 under strict social distancing and hygiene guidelines \u2013 on 15 April. Danish middle schools followed suit this week and, with the deal struck on Wednesday, museums, movie theatres and zoos among other things would also soon reopen. In Italy, the prime minister has told off his compatriots for taking to the streets and having fun now that the country is easing its coronavirus lockdown. Giuseppe Conte said in the Italian parliament on Thursday: It\u2019s not the time for parties, nightlife or gatherings. During this phase, more than ever it\u2019s fundamental to respect security distances and wear masks, where necessary. From Palermo to Turin, images of partygoers gathering in piazzas and outside bars have caused panic among regional leaders and mayors, according to the French news agency AFP. They worry that crowds of people celebrating their freedom from quarantine may bring about another rise in infections of a disease that has already killed more than 32,000. Luca Zaia, the regional president of Veneto, was enraged after photos showed dozens of young people packed together without masks outside a bar in Padua. In 10 days, I\u2019ll see the infection rates. If they rise, we\u2019ll close bars, restaurants, beaches and we\u2019ll lock ourselves back up again. No one wants to ban spritzes but I\u2019m asking that we avoid gatherings and we wear masks until 2 June. Zaia said his Veneto region planned to make a short film showing \u201cwhat it means to go for a spritz without a mask\u201d. Notwithstanding its disappointing seroprevalence study results (see previous post), Sweden announced 40 more deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday, the lowest announced on a weekday since mid-April. The total death toll now in the country, which eschewed the kinds of compulsory lockdowns imposed across Europe in response to the coronavirus outbreak, is now 3,871, according to its public health authority\u2019s latest update. New figures also showed that 649 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus, bring the total number of cases in Sweden to 32,172. While the daily death toll in Sweden now appears to be falling, daily numbers of new infections appear to have dropped less sharply. Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, has written a full story on the results of Sweden\u2019s Covid-19 seroprevalence studies, which I first reported on the world blog yesterday. Just 7.3% of Stockholm\u2019s inhabitants had developed Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April, according to a study, raising concerns that the country\u2019s light-touch approach to the coronavirus may not be building up broad immunity, Henley writes. The research by Sweden\u2019s public health agency comes as figures suggest the country\u2019s death rate per capita has been the highest in Europe for the past seven days. Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said the antibodies figure was \u201ca bit lower than we\u2019d thought\u201d, but added that it reflected the situation three weeks ago and by now \u201ca little more than 20%\u201d of Stockholm\u2019s population had probably contracted the virus. The public health agency had previously said it expected about 25% to have been infected by 1 May and Tom Britton, a maths professor who helped develop its forecasting model, said the figure from the study was surprising. \u201cIt means either the calculations made by the agency and myself are quite wrong, which is possible, but if that\u2019s the case it\u2019s surprising they are so wrong,\u201d he told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. \u201cOr more people have been infected than developed antibodies.\u201d Dublin is famous for its pubs but many would soon rather be known as restaurants, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Dublin correspondent. Some 44% of the pubs in Ireland\u2019s capital plan to reopen as restaurants on 29 June under the third phase of the lifting of coronavirus restrictions \u2013 otherwise they need to wait until 10 August, the fifth and final phase, when pubs can reopen. That was the finding of a survey by the Licensed Vintners Association which represents publicans in Dublin. Four out of 10 members said they held restaurant certificates and hoped to hopscotch to the earlier phase. That would represent 330 of 750 pubs. Donall O\u2019Keeffe, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, said: These venues have restaurant certificates and are just as capable of following the public health guidelines as restaurants and cafes. Food is a major aspect of their business so why should they be treated differently to other venues serving food and alcohol? Pubs \u2013 as well as cafes and restaurants \u2013 will have to impose physical distancing and other measures, including a ban on standing or drinking at the bar. Damien Gayle back at the controls now, with thanks to Jess for covering my break. Remember, you can contact me with your tips, comments and suggestions for coverage either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter DM to @damiengayle. The United Nations has called on the EU to reach a deal to take in 160 migrants who have been stranded in the Mediterranean for two weeks. The UNHCR refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) urged \u201cMalta and the other European states to speed efforts to bring some 160 rescued refugees and migrants... on to dry land and to safety\u201d. The migrants are onboard two commercial vessels outside Malta\u2019s territorial waters. Malta and Italy have officially closed their ports to migrants during the coronavirus pandemic, a decision heavily criticised by aid groups. The agencies said in a statement that the migrants, a large number of whom have fled conflict-torn Libya, must be brought ashore in Malta, but other EU countries must show solidarity by accepting some of them. A clearly agreed system for post-disembarkation relocation is urgently needed if we are to finally move away from a perpetual cycle of negotiations and ad-hoc arrangements that put the lives and health of people at further risk. The statement noted that the 160 migrants had been at sea for two weeks, \u201cthe standard quarantine period for Covid-19\u201d \u2013 without any clarity on disembarkation. \u201cIt is unacceptable to leave people at sea longer than necessary, especially under difficult and unsuitable conditions.\u201d The agencies hailed the relocation of 17 people on Wednesday from Malta to France, which \u201cshows that solidarity at the time of Covid-19 is possible, with all necessary precautions and measures to ensure preventing further spreading of the virus in place\u201d. Malta, which is facing a wave of migrant arrivals, has threatened to block funding to Operation Irini, the EU\u2019s naval mission to enforce an arms embargo on Libya, if its European partners do not agree to accept some of them. Doctors and activists in Dagestan have described the death toll in the Russian region as \u201ctragically high\u201d, after officials said more than 600 people had died from pneumonia since April \u2013 far more than the official Covid-19 death toll for the region of 36. \u201cIn some towns, five to seven people were dying a day \u2026 some have seen 20 or 40 people die,\u201d said Ziyatdin Uvaisov, the head of Patient Monitor, a Dagestani NGO that advocates for the rights of patients and medics and has canvassed for information about coronavirus deaths. At least six doctors have died at a single hospital in the closed-off city of Khasavyurt. Patimat, a doctor in the cardiology department there, told the Guardian that a majority of the doctors had contracted coronavirus, including herself, and a \u201cconsiderable number\u201d had died or at one point been too sick to work. Another doctor said seven health workers had died at the hospital. Patimat said her first wave of patients fell ill after attending a funeral for another person who had died from coronavirus. \u201cPeople went in crowds to their funerals,\u201d she said. \u201cMy main wave of patients early in the epidemic told me they had been there.\u201d At the height of the crisis, Patimat said, her department ran out of oxygen to treat all the patients and could not get test results to confirm coronavirus diagnoses. She said most of the samples sent for analysis were either returned or scrapped. \u201cThere was a colossal shortage of medicines and equipment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never expected waves [of patients] like this.\u201d Scotland will begin \u201ca careful easing\u201d of coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week with the reopening of some outdoor activities after a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d reduction in cases, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said. \u201cThe time is right to move towards a careful easing of the lockdown restrictions,\u201d Sturgeon said as she announced that sports such as golf, tennis and fishing would be allowed from 28 May, while people would be permitted to meet one other person from outside their household. Travel restrictions will be eased for people to visit locations near their homes for recreation purposes. Outdoor businesses such as garden centres and construction sites will also reopen, although non-essential indoor shops, cafes and bars will remain closed. The changes bring Scotland closer in line with the rest of Britain, which implemented a similar easing of restrictions last week. Sturgeon, who leads the devolved administration in Edinburgh, described prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to begin a partial lifting of lockdown measures in England last week as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. But she said on Thursday Scotland was now ready to take a \u201cproportionate and cautious first step\u201d due to the country\u2019s falling infection and death rate. Official data suggested that Scotland had now experienced three weeks of falling deaths and experts have \u201csome confidence\u201d that the R rate, which estimates the number of people each carrier of the virus infects, is now below 1.0. The overall number of coronavirus deaths in Scotland currently stands at 2,221, up 37 from Wednesday. The first phase of Sturgeon\u2019s plan will be implemented from 28 May and kept under review every three weeks, subject to \u201crigorous, ongoing\u201d review of the scientific evidence about the spread of the virus. Schools in Scotland, which has a separate education system, are scheduled to reopen from 11 August, although there will be a \u201cblended model\u201d involving all pupils partly going into school and working from home, she told reporters. Johnson is currently facing opposition on safety grounds from teaching unions and local authorities in England about plans to reopen schools to some pupils from 1 June. Several local authorities across the country have already said they would not be able to reopen on that date. Thousands of people are expected to gather in cities across Germany at the weekend to demonstrate against the government\u2019s coronavirus policies. Germany\u2019s foreign minister has warned people to distance themselves from the growing movement, which includes radical extremists, conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers and antisemites, after domestic intelligence agents warned that extremist groups were exploiting fears around the virus in order to gain support. Heiko Maas said in an interview on Thursday: If radical extremists and antisemites use demonstrations in order to stoke hatred and to divide, then everyone should keep a lot more than just a 1.5-metre distance from them. Those who spread conspiracy theories throughout the world, without a mask, without keeping the minimum distance, without any concern for others, are confusing courage with blind anger, and freedom with pure egotism. Hello everyone, this is Jessica Murray, taking over the blog briefly while Damien takes a short break. Researchers in the Netherlands have signed up 1,500 people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate blood for research into a potential treatment based on their plasma, Reuters reports. Recovered patients are generally left with blood containing antibodies or proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system to fight off the virus. The blood component that carries the antibodies can be collected and given to newly infected patients. However, blood supplies are limited because relatively few people have had the new virus and gone on to donate blood. \u201cThe whole goal is to pull the resources, put the brightest minds together, to make sure that at the earliest possibility this therapy becomes available,\u201d said Merlijn van Hasselt of blood donation firm Sanquin. \u201cIf the clinical trials go well... this might be one of the earliest treatment possibilities for patients,\u201d Van Hasselt said. On Thursday, the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment reported 27 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 5,775. So far the country has reported 44,470 confirmed cases, with another 253 announced in RIVM\u2019s daily update. Another 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week even as states across the US began opening up for business again, betting that the coronavirus pandemic is now under control, writes Dominic Rushe in New York. The latest figures from the Department of Labor mean close to 39 million Americans have lost their jobs in just nine weeks. The rate of weekly losses has slowed sharply from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April but remains at levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. This week the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he expects unemployment to continue to rise as the pandemic takes its toll but warned of \u201cpermanent damage\u201d to the economy if the lockdowns continue too long. The weekly jobless claims are seen as a proxy for layoffs but they do not necessarily give the most accurate picture of the unemployment situation. A claim is an application for unemployment benefits and not every person who is laid off immediately applies for benefits. The weekly unemployment claims are also still being impacted by a backlog collapse of claims that overwhelmed many state systems. AstraZeneca has said it has the capacity to manufacture 1bn doses of the University of Oxford\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine and will begin supply in September if clinical trials are successful. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it had signed the first agreements to supply at least 400m doses of the potential vaccine, yet to be proven effective, which it is developing with the university. AstraZeneca said it recognised the vaccine might not work but if results from the early stage tests were positive, they would lead to late-stage trials in several countries. Only a handful of the vaccines in development have advanced to human trials, an indicator of safety and efficacy, and the stage at which most fail. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for Covid-19, which are being tested by pharmaceutical firms across the world. Governments, drugmakers and researchers are working on about 100 programmes, with experts predicting that a safe and effective means of preventing the disease could take 12 to 18 months to develop. On Monday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that if Oxford University\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine candidate proved successful, then up to 30m doses for the UK could be available by September. AstraZeneca said it has now finalised its licence agreement with Oxford University for the \u201crecombinant adenovirus vaccine\u201d, which will be known as AZD1222. East Africa is facing a \u201ctriple menace\u201d of mutually exacerbating disasters, as ongoing heavy rain hampers attempts to deal with swarms of locusts in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, the Red Cross says. Flooding has killed nearly 300 people, and displaced about 5o0,000 more who are now crammed into temporary shelters where it is difficult or impossible to stay apart to avoid catching the virus, according to the NGO. Meanwhile, the worst locust crisis in decades is ravaging crops. Simon Missiri, the Africa regional director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said: The ongoing flooding crisis is exacerbating other threats caused by COVID-19 and the invasion of locusts. Travel and movement restrictions meant to slow down the spread of COVID-19 are hampering efforts to combat swarms of locusts that are ravaging crops. Flooding is also a \u2018threat amplifier\u2019 with regards to the spread of COVID-19 as it makes it hard to implement preventive measures. We are facing an unusually complex humanitarian situation. We are worried that the number of people who are hungry and sick will increase in the coming weeks as flooding and COVID-19 continue to severely affect the coping capacity of many families in the region. Harsh weather conditions are having a multiplier effect on an already difficult situation and this could potentially lead to worrying levels of food insecurity in the region. More than 95,000 people have now tested positive for coronavirus in Africa - about 5,000 more than yesterday \u2013 according to a summary of statistics collated by the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. However, for some reason, the WHO is reporting fewer recoveries today than yesterday. In its latest update, embedded below, the UN health agency says there have been \u201cmore than 34,000 recoveries\u201d, while in yesterday\u2019s it said there had been more than 35,000. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. Comparing the two tweets shows there have been 110 deaths from Covid-19 recorded across Africa since yesterday. Sixty-six more people died from Covid-19 in Iran in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said, as a deputy health minister revealed that about 10,000 Iranian health workers have been infected with the coronavirus. In his latest update, the health ministry\u2019s spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour said Iran\u2019s total death toll from its coronavirus outbreak had now reached 7,249, while 100,564 people had recovered. In total, the country has recorded 129,341 confirmed cases, with 2,392 more people testing positive since yesterday, he was quoted as saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency. In 12 provinces, the death toll had been zero, Jahanpour added. Meanwhile, the semi-official ILNA news agency quoted a deputy health minister as saying on Thursday that some 10,000 Iranian medics had been infected, according to Reuters. Health services are stretched thin in Iran, the Middle East country hardest hit by the respiratory pandemic, with 7,249 deaths and a total of 129,341 infections. The health ministry said in April that more than 100 health workers had died of Covid-19. Madrid\u2019s city mayor has said it will reopen some of its biggest and most famous parks if the region is allowed to enter the second phase of lockdown de-escalation next week, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, the capital and the surrounding area remain in phase 0, while 70% of the country has been permitted to enter the next phase. Nineteen of the capital\u2019s most popular green spaces have been closed for more than two months in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The closure of parks including el Retiro, el Capricho and la Casa del Campo has frustrated many people since the ban on exercising outdoors was lifted at the beginning of May. \u201cOnce the new rules for phase 1 [of the lockdown lifting] have been introduced, we will proceed to the opening of these parks,\u201d the mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas said the pandemic had seen a threefold rise in the number of people seeking its help for the first time in Madrid. According to the charity, 68% of the people it helps are seeking food items, while 22% need help with living costs. The city council is providing food and economic help to some 82,000 people in the capital, while neighbourhood groups are tending to the need of another 20,000 people. A man from Tunisia drowned on Wednesday after jumping into the water from a Covid-19 quarantine ship in Sicily, writes Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo. The 28-year-old threw himself from the Moby Zaza ship, in Porto Empedocle, in the province of Agrigento, where dozens of migrants have been placed under quarantine before disembarking. The sea was rough on Wednesday and waves were 2 metres high. According to witnesses, the man jumped from a deck of the ship, from a height of around 15 metres. Prosecutors have launched an investigation and ordered an autopsy, Italy\u2019s news agency Ansa reported. Apple has launched a contact-tracing feature in the latest update of its iPhone operating system, ZDNet reports. The Covid exposure notification feature has been included in iOS 13.5 as part of Apple\u2019s partnership with Google, the other major mobile phone operating system developer, to build contact-tracing infrastructure into their software. According to ZDNet, the software will offer health authorities a way to build apps that can alert people users have come into contact with should they test positive for the coronavirus, while preserving their anonymity. An option to toggle the feature on and off can be found in the settings of the new OS, but it will not work until users install an approved app developed by a public health authority. Italian finance police arrested 10 people in Sicily, including the regional co-ordinator for the coronavirus emergency, over an alleged corruption scheme in health service tenders, Lorenzo Tondo reports from Palermo. The investigation dates back to 2016 and allegedly uncovered bribes from equipment and services contracts totalling nearly \u20ac600m (\u00a3540m). Prosecutors in Palermo seized the assets of seven companies, based in Sicily and Lombardy. According to investigators, bribes promised to public officials are thought to total \u20ac1.8m. Arrests include the head of Sicily\u2019s coronavirus response commission, Antonio Candela, 55, who has been placed under house arrest. Ironically, Candela has lived for years under police escort after, a few years ago, he publicly condemned corruption and bribes in the health system. \u201cRemember, the health system is a condominium,\u201d Candela was allegedly caught saying on wiretap. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the block chairman.\u201d Italy\u2019s Guardia di Finanza (finance police) said they had uncovered a scheme where \u2018\u2019dishonest public officials, unscrupulous businessmen and entrepreneurs were willing to do anything to obtain contracts worth millions\u201d. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, described the news as \u201can extremely serious corruption system\u201d which allegedly involved creaming off 5% commissions on public contracts. Global cases pass 5 million After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections has passed 5 million, with the Johns Hopkins University data currently listing 5,016,171. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,471 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Wuhan city bans eating wild animals In China, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak has officially banned eating wild animals. A notice on the Wuhan municipal government\u2019s website on Wednesday said that it is now prohibited to eat, hunt or breed wild animals, including terrestrial animals deemed as protected, as well as those that exist in the wild or are bred. IOC warns Tokyo Olympics will have to be scrapped if delayed beyond 2021 The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, has warned that the Tokyo Games in Japan would have to be scrapped if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible for them to take place next year. But Bach added that the IOC was committed to holding the Games, even though the outbreak could force organisers to take precautions, including quarantining athletes. Russia\u2019s Covid-19 death toll passes 3,000 The official coronavirus death toll in Russia passed 3,000 on Thursday, as a US transport plane made its way to deliver ventilators to help treat Russian patients with severe Covid-19. Officials said 127 people had died of the respiratory disease in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 3,099. The country\u2019s nationwide tally of confirmed cases of coronavirus, the world\u2019s second highest, reached 317,554, after 8,849 more people tested positive for the virus. EasyJet to resume some flights in France and UK EasyJet is to resume a small number of flights in the UK and France on 15 June, with increased safety measures on board including mandatory wearing of face masks, as it returns to the skies after grounding its entire fleet on 30 March. Afghanistan runs out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in most parts of the war-torn country. Officials warned of a human catastrophe on the eve of Eid with the potential for streets \u201cfull of dead bodies\u201d amid a continued surge of transmission across the nation, as Kabul recorded its worst day of the crisis for the second day running. Europe warned about second wave of coronavirus infections Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier cancelling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in most parts of the war-torn country, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Officials warned of a human catastrophe on the eve of Eid with the potential for streets \u201cfull of dead bodies\u201d amid continued surge of transmission across the nation, as Kabul recorded its second worst day of the crisis straight. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said that according to latest figures, \u201cmost of Covid-19 hospitals across the country and especially in Kabul are packed with patients\u201d and there is an immediate need to launch new hospitals. \u201cThe hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are packed, with no more beds. We should launch more hospitals immediately,\u201d Majroh said in a press conference in Kabul. He said that most of ICU beds are also have patients: \u201cI visited two hospitals last night, there was no empty ICU bed\u201d. According to the ministry\u2019s numbers, 19 patients are in critical condition. Majroh warned the nation on the eve of Eid, which is scheduled for the end of this week, to stay at home and avoid gatherings. Traditionally, Afghans go to their relatives and friend homes to celebrate the Eid Al-fitr, the celebration marking the end of Ramadan. Despite a government mandated lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded. Majroh said if people continue to break the rules, \u201cwe will reach to our biggest concern: streets full of dead bodies\u201d. He said the ministry is concerned about the breaking of the lockdown rules and that he had mentioned it in the Thursday morning session of the cabinet. \u201cDo stay at home during Eid and don\u2019t make the happiness of Eid into grief\u201d Majroh told the nation. \u201cIf you have doubt about the virus, just go and stay an hour in front a coronavirus hospital and look at the number of patients entering the hospital and dead bodies coming out\u201d. Meanwhile, more than half of the tests done in a 24-hour period come back positive across the country and Kabul recorded its second worst day of the crisis straight. The health ministry tested 1,007 suspected patients, of which 531 came back positive. Six deaths of Covid-19 were also recorded, pushing the total number of confirmed infections to 8,676 and the death toll to 193. Only eight recoveries were recorded in the same period. There have so far been 938 recoveries. The capital, Kabul, recorded 274 new cases out of 568 tests. The total number of confirmed cases in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area stands at 2,767 with 25 deaths. The northern province of Balkh reported two new deaths and 55 infections. The western province of Herat and the eastern province of Nangarhar, which are seeing surge in number of infections, recorded 104 new cases combined. Parwan province, north of Kabul, recorded 34 new cases. Gunmen who stormed a mosque in the province on Tuesday as people gathered to break the Ramadan fast killed at least 11. The UN\u2019s refugee agency and the World Health Organization on Thursday announced a new initiative to protect the health of the tens of millions of forcibly displaced people around the world. In a release, the UN bodies said that there were about 70 million forcibly displaced people across the world. About 26 million of them are refugees, 80% of whom are living in low- to middle-income countries with weak healthcare systems. Announcing the new agreement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said: UNHCR\u2019s long-term partnership with WHO is critical to curb the coronavirus pandemic and other emergencies \u2013 day in, day out, it is improving and saving lives of millions of people forced to flee their homes Our strengthened partnership will directly benefit refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people, and those who are stateless. It leads to better emergency response and will make the best use of the resources of both our two organisations for public health solutions across all our operations globally. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHo, said: The principle of solidarity and the goal of serving vulnerable people underpin the work of both our organisations. We stand side by side in our commitment to protect the health of all people who have been forced to leave their homes and to ensure that they can obtain health services when and where they need them. The ongoing pandemic only highlights the vital importance of working together so we can achieve more. Most of the new coronavirus infections reported by Malaysia on Thursday were detected at an immigration detention centre where authorities are holding undocumented migrants rounded up in areas under lockdown this month, according to Reuters. Of the 50 people who tested positive, 35 were being detained at the Bukit Jalil immigration detention centre, located in the outskirts of the capital Kuala Lumpur. The UN has called on Malaysia to end the crackdown, which it said has spread fear among migrant communities in Southeast Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, which has so far reported 7,059 cases, with 114 deaths. The director general of Malaysia\u2019s health ministry, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said the 35 positive cases include 17 people from Myanmar, 15 from India and one each from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Egypt. \u201cThe source of infection is still under investigation ... we need to investigate in detail before making any comments,\u201d he said. Felipe Gonzalez Morales, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants said on Wednesday that Malaysia\u2019s approach was not helping to curb the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe current crackdown and hate campaign are severely undermining the effort to fight the pandemic in the country.\u201d Th official coronavirus death toll in Russia passed 3,000 on Thursday, as a US transport plane made its way to deliver ventilators to help treat Russian patients with severe Covid-19, according to Reuters. Officials said 127 people had died of the respiratory disease in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 3,099. The country\u2019s nationwide tally of confirmed cases of coronavirus, the world\u2019s second highest, reached 317,554, after 8,849 more people tested positive for the virus. Only the US has more confirmed cases. Russia\u2019s comparatively low death toll has sparked debate about how it counts Covid-19 deaths. Although Russian officials have said there are signs the country\u2019s outbreak is stabilising, the US has said it will send 200 ventilators to Russia, making good an offer of assistance by Donald Trump. Moscow sent medical supplies to the US last month. Hi, this is Damien Gayle signing on for live blogging duties now, and with you for the next eight or so hours. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage please drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. Seriously, if you can read this story (and watch the video) about Baldomera the donkey by my esteemed colleague Sam Jones in Madrid without tearing up ...YOU ARE MADE OF STONE. Few reunions in the time of the coronavirus have been as moving, as unlikely, or quite as braying as that of Ismael Fern\u00e1ndez and Baldomera, the beloved family donkey. Video footage of the pair finding each other after being separated for two months by Spain\u2019s strict Covid-19 lockdown has been shared across social media and by newspapers and TV stations. On Monday, Fern\u00e1ndez, who lives in M\u00e1laga, took advantage of a loosening of lockdown restrictions in Andaluc\u00eda to travel to his hometown of El Borge to see Baldomera. Fears that Baldo - as the animal is affectionately known - wouldn\u2019t remember him after their eight-week separation proved unfounded. She trotted over to be stroked when he called her name, prompting sweet words and tears from Fern\u00e1ndez and honks of joy from her (although, to be fair, it\u2019s tricky to decipher donkey song). In his absence, the five-year-old donkey had been looked after by his brother. Baldo was originally bought as a present for their father, Antonio, when he retired. \u201cIt was his dream,\u201d the family told Sur newspaper. \u201cHe grew up in the country and had a donkey when he was little. But then he had to move to Torremolinos for work.\u201d The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan has removed from its website an image combining the coronavirus pandemic and the official logo of the postponed Tokyo Olympics, after the Games\u2019 organising committee complained that it was \u201cinsensitive\u201d and infringed copyright laws, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo/ The FCCJ\u2019s president, Khaldon Azhari, said at an online news conference on Thursday that the FCCJ board had decided to remove the image from the cover of April\u2019s digital edition of the organisation\u2019s in-house magazine, the Number 1 Shimbun, and voiced \u201csincere regret to anyone who may have been offended on all sides of this issue\u201d. But the decision sparked anger among many journalist members. The board did not consult regular members before agreeing to pull the image, while some accused Azhari, who is listed as a member of the Tokyo 2020 media committee, of failing to defend freedom of expression. The image, which also appeared on the cover of the print version, was a visual reference to the connection between the virus and the decision to postpone the Gamesfor a year while the world battled to contain the virus. The design combines the distinctive, spiky image of the coronavirus cellwith the blue-and-white Tokyo 2020 logo. The word \u201cCOVID-19\u201d appears beneath the image in place of the original \u201cTOKYO 2020\u201d. Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya said it was \u201cinsensitive to many people being affected\u201d by the virus, adding: It is very disappointing to see the Games emblem being distorted and associated with the novel coronavirus, which affects human life, people\u2019s lives, the economy, and our society. The design is clearly using the design of the Olympic emblem. We therefore consider it an infringement on our legally secured copyright to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic emblem. Azhari said the FCCJ board had consulted lawyers and concluded that the image likely broke Japan\u2019s strict copyright laws. We made clear from the beginning this wasn\u2019t about freedom of expression - we were most concerned about copyright. In the FCCJ\u2019s 75-year history, it has always stood as a beacon for the freedom of the press in Japan, and continues to stand for those values. And for the right of journalists to hold authorities to account. This is beyond any question. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said today that it is possible that a state of emergency in Tokyo and its surrounding regions could end as early as next week if the number of coronavirus infections continues to decrease. He said: The state of emergency will continue in Tokyo, Hokkaido and other regions. We will meet with experts (on Monday) to update the situation on infections. Abe told reporters after ending the state of emergency in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures. If the current situation continues, it is possible that the state of emergency could be lifted in those areas. Really interesting story about Rio\u2019s trans sex workers, by Dom Phillips and Ian Cheibub. Social distancing is keeping people off the streets of central Rio de Janeiro. And that has created serious challenges for its trans sex workers, who have seen their clientele, and their income, melt away. \u201cYou can see what it\u2019s like: empty streets, shops closed, the fallen economy,\u201d says Elba Tavares, 44, from Para\u00edba state in north-east Brazil. \u201cI am no longer in that rush of prostitution but yes, I sell my body.\u201d But, she says: \u201cThere are very few customers.\u201d The boss of Europe\u2019s busiest airport, Heathrow in the UK, has told the BBC that a new thermal screening trial for arriving passengers \u201ccould be part of a future common international standard to get people flying again.\u201d John Holland-Kaye, who heads up Europe\u2019s busiest airport, said the \u201cmismatch of measures\u201d currently in place across different countries was confusing. He also backed the idea of \u201cair bridges\u201d allowing travel between countries with lower infection levels to help stimulate the tourism industry. He said: There is no perfect way to make sure only healthy people fly at this stage, so we have to take a risk-based approach. As the level of transmission comes down in the UK and in other countries, we need to find a way that the vast majority of people who don\u2019t have a disease can still fly. Malaysian health authorities on Thursday reported 50 new coronavirus cases, raising the cumulative total to 7,059 cases. The health ministry also reported no new deaths, keeping total fatalities at 114. A sweet story from Australia, where one cafe where clients can feed dolphins reckons the creatures are missing human contact because they keep leaving presents. The humpback dolphins usually mingle with visitors at Barnacles Cafe &amp; Dolphin Feeding at Tin Can Bay, north of the Sunshine Coast, reports 7 News. But it\u2019s been weeks since visitors lined up to feed the animals due to coronavirus restrictions. Among the treasures the marine creatures have provided are sea sponges, barnacle-encrusted bottles and pieces of coral. On its Facebook page, the owners wrote: The pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they\u2019re missing the public interaction and attention. They are definitely missing you all. Barry McGovern, an expert in dolphin behaviour, had a slightly different take. While they miiiiiiight be leaving gifts because they missed humans, it was more likely they were missing a free lunch, he said. Nothing surprises me with dolphins and their behaviour anymore. They do everything - they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles. In all likelihood, they probably don\u2019t miss humans per se. They probably miss a free meal and the routine. The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, has warned that the Tokyo Games would have to be scrapped if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible for them to take place next year, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo. But Bach added that the IOC was committed to holding the Olympic Games in the Japanese capital next year, even though the outbreak could force organisers to take precautions, including quarantining athletes. The IOC and the Tokyo Olympic organising committee announced in March that the Games, which were due to open this July, would have to be postponed by a year due to the global spread of the virus. Bach told the BBC on Thursday he agreed with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who said last month that holding the Games would be \u201cdifficult\u201d unless the pandemic was contained before they are due to begin on 23 July next year. Bach said Abe had made it clear to him that, as far as Japan was concerned, next year was \u201cthe last option\u201d. He said: Quite frankly, I have some understanding for this, because you can\u2019t forever employ 3,000 or 5,000 people in an organising committee. You can\u2019t every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations. You can\u2019t have the athletes being in uncertainty. EasyJet is to resume a small number of flights in the UK and France on 15 June, with increased safety measures on board including mandatory wearing of face masks, as it returns to the skies after grounding its entire fleet on 30 March. The airline initially will restart domestic routes in the UK and France where it says there is sufficient customer demand to support profitable flying. Further routes will be added in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe. Read the full story here: Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed another 448 coronavirus cases, taking the city-state\u2019s tally of infections to 29,812. Tokyo\u2019s most senior prosecutor and an ally of the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is to resign after a weekly magazine revealed he had gambled illegally and ignored official advice on containing the spread of coronavirus, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo. Hiromu Kurokawa, head of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office, drew widespread criticism after the Shukan Bunshun claimed he had played mahjong for money with newspaper reporters on 1 May and 13 May, while the capital was in the midst of an ongoing coronavirus state of emergency. The games reportedly took place at the Tokyo home of an employee of the conservative Sankei Shimbun newspaper. The Kyodo news agency said on Thursday that Kurokawa \u201cintends to step down\u201d over the incident. Japanese officials have urged people to remain at home, work remotely and socially distance themselves on trips to buy food and medicine or when taking exercise, but to avoid unnecessary outings during the state of emergency. Kurokawa, 63, could face criminal charges for allegedly wagering money on mahjong. Japan\u2019s criminal code bans most forms of gambling, with publicly organised horse racing, and races involving bicycles, boats and motorbikes the only exceptions in the sports world. He was recently at the centre of a row over an attempt by Abe\u2019s government to raise the retirement age for prosecutors to 65 \u2013 a move critics saw as an attempt to keep Kurokawa on and promote him to the post of prosecutor general when the incumbent retires in July. The government abandoned the idea following a wave of criticism, including rare interventions from outraged Japanese celebrities. A meat processing plant in the Netherlands was closed on Wednesday, after 45 of its employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The Vion slaughterhouse and meat processor in Groenlo, Gelderland was ordered to close, the Dutch food and consumer product safety authority NVWA announced. Less than half of the slaughterhouse\u2019s employees have been tested so far. Here\u2019s a report from the NL Times. It comes after more than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, according to regional health authorities (see 03.53). My thanks to Guardian reader Maurice in the Netherlands for drawing my attention to this. Here\u2019s a consumer snippet from the UK, which gives a little insight into how the coronavirus lockdown has affected us. Multinational retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has said that sales of suits and ties are down to \u201ca dribble\u201d, while the top sellers right now are sportswear, sleepwear, jogging pants, hoodies and leggings \u2013 at last the working wardrobe we\u2019ve all been longing for. What customers are buying is \u201ccompletely different from what it would have been a year ago\u201d, M&amp;S chairman Archie Norman told reporters, after the 136-year-old group published annual results and its response to the pandemic. One top-selling item has baffled me though: there has been an uptick in the sale of bras. Surely the anti-lockdown purchase? I am yet to pitch my opinion piece about how lockdown achieved the goal bra-burning feminists in the 70s failed to ... but we\u2019ve got time yet. (UPDATE: My thanks to reader Prof Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, who points out that feminists didn\u2019t actually burn bras, this BBC piece tells the story behind that myth.) Anyway, despite these small boosts, things are looking very difficult for the retailer, which has taken a \u00a3145m hit on the unsold clothing piled up in its warehouses and said the huge financial toll of coronavirus would result in a \u201clost year\u201d. Read the full story here: India is set to resume domestic flights two months after the government imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, the BBC reports. The flights will start from Monday \u201cin a calibrated manner\u201d, according to the civil aviation minister. Hardeep Puri said all airports and airlines were being \u201cinformed to be ready for operations\u201d. The \u201cStandard Operations Procedures for movement of passengers will be announced on Thursday\u201d, he said. This is Lexy Topping with you on the global coronavirus live blog from London. I always love hearing from our readers around the world, so please do get in touch with any vignettes or news stories from your part of the globe. I\u2019m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you all for following along. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Alexandra Topping, who will take you through the next few hours of live news, as the number of confirmed cases worldwide passes 5 million \u2013 that\u2019s in a period of roughly five months. William Haseltine, the groundbreaking cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects researcher, has said the best approach to the pandemic is to manage the disease through careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures whenever it starts spreading. He said that while a vaccine could be developed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it\u201d, and urged people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. The United States and other countries has not done enough to \u201cforcibly isolate\u201d people exposed to the virus, Haseltine said, but praised China, South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s efforts to curb infections. Haseltine said the US, Russia and Brazil \u2013 which rank first, second and third for infections \u2013 have done the worst. The total number of confirmed cases worldwide has passed 5 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current total is 5,000,038. Differing testing rates and definitions (for example excluding cases in aged care homes from national totals), underreporting, and time lags mean that that the true number of infections is certainly higher. Cases first emerged in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. The sombre milestone comes after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. The increase prompted the World Health Organization to issue a stark warning on Wednesday: the coronavirus pandemic is far from over. The US has the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide, with 1,551,853. A 10-minute home saliva test for coronavirus is under development in a deal struck between the billionaire co-founder of online fashion brand BooHoo and a Cambridge-based firm. The antigen test, which would be available to buy, will look similar to a pregnancy test but will use a saliva sample rather than urine, and is designed to give a result within 10 minutes: The city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak has officially banned eating wild animals. A notice on the Wuhan municipal government\u2019s website on Wednesday said that it is now prohibited to eat, hunt or breed wild animals, including terrestrial animals deemed as protected, as well as those that exist in the wild or are bred. The new rules, to be in effect for five years, also bar the consumption of rare and endangered aquatic animals. The new rules in Wuhan come days before the opening of China\u2019s legislature this week as local governments signal they are on board with nationally announced policies. China\u2019s wildlife industry - where animals are used for food and traditional Chinese medicine - has come under scrutiny after researchers said the virus may have come from the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, where a small number of vendors sold wild animals. In January, a temporary ban on the wildlife trade was put in place and in February, China\u2019s top legislature promised to fast-track a permanent ban on the trade. Organisers of Hong Kong\u2019s Tiananmen Square vigil have urged people to \u201cbe water\u201d and find their own ways to hold commemorations after coronavirus bans on gatherings were extended. The annual event marking the 1989 brutal crackdown by the Chinese army on protesters is traditionally the largest and only authorised commemoration of the massacre anywhere in China. However on Tuesday Hong Kong authorities extended until 4 June physical distancing laws limiting public gatherings to eight people, while relaxing other restrictions. Hong Kong police have cited the extension in refusing permission for a march on 4 June, and organisers expect refusal for the evening vigil. Lee Cheuk-Yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said the decision to extend the limits was \u201cclearly a political one\u201d, telling the Guardian: \u201cWhen you allow schools to reopen on May 27, when you allow religious gatherings to resume, when you allow even swimming pools to open and business activity will soon all reopen, but then you just ban gatherings? Thailand on Thursday reported three new coronavirus infections and no new deaths, bringing the total to 3,037 confirmed cases and 56 fatalities since the outbreak started in January. The new cases included two domestic transmissions and one infection found in quarantine in an individual returning to Thailand from the Philippines, said spokesman for the government\u2019s coronavirus task force, Taweesin Wisanuyothin. Global cases near 5 million. After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections is close to 5 million, with the Johns Hopkins University data currently listing 4,996,634. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,120 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Japan to lift state of emergency in Osaka and two other prefectures. Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighbouring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido. Migrant boat crossings to UK surge during virus lockdown. The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks. Kent County Council in southeast England, which includes the major port of Dover, was dealing with \u201c230 to 250\u201d young migrants a year ago, its chief executive, Roger Gough, said. Mexico suffers record one-day death toll. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday registered 2,248 new coronavirus infections and an additional 424 fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities. World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address. South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. More than 100 virus infections in French slaughterhouse. More than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, the regional health authorities said Wednesday. The cases follow coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants not only in France but also in Germany, Spain, Australia, the United States and Brazil - where people tend to work in close proximity. The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks. Kent County Council in southeast England, which includes the major port of Dover, was dealing with \u201c230 to 250\u201d young migrants a year ago, its chief executive, Roger Gough, said. \u201cBut that number has pretty much doubled. It\u2019s now nearly 470 and new arrivals are coming in all the time,\u201d he told AFP. At least 1,000 migrants have arrived in Britain by small boats since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced virus lockdown measures on March 23, according to a count by the domestic Press Association news agency. At least 145 arrived on May 8, it added. Of those, 17 were unaccompanied minors. Another three arrived the same weekend, said Gough. Most were Iranians, Iraqis and Afghans. \u2018It\u2019s a disaster\u2019: Egypt\u2019s doctors plead for more PPE and testing Ruth Michaelson reports for the Guardian: Egyptian doctors are increasingly at odds with their own government on the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, pleading for protections and a full lockdown even as the authorities urge people to learn to \u201ccoexist\u201d with Covid-19. A wave of government propaganda has hailed healthcare workers as the \u201cwhite army\u201d, a reference to their white coats. But some of them told the Guardian they lacked protective equipment and were struggling to get vital tests for themselves and patients. \u201cThe situation is deteriorating. The nurses and doctors are very scared because we are not protected,\u201d said a nurse at a hospital in Imbaba, Giza. \u201cWe are treated the same way patients are treated. If we complain of symptoms, we are asked to go home and quarantine, but we are not allowed to be tested.\u201d South Korea\u2019s professional football league has imposed a record fine on one of its clubs for placing sex dolls in empty seats during a recent match played without spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the K-League fined FC Seoul 100m won ($81,000), saying the club had \u201cdeeply humiliated\u201d female football fans and damaged the 38-year-old league\u2019s reputation. League officials accepted FC Seoul\u2019s claim that it did not know the mannequins were sex toys, but said it \u201ccould have easily recognised their use using common sense and experience\u201d. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 745 to 176,752, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 57 to 8,147, the tally showed. Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighboring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido, AP reports. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo. The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement. The three are among the eight prefectures still under the emergency status after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the measure last week in all but eight of the 47 Japanese prefectures. Abe declared the state of emergency on 7 April in parts of Japan including Tokyo and later expanded it to nationwide. Abe will formally announce the plan later Thursday after approval by parliamentary committees. Japan has about 16,424 confirmed cases and 777 deaths as of Wednesday, according to the health ministry. Baghdad, Iraq, a city of nearly ten million residents, is running on an unusual rhythm this Ramadan since Iraq imposed an overnight curfew to curb the spreading coronavirus, AFP reports. A few hours before dawn, the wailing voice of Sayyed Mozahem rings out across a small neighbourhood in old Baghdad, amplified by his portable microphone. Mozahem is the neighbourhood \u201cmusaharati\u201d, responsible during Ramadan for reminding Muslims to have their final meal before a new day of fasting begins with the sunrise. \u201cFasters, wake up,\u201d he chants, marching through the streets to the beat of his traditional drum as his older brother and father did before him. But his refrains have a special twist: \u201cMay Ramadan keep the coronavirus away,\u201d and \u201cGod, spare Iraq from Covid-19\u201d. Iraqis are adapting their Ramadan routines to fit a curfew from 5pm until 5am - the hours Baghdad usually comes alive with huge fast-breaking feasts, late-night runs for sweets and midnight mosque visits. Instead, Iraqis are rushing through checkpoints before the lockdown starts, praying alone at home and baking traditional sweets usually bought in stores. A sombre and isolating mood has settled over the capital, where the response to the novel coronavirus has left its mark from dawn until dusk. \u2018Could be a bit strange\u2019: New Zealand bars to reopen but fun is kept at arm\u2019s length Dancing, hook-ups and bar banter will be off the menu as New Zealand\u2019s pubs and bars re-open on Thursday night, with some saying the social distancing requirements will make for a \u201csad and strange\u201d atmosphere in the nation\u2019s party hotspots. Last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern moved the country from coronavirus lockdown Level 3 to Level 2, meaning most shops and restaurants could reopen, as well as schools, workplaces and public amenities. However, on advice from the Ministry of Health, bars and nightclubs remained closed for an additional week, because people\u2019s close proximity meant they were deemed particularly high risk. One of the country\u2019s largest outbreaks was spread at a St Patrick\u2019s Day gathering at a Matamata pub in the North Island. On Thursday night, pubs may finally open their doors but for some capacity will be more than halved because customers must remain seated at socially distanced tables and be waited on by a dedicated server: the social \u201cbar\u201d of a bar is off-limits and no one is allowed to mingle with other tables \u2013 though shouting across the room will be permitted, some bar managers said. A study shows that only about one percent of Danes had contracted the coronavirus, Danish officials said Wednesday, raising concerns Denmark is vulnerable to a new wave. The report was released by the Danish health agency SSI, which operates under the health ministry and is responsible for the surveillance of infectious diseases. Out of 2,600 randomly selected Danes, 1,071 had so far agreed to be tested for antibodies. Only 12 of those tested positive, corresponding to a rate of about 1.1%. SSI cautioned that the results were preliminary and there were several factors that made it difficult to say whether the results were indicative of the entire Danish population. Experts interviewed by broadcaster DR said the results were concerning and showed that the country was vulnerable to the spread of the virus picking up speed again. Denmark on Wednesday reported a total of 11,117 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 554 deaths. Meanwhile, the parties of the country\u2019s parliament agreed on the next phase of opening up the country after an initial lockdown period. More than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, the regional health authorities said Wednesday. The cases follow coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants not only in France but also in Germany, Spain, Australia, the United States and Brazil - where people tend to work in close proximity. A total of 109 personnel have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, at a slaughterhouse in Cotes d\u2019Armor following a second wave of testing, the ARS regional health authority said in a statement. Some 818 people have been tested at the plant, it added. Those diagnosed as having the disease are being contacted by employee insurance firms that have identified all their contacts at risk of catching the illness, requiring them to respect two-week quarantines, take tests and wear masks, the ARS said. Plant operator Kermene, according to its website, said it supplies E.Leclerc supermarkets with meat and meat products. Lufthansa airlines on Thursday confirmed it was in talks with the German government over a \u20ac9bn (US$10bn) rescue that will see Berlin take a massive stake in the coronavirus-stricken airline. \u201cThe concept, which has not yet been finalised, provides for stabilisation measures in the amount of up to nine billion euros, of which \u20ac3bn is in the form of a loan\u201d from public investment bank KfW, the German aviation giant said in a statement. If agreed, the solution would close weeks of wrangling over Lufthansa between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU conservatives and their centre-left junior partners the SPD. If plans go ahead, it would be the first time the government has held a stake in the former flag carrier since 1997. But around 700 of Lufthansa\u2019s 760 aircraft are currently parked at airports and more than 80,000 of its 130,000 staff are on part-time work schemes. In April, the group was carrying fewer than 3,000 passengers daily compared with a pre-pandemic average of around 350,000 a day. Chief executive Carsten Spohr has said Lufthansa - which also includes subsidiaries Austrian and Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and Swiss - is bleeding \u201cabout a million euros in liquidity reserves per hour. Day and night. Week by week.\u201d Michael Cohen to be released from prison and serve sentence at home Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, will be released from federal prison Thursday and is expected to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. Cohen has been serving a federal prison sentence at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. Prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the justice department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6ft away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars. Cohen was told last month he would be released to serve the rest of his three-year sentence at home in response to concerns about coronavirus. He had told associates he was expecting to be released earlier this month. A federal judge had denied Cohen\u2019s attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it \u201cappears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle\u201d. But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order. The Bureau of Prisons said last week that more than 2,400 inmates had been moved to home confinement since Barr first issued his memo on home confinement in late March, and 1,200 others had been approved and were expected to be released in the coming weeks. Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars in the federal prison system. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was released on home confinement last week. Michael Avenatti, the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, was temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and is staying at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles.

After nearly two months sidelined in Guam with a coronavirus outbreak, the USS Theodore Roosevelt has gone out to sea for training, in preparation to return to duty in the Pacific. The ship has been docked in Guam since 27 March, as the 4,800 crew members went through rotations of quarantine, and more than 1,000 of them have tested positive for the virus over that time. \u201cIt feels great to be back at sea,\u201d Rear Admiral Stu Baker, commander of Carrier Strike Group 9, said in a statement. \u201cGetting Theodore Roosevelt and Carrier Air Wing 11 one step closer to returning to their mission in the Indo-Pacific is a great achievement for the crew.\u201d In an Associated Press interview from the aircraft carrier earlier this week, Navy Captain Carlos Sardiello said the ship will sail with a scaled-back crew of about 3,000, leaving about 1,800 sailors on shore who are still in quarantine or working with those who are. The sailors in quarantine include up to 14 who recently tested positive again for the virus, just days after getting cleared to return to the carrier. Here is a video of US president Donald Trump saying China\u2019s coronavirus numbers \u201cweren\u2019t correct\u201d, before adding it has \u201cbeen easily shown and easily proven\u201d. He did not provide any evidence. The president made the comments during a meeting with the governors of Arkansas and Kansas, after explaining case numbers in the US were favourable if outbreaks in New York and New Jersey were not included. When asked by a journalist leaving the room at the end of the meeting, Trump added his hydroxychloroquine regimen finishes in \u201cabout two days\u201d: Eight soccer players at Mexico\u2019s Santos Laguna club have tested positive for coronavirus but none of them are displaying any symptoms, the Mexican governing body, Liga MX, said on Wednesday. The Mexican league was suspended on 15 March due to the coronavirus outbreak and officials have not indicated when it would restart. The players at Santos Laguna had all been tested since Monday, the league said. Neither Liga MX nor the club released the names of the footballers who tested positive. \u201cThese players will be observed and the health of all the Liga MX players will be constantly monitored,\u201d Liga MX said in a statement. Mexico has registered 56,594 coronavirus infections and 6,090 deaths in total. Earlier on Wednesday, health officials reported 424 new fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. \u2018Bring our boys back home\u2019: rugby team from Tonga trapped in New Zealand due to Covid-19 Leni Maiai reports for the Guardian from Auckland: For the past six weeks, the days have followed a particular pattern for the players and coaching staff of the Tu\u2019uakitau rugby team from Tonga. They get up from their beds \u2013 mattresses on the floor of a church in Auckland where they are locked down \u2013 pray, sing hymns, eat a breakfast made of donated food, and then train. The 29-strong squad is stuck 2,000km from their home in Tonga, stranded in New Zealand after their Pacific home shut its borders to all travellers, including citizens. The team from Ha\u2019apai, a remote cluster of islands in central Tonga, arrived in New Zealand on 3 March, intending to spend a month playing club rugby teams around the North Island, before heading home. Team Tu\u2019uakitau had spent months preparing for the trip, training, and fundraising. Players were hoping to be scouted for contracts on New Zealand teams; a potential pathway to residency for them and their families. A week and a half into the tour, opposition coaches began calling to cancel their upcoming games and they realised the gravity of the Covid-19 situation: China recorded two new coronavirus cases for 20 May, down from five a day earlier, the National Health Commission (NHC) reported on Thursday. One of the new cases was a local transmission, in Shanghai, and one was a so-called imported case involving a traveller from overseas, the commission said in a statement. China also reported one imported case the previous day. The NHC reported 31 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, up from 16 a day earlier. The total number of Covid-19 infections in China to date now stands at 82,967. The death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. Tokyo\u2019s top prosecutor was set to resign after a report that he gambled illegally during Japan\u2019s coronavirus state of emergency, media said on Thursday, in a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose support has been hit over his handling of the pandemic, Reuters reports. Hiromu Kurokawa, the chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office, was due to resign, public broadcaster NHK said, citing a source. Other media had similar reports. Kurokawa was hit with a social media backlash over a media report that he allegedly played mahjong for money during Japan\u2019s state of emergency, potentially flouting social distancing guidelines. Gambling is illegal in Japan, with some exceptions. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report or reach anyone at the prosecutors office for comment. No one was immediately available at the justice ministry outside of normal business hours. Kurokawa, who is seen as close to Abe, has been at the centre of a furore over the government\u2019s efforts to raise the retirement age for prosecutors after he was allowed to stay in his post beyond retirement age of 63. Ecuador\u2019s largest city, Guayaquil, allowed some businesses to reopen on Wednesday following a fall in daily deaths from the coronavirus pandemic that had for weeks required the city to remain in quarantine, Reuters reports. Guayaquil in March and April faced a brutal outbreak of the virus that left hospitals overwhelmed and authorities struggling to collect the bodies of presumed Covid-19 victims. Public transportation and private vehicles were again circulating in the coastal city on Wednesday and open air markets and shopping malls began opening their doors. Bars, restaurants and movie theaters remain closed. Guayaquil\u2019s municipal government said in a social media video that daily death rates linked to Covid-19 in Guayaquil had dropped to around 10 per day in May from a peak of 460 in April. \u201cIn the home there is hunger, outside there is the coronavirus,\u201d Mayor Cynthia Viteri told reporters. \u201cWe have to find a balance so that people can work and take care of themselves.\u201d Municipal offices opened to the public with limited hours. The city is maintaining a curfew and some restrictions on vehicle traffic. Domestic and international flights remain halted. Ecuador officially has 34,854 infections and 2,888 deaths from the virus. But the government recognizes that the figures are probably much higher because of limited testing. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday registered 2,248 new coronavirus infections and an additional 424 fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has told the Washington Post \u2013 in an interview about US President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to deliver a vaccine by the end of the year, in what the White House has called \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d \u2013 that he is concerned this name will make people worry that their safety could be at risk. Fauci said in the interview, \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand that, because when they hear \u2018Operation Warp Speed,\u2019 they think, \u2018Oh, my God, they\u2019re jumping over all these steps and they\u2019re going to put us at risk.\u201d The Washington Post writes: No steps would be eliminated, [Dr Fauci] vowed. Rather, multiple steps \u2014 from collecting data to preparing to scale up the number of potential doses \u2014 would be pursued at once, creating \u201crisk for the investment\u201d but not for the patient or the \u201cintegrity of the study.\u201d Colombia\u2019s capital Bogota is using police drones to detect people with high temperatures or those violating the country\u2019s coronavirus quarantine, Reuters reports. If a drone detects someone with a potential fever it sends the location to a medical team that seeks out the person to determine if they have coronavirus symptoms, officials said on Wednesday. \u201cIt facilitates the location of groups of people day or night,\u201d said Captain Jorge Humberto Caceres, head of the police drone unit, as he monitored an area of northern Bogota with a thermal camera-equipped drone. \u201cIt gives us an approximate body temperature and directs the case to a national system so it can be attended to.\u201d The drones only detect temperatures or groupings of people who are out on the street, the police said, and do not penetrate into houses or apartments. The country has been in a coronavirus lockdown for nearly two months. Bogota - home to some 8 million people - has more than a third of Colombia\u2019s nearly 17,000 coronavirus cases. In case you missed this Guardian exclusive: The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, speaks frankly in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began. Earlier this month the former hospital doctor, who worked through the various levels of healthcare bureaucracy to be become ECDC director in 2017, announced that, as of 2 May, Europe as a whole had passed the peak of infections. Only Poland was technically not yet there, she said. European governments have started easing their lockdown restrictions, some to the extent that bars and restaurants will soon reopen, others rather more tentatively. Boris Johnson has tweaked his message to Britons from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d and is seeking to send pupils back into schools in a fortnight. After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections is close to 5 million, with the Johns Hopkins University data currently listing 4,968,133. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 326,464 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Here are the 15 worst-affected countries by total cases: US: 1,548,646 (Deaths: 93,214) Russia: 308,705 (Deaths: 2,972) Brazil: 271,628 (Deaths: 17,971) United Kingdom: 249,616 (Deaths: 35,785) Spain: 232,555 (Deaths: 27,888) Italy: 227,364 (Deaths: 32,330) France: 181,700 (Deaths: 28,135) Germany: 178,473 (Deaths: 8,144) Turkey: 152,587 (Deaths: 4,222) Iran: 126,949 (Deaths: 7,183) India: 112,028 (Deaths: 3,434) Peru: 104,020 (Deaths: 3,024) China: 84,063 (Deaths: 4,638) Canada: 81,530 (Deaths: 6,147) Saudi Arabia: 62,545 (Deaths: 339) Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. As the world sees the highest daily increase in confirmed cases so far \u2013 with 106,000 cases in 24 hours \u2013 the World Health Organization has warned that the pandemic is far from over. \u201cWe still have a long way to go in this pandemic. We are very concerned about rising cases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said. Meanwhile Europe\u2019s director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the agency responsible for advising governments, including the UK, on disease control, has said that Europe should brace for a second wave of infections \u2013 \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon. \u201cLooking at the characteristics of the virus, looking at what now emerges from the different countries in terms of population immunity \u2013 which isn\u2019t all that exciting, between 2% and 14%, that leaves still 85% to 90% of the population susceptible \u2013 the virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February \u2026 I don\u2019t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax,\u201d she said. Here are the top developments from the last few hours: World sees largest daily rise in cases. The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown. Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020. Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address. South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said. France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system. The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months. The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid. Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises.",
