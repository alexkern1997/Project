      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government will walk away from its planned $810m redevelopment of the former Olympic stadium in Sydney as the state grapples with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, will announce that the state government will dump the stadium redevelopment, a key but controversial plank of its election pitch last year, instead announcing a $3bn fund for smaller, \u201cshovel-ready projects\u201d. The announcement will come a day before NSW seeks to boost its flailing economy by further loosening the lockdown restrictions introduced at the height of the pandemic, including increasing the number of patrons allowed at venues from 10 to 50 and allowing regional travel for the first time since March. In a statement issued to media before a formal announcement, Berejiklian said the decision to dump the stadium redevelopment was part of a wider plan to increase the state\u2019s infrastructure spend to about $100bn. \u201cThis guaranteed pipeline of $100bn will be our best chance of supporting the hundreds of thousands of people who have already lost their jobs in NSW,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cWe are now not only guaranteeing our infrastructure pipeline, we will be looking for opportunities to fast-track projects to provide jobs as early as we can.\u201d But Berejiklian will say on Sunday that the government\u2019s controversial $1.1bn decision to relocate the Powerhouse Museum to Parramatta will go ahead. The premier says the project, which is opposed by NSW Labor, the Greens and the crossbench Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, will create 1,100 construction jobs in western Sydney. Coupled with the rebuild of the former Sydney Football Stadium at Moore Park, the planned redevelopment of the former Olympic stadium was a key plank of the government\u2019s re-election pitch.. It would have seen the Homebush stadium converted into a 70,000-seat venue with a rectangular playing field which would have hosted major events in the city including the NRL grand final and State of Origin matches. But in the media statement, the deputy premier, John Barilaro, said the economic pain wrought by Covid-19 had forced the government to abandon the plan. \u201cThe communities of NSW have been through an incredibly tough period with continued drought, horrific bushfires and now Covid-19 and the best path to recovery is creating jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAn unprecedented crisis calls for an unprecedented recovery and redirecting funding from Stadium Australia to job-creating infrastructure builds is the right thing to do for the people of NSW.\u201d As Covid-19 infection rates in NSW continue to fall, the state will from Monday increase the number of patrons allowed in cafes, restaurants, bars and places of worship from 10 to 50.

The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities. Our new blog can be found at the link below: Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. In Australia, residents in the country\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, are enduring one more day of tight Covid restrictions before pubs, beauty salons and museums reopen and intrastate holiday travel is permitted, AAP reports. For the first time in almost three weeks, zero Covid-19 cases were reported in NSW on Saturday, from 9500 tests. A marketing campaign spruiking NSW as a tourist destination will target NSW, Victorian and ACT residents as coronavirus-related travel restrictions ease. The state government on Sunday said a major tourism marketing push would coincide with the restriction changes. Travellers from interstate will also be able to visit NSW under the changes, but must comply with the rules of their home state when returning. The next phase of the \u201cnow\u2019s the time to love NSW\u201d campaign \u2013 first announced earlier this year after bushfires devastated the state \u2013 will include a new television commercial and social media video series, and international digital advertising to keep the state in overseas visitors\u2019 minds. \u201cInterest in NSW road trips has jumped with a 125% increase in page views on VisitNSW.com in the past week,\u201d Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres said in a statement on Sunday. Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit from Brexit and coronavirus Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week. However, an impact assessment of ending the transition period found that manufacturing, banking, finance and insurance sectors would be \u201cseverely exposed\u201d to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus. The Social Market Foundation analysis divided the country into areas and then placed each in a category between 1 and 5, with 5 representing those most exposed to a double hit. Half of those in the north-west are in category 5 and a further 40% in category 4. It said that the West Midlands, where the Tories made major gains in last year\u2019s election, was also exposed. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news for the next few hours. As always, you can get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Here some key developments of the last few hours at a glance: Pope Francis implored world leaders on Saturday to act wisely and generously to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned prime minister Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms. Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban paid a 3,000 lei fine ($690) on Saturday for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks.Russia to start vaccine trial within two weeks Russian scientists plan to start clinical coronavirus vaccine trials within two weeks, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Avifavir. Greece will conduct coronavirus tests on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency EASA when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. The list currently includes 13 airports in the United Kingdom, all those in 22 US states and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris. Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals are planning a national march for Monday to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world. South Africa\u2019s infection cases now exceed 30,000, the country\u2019s health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. The death toll increased by 32 to 643. Pakistan has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days, and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days. Colombia is to lift quarantine measures in parts of the country, but issued new measures to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital Bogota. The country has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths. New York state governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill on Saturday that will grant death benefits to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation. That\u2019s all from me for today, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Australia. A demonstration for justice for George Floyd in the city of Pittsburgh in the US state of Pennsylvania has escalated, with reports of journalists getting kicked and beaten and shop windows being broken. Pittsburgh\u2019s Public Safety agency urged people to avoid the downtown area. As protests swept across the US on Saturday, some rallies became violent, while others remained largely peaceful, although some crowds seemed to disregard the risk of coronavirus transmission. Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms set a curfew starting Saturday at 9pm ET and lasting until sunrise Sunday. The city said the curfew was issued because of the \u201crecent acts of violence demonstrated throughout the city.\u201d Liberian president George Weah, a former international football legend, has released a song to be used by the UN to spread awareness about the new coronavirus, his office said Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse. Weah hopes to appeal to music lovers across the West African nation of some 4.5 million people to ensure Covid-19 does not spread further. It is not the first time Weah has used his singing skills. During the 2014 Ebola crisis, when he was a senator, he released an awareness song. \u201cThe song, Let\u2019s Stand Together to Fight Corona, will be a part of the second phase of UNESCO\u2019s \u001dDontGoViral campaign, which they say is aimed at informing and sensitising communities across Africa about the dangers of the disease,\u201d Weah\u2019s office said. Mexican healthcare workers are trying to get the pandemic under control without appropriate protection. Health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world. The risks are made worse by shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). As a nurse on the front lines of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus battle, Gisela Hernandez has stayed away from her children for nearly two months, sleeping in a hotel and even her car to avoid infecting them because she feels inadequately protected at work, Reuters reports. At night, she video calls Santiago, 5 and Renata, 9, who are both asthmatic, to hear about what they\u2019ve done during the day and remind them how much she misses them. While Hernandez says she loves her work, and considers the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City her second home, she is also afraid of contracting coronavirus, which has killed 9,415 people in Mexico. \u201cI don\u2019t regret becoming a nurse because I like to help my patients,\u201d said Hernandez, 40, whose hospital is one of the city\u2019s main treatment centers for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. But she said she is \u201cscared of getting sick ... scared of never seeing my kids again.\u201d Coronavirus cases are surging in Latin America, which along with the United States is now an epicenter of the global pandemic. Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals, including Hernandez, have taken to the streets to complain about the conditions. A national march is planned for Monday. The more than 2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors from Monday for the first time in 10 weeks, Reuters reports. The government said on Saturday that the 2.2 million will be able to go outside with members of their household, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. Those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household. \u201cI do not underestimate just how difficult it has been for you, staying at home for the last 10 weeks, and I want to pay tribute to your resilience,\u201d prime minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. Those shielding remain at risk however and the government said they should only leave the house once a day, not go to work or the shops and should avoid crowded places where they cannot social distance. Support provided to those with serious medical complications, such as the delivery of food, medicines and phone calls, will continue. Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak is worsening still, as the country now has at least 28,015 Covid-19 deaths, and 469,510 detected infections in total, according to Worldometers. On Friday, Brazil reported 26,417 new cases, the country\u2019s largest daily increase by far, as well as 1,156 new deaths. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly dismissed the risks from coronavirus, defied his own government\u2019s advice and pushed states to reopen beauty parlours as the death toll climbed - displaying an overall attitude world leaders such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have shared during the pandemic. Brazil\u2019s most densely populated favela, Parais\u00f3polis, in Sao Paulo, was forced to react and set up an informal emergency care system, the Intercept reports. South Africa\u2019s detected coronavirus infections now exceed 30,000, the country\u2019s health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday. South Africa reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. The death toll increased by 32 to 643. As massive protests erupted across US cities following the police killing of a handcuffed black man in Minnesota, George Floyd, some city leaders uttered fears of a new surge in coronavirus infections, the Associated Press reports. Minnesota\u2019s governor Tim Walz said Saturday that too many protesters weren\u2019t socially distancing or wearing masks and seemed undeterred by the infection risk. \u201cWhether they\u2019re fired up or not, that doesn\u2019t prevent them from getting the virus,\u201d said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Others were more sympathetic towards the demonstrators. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, acknowledged a connection between Floyd\u2019s killing and the disproportionately high death toll among people from ethnic minorities. Atlanta\u2019s police chief Erika Shields said in a video interview that angry reactions were understandable as black lives were \u201cbeing diminished\u201d. Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned prime minister Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal that has dominated British media for more than a week now, after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, at the end of March, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus. Cummings\u2019s relaxed interpretation of lockdown rules drew condemnation from across the country and political spectrum. In a letter sent to No 10 on Friday, 26 senior UK academics and health administrators warn that public faith in the government is essential if the Covid-19 crisis is to be tackled effectively. However, they make clear that trust has been \u201cbadly damaged by the recently reported actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest\u201d, and by the prime minister\u2019s refusal to dismiss him. My colleagues Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Michael Savage have more: Botswana will help repatriate citizens stranded abroad by coronavirus travel bans, with more than 100 due to arrive on Wednesday from Ethiopia, president Mokgweetsi Masisi said on Saturday. Botswana ended a 48-day lockdown a week ago, allowing businesses and schools to reopen under strict conditions but its borders are still closed with only returning citizens and essential goods allowed in, according to Reuters. \u201cIn order to alleviate the plight of our citizens abroad who have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, mostly students and those affected by the global travel bans, we have decided to assist them with financial assistance to either cope where they are or to return them home,\u201d Masisi said in a televised speech. Masisi said the government has helped 400 return from South Africa and neighbouring countries. Botswana has recorded just 35 coronavirus cases and one death, but the economy has been severely hit, with real gross domestic product forecast to contract by 13% in 2020. Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban paid a 3,000 lei fine ($690) on Saturday for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors, state news agency Agerpres said. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks. Their masks were thrown on the table. In a statement, Orban acknowledged breaching the rules, saying some cabinet members gathered at his office after a long working day on 25 May, his 57th birthday, Reuters reports. \u201cThe prime minister knows rules must be obeyed by all citizens, regardless of their position. If the law is broken then sanctions must be enforced,\u201d the agency quoted the statement as saying. After 60 days of strict lockdown during a state of emergency which expired on 15 May, Orban\u2019s government ordered a 30-day state of alert, when wearing masks became mandatory in public transport and in closed public spaces. Smoking indoors has been banned in Romania since 2016. Restaurants with outdoor seating are due to reopen under strict restrictions on Monday. Romania reported 19,133 cases of the new coronavirus on Saturday, 151 cases more on the day, and 1,253 deaths. Russian scientists plan to start clinical trials within two weeks on a vaccine to combat coronavirus, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Reuters reports. Russia has the world\u2019s third-highest toll of coronavirus infections after the United States and Brazil, and Kremlin officials have said the nation\u2019s researchers are working on almost 50 different vaccine projects. \u201cThe tests are under way and we plan to start clinical trials in the next two weeks,\u201d health minister Mikhail Murashko was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency. He said volunteers had been selected to take part in the trials. Drugmakers worldwide are rushing to develop treatments and vaccines for the virus that has caused 364,000 deaths globally. There are currently about 10 coronavirus vaccines being tested in humans and experts have predicted that a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months from the start of development. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said the health ministry had approved Avifavir for the treatment of Covid-19. It was developed on the basis of a drug known generically as favipiravir. RDIF said Avifavir had proved highly effective in treating patients with coronavirus in the first phase of its clinical trials. The final stage of clinical trials is under way, with the participation of 330 patients. One of the Russian vaccine projects is being undertaken by the state-run Vektor Institute in Siberia, whose director general, Rinat Maksyutov, said on Saturday he hoped to complete clinical trials in mid-September. Maksyutov said vaccine trials on animals had been successful. Greece said on Saturday it will conduct coronavirus tests on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency EASA when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June, Reuters reports. EASA regularly updates a list of airports located in affected areas with high risk of transmission of the Covid-19 infection, which include 13 in the United Kingdom, all those in 22 US states and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris. \u201cIf you originate from an airport on the EASA affected area list, then you will be tested upon arrival,\u201d the ministry of foreign affairs said in an announcement, adding that movement restrictions will also apply. \u201cIf the test is negative, then the passenger self-quarantines for 7 days. If the test is positive, the passenger is quarantined under supervision for 14 days.\u201d Visitors arriving from other areas will be randomly tested upon arrival. Greece released a first list of 29 countries it considered safe on Friday and said it would be reviewed again before 1 July. \u201cIt will now depend on airport of origin, not country [of origin],\u201d a government official told AFP. The Mediterranean nation, which emerged from a decade-long debt crisis in late 2018, relies heavily on tourism - about 20% of its output - for its economic recovery. A nationwide lockdown imposed in March helped Greece contain the spread of infections to just below 3,000 cases, a relatively low number compared with elsewhere in the European Union. But it brought the tourism sector to a virtual standstill, with Greece\u2019s economy expected to contract by up to 10% this year. Pope Francis begged world leaders on Saturday to act wisely and generously to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. The pope prayed for an end to the coronavirus pandemic and the development of a vaccine as he presided over an outdoor gathering on Saturday that signalled a semblance of normalcy returning to the Vatican, after a coronavirus lockdown lasting more than two months, the Associated Press reports. Francis was joined in the Vatican Gardens by a sampling of people on the front lines of the emergency: a doctor, a nurse, a hospital chaplain, a pharmacist, a journalist and a civil protection official. A recovered Covid-19 patient, a person with a relative who died during Italys outbreak, and the parents of a baby born during the emergency also were among the pope\u2019s more than 100 guests for the prayer. They sat spaced far apart, and most wore protective masks. Francis didn\u2019t. He noted that many virus victims died alone due to hospitals needing to prohibit visitors and that the dead were buried sometimes in a way that wounds the soul. The prayer service, held on a cool evening in the Vatican Gardens, marked Francis biggest gathering to date since the Vatican followed Italy in locking down in March to prevent virus infections. Over the course of the pandemic, Vietnam emerged slowly but surely as one of countries that handled the outbreak best, especially considering it is bordering China, where the first mass cluster of infections was recorded, and its relatively underdeveloped healthcare system. The CNN reports on how Vietnam has managed to keep Covid-deaths at zero. Israel has seen an uptick in coronavirus cases as it begins lifting restrictions on restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other businesses, Haaretz reports. 25 people tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday, raising the total tally of infections to 17,012, less than 2,000 of them still active. No patients died on Saturday. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the recent spike in confirmed coronavirus cases and said the coming days would be \u201ca test\u201d, adding that the government will take steps to counter the spread of the virus, including increased enforcement of the coronavirus regulations and support for businesses that keep with regulations. 284 people have died in total in Israel from Covid-19. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, 554 people tested positive, and two people have died. In the Gaza Strip, 61 people were diagnosed, 18 of whom recovered, and one person has died. Although outdoor gatherings in groups larger than two isn\u2019t permitted in England until Monday, from when people can meet outdoors in groups of up to six, large crowds flocked to beaches and parks on the weekend. Here a picture of a crowded beach on Saturday at Durdle Door, a famous beauty spot on England\u2019s Jurassic Coast. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Poland increased by 416 since Friday evening and reached 23,571, the Ministry of Health said on Saturday. Ten additional deaths were reported since Friday. Out of 221 new infection cases reported by Saturday morning, 178 were identified in the Silesia mining region in southern Poland, which so far has showed the highest number of coronavirus infections as coal companies are still receiving the results of large-scale coronavirus tests conducted on mine workers. So far, 1,061 people have died from from Covid-19 in the country. Coronavirus infections in France are continuing to decline, health officials said on Saturday, with 14,380 patients currently in hospital, down from 14,695 a day earlier. The number of serious coronavirus cases in intensive care in the country has fallen to 1,325 from 1,361. The hospital death toll from the virus rose by 57 to 18,444 - the 10th consecutive daily increase below 100. Numbers for nursing home deaths will next be updated on 2 June, the directorate said. New York\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill on Saturday that will grant death benefits to the families of police officers, public health workers and other front-line workers who have died of the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation at his daily briefing on the virus. The bill passed by state lawmakers this past week provides a death benefit that is more substantial than the regular death benefit that public workers families receive. Dozens of police officers, public health workers, transit workers and paramedics have died of Covid-19 in the months since New York became the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. Cuomo said 67 people died of Covid-19 in the state on Friday, the same number as Thursday and a steep drop from the height of New York\u2019s outbreak in April when more than 700 people were dying of the virus daily. Speaking in the Bronx, Cuomo said he will focus this week on providing more testing for the coronavirus and more supplies like masks to neighborhoods in the outer boroughs of New York City where infection rates remain stubbornly high. New York City is expected to enter the first phase of loosening coronavirus restrictions on 8 June. England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam has taken position against the behaviour of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s top aide Dominic Cummings, who defied the government\u2019s lockdown rules and undertook several long road trips, causing a public outcry. Asked whether people in authority should obey the rules imposed in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic, Van-Tam said on Saturday: \u201cIn my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. And in my opinion they apply to all.\u201d The prime minister had previously backed his top advisor and said Cummings had acted \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d, although police said he had probably breached the rules. Thousands of workers rallied Saturday outside the Renault factory in northern France to protest the automaker\u2019s decision to cut 15,000 jobs worldwide, including 4,600 in France, Agence France-Presse reports. Unions said 8,000 people took part in the protest at the Maubeuge subsidiary over the cuts designed to help Renault steer out of a cash crunch exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The plant, which employs around 2,100 people, has been stopped since Friday. Under the new plan, Maubeuge-based production of electric Kangoo utility vehicles is set to move to Douai, 70 kilometres (45 miles) away, much to the consternation of workers. \u201cIt\u2019s an earthquake that is taking place. We want to keep our company here,\u201d Jerome Delvaux, a union member, said. \u201cThis demonstration today is very important, even if it is a first step, to show the government and Renault that workers and residents of this area are committed to this company and that we have support,\u201d Delvaux added. \u201cWe need these jobs, otherwise it\u2019s a whole territory that will die,\u201d he said. The company will target savings of more than two billion euros ($2.2 billion) over three years and turn its focus to electric vehicles as it seeks to restore competitiveness in a market reeling from slumping sales since the Covid-19 pandemic forced millions of people into home confinement for weeks on end. Pakistan has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March, the health ministry said. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days, and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days. On Saturday, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reached 66,457, with 2,429 new cases detected in the past 24 hours. The number of total deaths from the virus has climbed to 1,396. According to the health ministry statistics, the southern Sindh province tops the tally with 26,113 cases, followed by the northeastern Punjab province, where 24,104 people have so far been infected with the virus. Sri Lankan authorities fear a fresh outbreak of coronavirus infections after thousands of mourners paid their respects to the body of a respected union leader on Saturday, defying a curfew and social distancing rule, Agence France-Presse reports. Large crowds were seen jostling to bid farewell to Arumugam Thondaman, the leader of a tea plantation union and a government minister. The 55-year-old died of a heart attack on Tuesday and is due to be cremated Sunday at Nuwara Eliya, in the country\u2019s tea-growing highlands. Authorities had imposed a 24-hour curfew in an unsuccessful attempt to stop crowds from visiting Thondaman\u2019s body. \u201cCrowd control has been difficult. Distraught supporters have tried to push down police barriers to get into a building and pay their respects,\u201d a police officer in the area said. Large crowds had also gathered at the office of his Ceylon Worker\u2019s Congress party in Colombo to view his body before the funeral procession went east for final rites. A statement by a group of government doctors warned the funeral \u201ccould undermine public confidence in measures taken so far to contain the spread of the virus and lead to a second wave.\u201d The doctors expressed \u201cdispleasure\u201d over the public farewell for Thondaman at a time when health authorities had asked people to restrict funeral attendees to close family members. Sri Lanka has reported 10 deaths and 1,559 infections since the island country identified its first COVID-19 patient in January. Colombia issued new measures to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital Bogota, as the rest of the country prepares for quarantine rules to start lifting, Reuters reports. The country has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths. Colombia began a nationwide quarantine in late March to control the spread of Covid-19. On Thursday, the government extended the lockdown until 1 July, but eased some restrictions. All of Colombia will be required to observe current measures until Sunday, as thousands of businesses are gradually re-opening with safety protocols and reduced staff. However, Bogota and the cities of Cali and Cartagena, which have been hit hard by the pandemic, will not see rules relaxed, the government said in a statement. Bogota has reported more than 9,000 of Colombia\u2019s coronavirus cases and 239 deaths. Cali and Cartagena have reported over 2,400 and more than 2,600 cases, respectively, and 105 and 126 deaths. The cities must follow current quarantine measures and will perform close monitoring and screening until 15 June, the government said. Latin America\u2019s fourth-largest economy has been battered by the double shock of measures to slow the virus and a slump in oil prices. Under the eased restrictions, children aged two to five will be allowed outside for 30 minutes three times a week, as will adults over 70 years of age. Those from six to 17-years old will be permitted outside for up to an hour three times a week, while adults under 70 will be allowed outside for two hours each day. Italy\u2019s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 232,664 on Saturday, as daily new infections fell to 416, down from 516 on Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said. The country\u2019s overall Covid-19 death toll rose by 111 to 33,340, a slight increase from the 87 deaths reported in the 24 hours to Friday. On Thursday, 70 deaths were reported. Italy has the third highest death toll in the world after those of the United States and Britain, with Lombardy, Piedmont, Emiglia Romana and Veneto in the north of the country the worst affected regions. Britain is at a very dangerous moment as it starts to ease some of its lockdown measures, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer said on Saturday, warning that people would need to follow the guidelines and not \u201ctear the pants out of it\u201d. Jonathan Van-Tam joined other scientific advisors to the government in warning against the decision to ease England\u2019s lockdown. Van-Tam told the government\u2019s daily briefing that people have got to be \u201csensible and proportionate with the freedom that we absolutely want to give to people because we need to see loved ones\u201d. He said the public needed \u201cto actually follow the guidance, don\u2019t tear the pants out of it, and don\u2019t go further than the guidance actually says\u201d. Britain\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, also called Sage, was very clear that the easing of lockdown has to go painstakingly slowly, he said, adding that scientists would continue to unapologetically give that advice to the government. India extended its coronavirus lockdown until 30 June in high-risk zones but permitted restaurants, malls and religious buildings to reopen elsewhere from 8 June, despite a record high number of cases detected nationwide on Saturday, Reuters reports. The home ministry ordered state governments and local authorities to identify \u201ccontainment zones\u201d, or areas that should remain under lockdown, as they continue to report high number of infections. Hospitality and retail sectors, as well as places of worship, are allowed to open from 8 June, while the government expects local authorities to ensure physical distancing rules and staggered business hours. India reported a record daily jump of 7,964 new Covid-19 infections on Saturday and has so far recorded 173,763 positive cases and 4,971 deaths, making the world\u2019s second-most populous country ninth on the list of most infections. Restrictions on international air travel and city train services remain in place, but permission for intra-state travel was granted. Individual states are expected to make a call on the reopening of schools and colleges in July. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is due to address the nation on Sunday as his government struggles to get the outbreak under control despite imposing the world\u2019s longest lockdown. Thousands of people across the US joined protests on Friday and Saturday over the killing of George Floyd. The writer and academic Louis Fishman captured some scenes of a demonstration on Friday in Brooklyn, New York, with many protesters wearing masks to protect themselves and others in the crowd from coronavirus. US president Donald Trump has threatened protesters joining rallies across the country with corporal punishment and violence. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump praised the US secret service, mocked protesters and rejected their calls for justice for Floyd, who died after a police officer had knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was pleading for help. In a seperate tweet, Trump claimed that protesters attending various rallies were \u201cOrganized Groups\u201d that \u201chave nothing to do with George Floyd.\u201d Spain\u2019s official coronavirus infections rose by 271 to 239,228 on Saturday, the health ministry said, while reporting four further deaths, a dramatic decline in daily fatalities in recent weeks as the country brings the outbreak under control, Reuters reports. Spain was at one point one of the worst affected countries by the pandemic but it has now has started to ease lockdown restrictions. However, with people relaxing after months shut up inside, police have intervened in a series of incidents at parties, funerals and other social gatherings at which restrictions were broken. In Barcelona, bathers were moved off the beach after some were spotted breaching rules by swimming in the Mediterranean, police said on Saturday. The government said meanwhile that four small islands will be able to open the outside terraces of bars and restaurants to 75% of their capacity from Monday, a further easing of rules for parts of the country least affected by the disease. Tables on terraces must still be kept 1.5 metres (5 feet) apart, according to regulations published by the Official Bulletin and affecting La Graciosa, El Hierro and La Gomera in the Canary Islands, and Formentera in the Balearics. In the four islands entering phase 3, groups of up to 20 people can meet and shopping centres will be allowed to re-open at 40% of capacity. Hotels and other leisure establishments can have common areas up to 50% of capacity. Companies should still encourage home working but also can organise the return of workers to the office as long as their arrival is staggered. Museums will be allowed to organise activities. The country\u2019s total death toll now stands at 27,125. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 deaths peaked in week 14, where twice as many people died compared to an average week. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Aamna Mohdin. Please feel free to share updates and flag anything you think I might have missed. You can either email me or message me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @JedySays. That\u2019s it from me. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my collegue Jedidajah Otte. Austria\u2019s government has approved hosting Formula 1\u2019s season-opening races on 5 July, according to Reuters. The races will take place behind closed doors. The UK government is being urged to \u201cstep back\u201d and stop the planned reopening of schools in England from Monday following concerns from experts about the easing of lockdown. Four prominent members of the government\u2019s own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have broken ranks to express worries about the safety of wider primary school openings on Monday. In a statement issued on Saturday afternoon, the National Education Union (NEU) said the comments from expert advisers undermine the government\u2019s claim that it is following the science. The union said the contact-tracing system must be running successfully before the risk level that comes with children and teachers returning to school can be mitigated. Parisians flocked to sunny parks and gardens as they reopened in the French capital on Saturday for the first time after almost 11 weeks of coronavirus lockdown. \u201cAt last we\u2019re free,\u201d Anne told Reuters. \u201cThis feels like being released from a kind of prison.\u201d Thousands of Bosnians took to the streets on Saturday to protest against bad governance, nationalism and corruption as senior officials face public anger over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Reuters reports that the government is under fire for the procurement of defective ventilators for Covid-19 patients. The protest was organised by a small moderate party, the Platform for Progress, and joined by leaders of other opposition groups. \u201cWhat we are hoping to do is to wake the people up so that they know it is up to them, that they can actually bring about change,\u201d party leader, Mirsad Hadzikadic, told Reuters. \u201cI am fed up with everything, with all this rhetoric and nationalism,\u201d said fashion designer Jasna Hadzimehmedovic-Bekric. \u201cThis is all nonsense, covering up for big thefts that have been going on for the past 30 years and we are silent.\u201d The European Union urged Donald Trump to rethink his decision to cut American funding for the World Health Organization, AP reports. The US president on Friday claimed WHO didn\u2019t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused it of being under Chinese control. The US is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organisation. Trump said it would be redirecting the money to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs, without providing specifics. On Saturday, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to reconsider, saying that actions that weaken international results must be avoided and that now is the time for enhanced cooperation and common solutions. Earlier today, the South African health minister, Zweli Mkhize, called Trump\u2019s announcement an unfortunate turn of events. \u201cCertainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused ... on one common enemy,\u201d he said. The government is facing increasing pressure from its scientific advisers over the decision to ease England\u2019s lockdown. Prof Peter Horby has become the latest adviser to express his concerns, saying on Saturday that while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with coronavirus, lockdown measures may be being eased too soon. Horby, of the University of Oxford, joined Sir Jeremy Farrar and Prof John Edmunds, all members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), in warning that ministers were taking risks. Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in socially distanced groups of six. \u201cHappy Monday\u201d will also signal the reopening of schools \u2013 allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class \u2013 as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. Horby told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cYou know, we have still got 8,000 cases a day. We have been very successful in bringing it down, decreasing the numbers because of the social distancing.\u201d But he said it was vital \u201cwe don\u2019t lose control again\u201d. A Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine could be ready for market as early as the end of this year, China\u2019s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said in a social media post, according to a report by Reuters. More than 2,000 people have received vaccines developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products during clinical trials. Vaccines from both institutes had entered the second phase of clinical trials. Both groups are affiliated with state-owned pharmaceutical group Sinopharm, whose management is overseen by SASAC. For the first time in years, the few remaining local residents of Budapest\u2019s party district can fall asleep without a nocturnal chorus of drunken stag groups outside their windows. The sweeping expanse of Krak\u00f3w\u2019s central square is no longer teeming with tour groups, and it is possible to traverse Prague\u2019s Charles Bridge without elbowing through hordes of selfie-takers. Coronavirus travel restrictions are proving tough to bear for the hundreds of thousands who work in the region\u2019s hospitality industry, but are also giving the many beautiful cities of central Europe time and space to think about how to deal with their overtourism problems. Budget flights and low prices have been a mixed blessing for these places, as a trickle of tourists turned to a flood in the decades since the Iron Curtain fell. \u201cThe residents have been complaining for a very long time that the city doesn\u2019t belong to them any more,\u201d said Barbora Hrub\u00e1 of Prague City Tourism, a municipal body that works on the Czech capital\u2019s tourism strategy. With 9 million international visitors a year, Prague has become Europe\u2019s fourth most visited city, after Paris, London and Rome. Tourists are not usually interested in seeing the rest of the country, or even much of the city. The average length of stay is just 2.4 days, and the majority of tourists crowd into the city\u2019s old town, which over the years has pushed out much local life from the area. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to rebuild and restart tourism in the city differently. We want a different type of visitor who visits more than the most famous monuments in the centre,\u201d said Hrub\u00e1. Italy will not be treated like a leper colony, the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, said on Saturday, as some European countries seek to keep their borders shut to visitors from places that have been badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. European countries are cautiously reopening their borders next month as the coronavirus contagion subsides around the continent. Italy is set to let tourists back in from 15 June. While Di Maio promised a warm welcome to foreign tourists this summer, some EU states will keep their doors closed to visitors from countries with high coronavirus cases. Greece, for example, said on Friday it would open its frontiers to citizens from just 29 countries, excluding Italians, Spaniards and Britons. \u201cWe do not accept blacklists,\u201d Di Maio wrote on Facebook, announcing a forthcoming round of bilateral meetings both in Rome and abroad to press Italy\u2019s case. \u201cIf anyone thinks they can treat us like a leper colony, then they should know that we will not stand for it.\u201d Italy has the third highest death toll in the world from coronavirus, with some 33,229 people dying during the outbreak. Temperatures in some California cities this week broke decades-old records. The heatwave that cooked Las Vegas over the past few days brought temperatures over 37.8C (100F). And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 43.3C (110F). This year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority, and older populations. Even before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect \u2013 cities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat. Studies have also found that cities\u2019 poorest neighbourhoods tend to be hotter, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighbourhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centres where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19. The Mexican president says the pandemic has been tamed, but experts and those who must bury the dead, fear an alarming rise in cases, according to a worrying report on the coronavirus outbreak in Mexico by Analy Nu\u00f1o in Guadalajara, Madeleine Wattenbarger in Mexico City and Tom Phillips. Rwandan medical workers have deployed robots to minimise contact between patients infected with the coronavirus and doctors and nurses. Reuters reports the country has deployed the three robots to carry out simple tasks such as taking temperatures and monitoring patients. Judges in Milan have placed Uber Italy under special administration for allegedly exploiting its food delivery riders during the coronavirus emergency. Italy\u2019s Guardia di Finanza (Finance Police) are investigating Uber Italy over an alleged gang-mastering case, following an investigation by the Italian national daily newspaper Corriere della Sera. According to judicial sources, reported by Italy\u2019s news agency ANSA, \u201cthe riders are not formally employed by Uber but by two other intermediary firms in the logistics sector including Flash Road City which has been placed under investigation.\u201d One said his pay was always \u20ac3 per delivery no matter what the day or time. Sources reported by Reuters said: \u201cUber Eats is alleged to have paid much higher sums to two recruitment companies that took on and managed the riders, most of them foreigners recruited from migrant reception centres.\u2019\u2019 According to Repubblica, riders were mainly from Mali, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast, Gambia, Guinea, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The company denies exploiting the riders and said it had made its \u201cUber Eats platform available to restaurants and couriers in full respect of the law and it condemned any form of illegal intermediation\u201d. \u201cWe participate actively in the debate around regulation which we believe will give the food delivery sector the necessary legal security to prosper in Italy,\u201d Uber Italy said in an emailed statement reported by Reuters. The Milan court said the firms had hired riders in an \u201cuncontrolled\u201d way during the Covid-19 emergency. India has recorded a total of 173,763 coronavirus cases and 4,971 deaths, making it the ninth most-affected country globally, according to Reuters. While the fatality rates in India have been lower than in worse-hit countries, experts fear the peak has not been reached due to mounting cases of new infections. In an open letter marking one year into his second term, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, appealed to the country\u2019s population of 1.3 billion to follow all lockdown rules to stop the spread of the pandemic. He said there was a \u201clong battle\u201d ahead against coronavirus. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases, with the capital, Kabul, and western Herat province experiencing the worst day of the crisis. The health ministry confirmed 866 new Covid-19 cases across the war-torn country, pushing the total number of infection to 14,525. Three patients died overnight, bringing the death toll to 249. There have been 1,303 recoveries. More than 60% of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive across the country. The health ministry, which tested 1,425 suspected patients, has pledged to increase the number of daily tests. It has so far tested 37,348 patients. In the capital, the health ministry recorded 411 new confirmed cases. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area for number of transmissions, with the total number of infections in the capital at 5,775. Herat, which borders Iran, recorded 177 new cases. The first case of the virus were reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat is 2,461 with 51 deaths. The situation in southern province of Kandahar is also concerning as no one has been tested in more than a fortnight due to problems in the testing process. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister said he instructed the health sector of Kandahar and nearby provinces to send samples to Kabul. \u201cWe have a serious problem in Kandahar, PCR machine is off and there is no flight toward Kandahar so our engineers fix that, there will be a UN flight to Kandahar in coming days and our team will go with that,\u201d Majroh said this week. Majroh said 40% of total confirmed cases were recorded in the 10 days before Eid and added that previously he was \u201cwarning that the flood [of coronavirus] will come, but now the flood has arrived and many people are sinking\u201d. Everywhere in the country, the eastern province of Nangarhar and the northern province of Balkh saw a surge in the number of new infections recorded with 74 new cases combined. Indonesia reported 557 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, Reuters reports. The figure takes the south-east Asian nation\u2019s tally to 25,773, health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said. Yurianto reported 53 new deaths, taking the toll to 1,573, while 7,015 people have recovered. It\u2019s not the carefree city Celia Topping is accustomed to, but as more restrictions are lifted in Berlin, she writes a dispatch on the happy unmasked faces as campsites, lidos and lakes reopen for the summer. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will not attend an in-person meeting in the US with the leaders of the world\u2019s major economies if president Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said on Saturday. AP reports that after cancelling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10 to 12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a great sign to all of things returning to normal during the pandemic. Merkel initially suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office later told the dpa news agency she could not commit to participating in person. President Hassan Rouhani said mosques are to resume daily prayers throughout the country, despite some areas seeing high levels of coronavirus infections. Rouhani said on state television that the hours of shopping malls, which had been allowed to open only until 6pm, will be extended, as part of the government\u2019s plans to ease coronavirus restrictions, Reuters reports. He added that physical distancing and other health protocols would be observed in mosques. He did not say when they were due to reopen. As lockdown is relaxed in the UK, many in the NHS are left reeling. Palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke shares her experience working with coronavirus patients, and her fears of a second wave Pollution from human and agriculture waste spilling into the seas off Rome has decreased 30% during Italy\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, according to an AP report on preliminary results from a nationwide survey of seawater quality. Authorities said it was too soon to give the lockdown sole credit for the change, saying that shifting sea currents and limited rainfall in April and May also could have been responsible for reduced runoff of livestock and fertiliser waste. Marco Lupo, the director general of the Lazio regions environmental agency, said the reduction in tourism from March could have reduced the amount of sewage produced by the 30 million tourists who normally visit Rome each year. Russia reports 8,952 new coronavirus cases and 181 deaths in past 24 hours, Reuters reports. The new daily figures are down from the record 232 deaths registered the previous day and pushes the nationwide death toll to 4,555. Officials said 8,952 new infections had been confirmed, bringing the national tally to 396,575, the third highest reported total in the world after the US and Brazil. Hello, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog for the rest of the day. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham joins a chorus of voices warning that lockdown restrictions are being eased too soon in England. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think we have arrived at quite a dangerous moment. This is premature, this easing of the lockdown. Test and trace is not fully operational and it should be, in my view, before these steps are taken. Referring to the coronavirus infection rate, Burnham said: \u201cThe R number ... is still quite high. It follows comments from one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers, who voiced unease over the decision to lift England\u2019s lockdown while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with the coronavirus. He warned that loosening restrictions could easily lead to a second wave. I\u2019m going to hand you over to Aamna Mohdin now. But first, news that Saudi Arabia\u2019s golf courses are going to reopen on Sunday. The Saudi Golf Federation has released a raft of measures. Players at the kingdom\u2019s domestic courses will have to carry their own bags from their cars. In the bunker? \u201cGolfers will be asked to smooth the sand using their club or feet, rather than use a rake.\u201d On the green? \u201cIt will be forbidden for players to touch or handle the flagstick. Putts will need to be completed with the flagstick in, with players removing their own balls from the hole.\u201d Taiwan has approved the use of the potential Covid-19 treatment remdesivir \u2013 the same drug approved for an experimental trial by UK authorities earlier this week. The drug is produced by California-based Gilead Sciences. Reuters reports: Taiwan\u2019s Central Epidemic Command Centre said the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration took into account \u201cthe fact that the efficacy and safety of remdesivir has been supported by preliminary evidence\u201d and its use is being approved by other countries. On that basis, the centre said the conditions had been met for approval of the drug for use in patients with \u201csevere\u201d Covid-19 infection. Gilead has said it will donate 1.5m doses of remdesivir, enough to treat at least 140,000 patients, to combat the global pandemic. Taiwan has been successful at preventing the coronavirus from spreading, thanks to early detection and prevention work and a first-rate public health system. It has recorded 442 cases and only seven deaths. The vast majority of people have recovered, with just 14 active cases. There is currently no approved medication or vaccine for Covid-19, but EU countries are already administering remdesivir to patients under compassionate use rules. Japan and the United Kingdom have both cleared the drug for use and moved to begin supplying it to patients. The United States, the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical market, this month granted emergency use authorisation for remdesivir in Covid-19, but has yet to approve the broader use of the drug. Reuters reports on developments in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan has extended measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus until 15 June, but relaxed some restrictions, allowing the resumption of domestic tourism and soccer games, the authorities said on Saturday. The country had locked down all its provinces and closed all non-essential businesses in March. The Tashkent government eased some restrictions this month, dividing the country into \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cred\u201d zones on the basis of the rates of newly-detected infections. The new measures allow many businesses to reopen from 1 June, depending on the zones they fall in, for example, in \u201cgreen\u201d zones, children\u2019s summer camps, recreational and sports centres will start working and people will be allowed to hold weddings and other traditional ceremonies with up to 30 guests. Central Asia\u2019s most populous nation of 34 million, which resumed domestic air flights and train services this month, said the domestic football league would resume, without spectators, from 5 June. Bus tours between provinces will also resume, with halts barred in \u201cred\u201d zones, the cabinet said. It announced a plan this week to subsidise the tourism sector, with measures such as paying tour operators and agents $15 for every tourist brought in from abroad, but it remains unclear when the borders will reopen for foreigners. AFP reports on some worrying sentiments against Singapore\u2019s 90 or so otters, who are evidently unhindered by the city\u2019s lockdown conditions. They\u2019ve featured in nature documentaries, including the Nature\u2019s New Wild shown on the BBC. From AFP. Singapore\u2019s otters, long adored by the city-state\u2019s nature lovers, are popping up in unexpected places during the coronavirus lockdown but their antics have angered some and even sparked calls for a cull. With the streets empty, the creatures have been spotted hanging out by a shopping centre, scampering through the lobby of a hospital and even feasting on pricey fish stolen from a pond. While many think of tiny Singapore as a densely populated concrete jungle, it is also relatively green for a busy Asian city, and has patches of rainforest, fairly clean waterways and abundant wildlife. There are estimated to be about 90 otters in Singapore, making up 10 families, and appearances at popular tourist sites around the city-state\u2019s downtown waterfront have transformed them into local celebrities. They featured in a documentary narrated by David Attenborough, are tracked avidly by the local media \u2013 and have been spotted more frequently since people were asked to stay home and workplaces closed in April to fight the virus. Graham Readfearn here taking over from Calla Wahlquist for our global coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reuters reports that 12 migrants have tested positive for Covid-19 at a government-run shelter in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez. Mexico\u2019s labor ministry said on Friday that the gritty industrial city of Ciudad Juarez, neighbouring El Paso, Texas, had received thousands of migrants under a Trump administration policy that sends US asylum seekers to Mexico to await the outcomes of their cases. The migrants who have tested positive in the Leona Vicario centre, which houses 337 people, have been isolated. \u201cPeople with Covid-19 symptoms receive medical treatment in a timely manner and remain in an isolation area to monitor their progress.\u201d The infected migrants are from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, the director of the centre, Ivan Jimenez, said. Fourteen migrants considered to be high-risk, including pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions, were transferred to another facility. Migrants in the shelter, one of Mexico\u2019s largest along the border, have been in isolation for more than two months, Jimenez said. Many had found work in Ciudad Juarez but had been forced to give it up amid the pandemic. The centre has supplied children with educational materials and hopes to resume more activities as cases among the migrants dwindle, Jimenez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really horrible for people,\u201d he said. \u201cAbove all, our concern is for mental health.\u201d I am going to hand over to Graham Readfearn. Stay well and stay safe, especially if you\u2019re at protests in the US right now. The Australian Veterinary Association has written to the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, seeking assurance that he will uphold new Australian regulations banning the live export of sheep to the Middle East during the northern hemisphere summer. The export ban comes into effect on Monday, 1 June. The association\u2019s president, Dr Warwick Vale, said he had become aware that the Al-Kuwait was seeking an exemption to sail after the cutoff after being delayed by a coronavirus outbreak among its crew. The ship arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 22 May and was scheduled to leave with 56,000 sheep on board before the cutoff. Animal welfare groups have also argued that the exporter should not be granted an exemption. Vale said the \u201cwelfare risks to the animals are unacceptably high in June, and that no exemptions should be granted\u201d. It is critical that the government upholds the regulations to ensure that animal welfare standards during live export of sheep are in line with the expectations of the veterinary profession and the wider community. The US supreme court has rejected a challenge by a church groups to block California\u2019s lockdown laws, which limit attendance at religious worship to 25% of building capacity or 100 people. More from Reuters: In the California dispute, the nine justices split 5-4 in rejecting a bid by South Bay United Pentecostal church in Chula Vista to block the rules issued by governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat. Conservative chief justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberal justices in the majority. Newsom ordered houses of worship closed to the public in March, but issued guidelines this week limiting attendance to 25% of building capacity or 100 people, whichever was lower. \u201cThe precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement,\u201d Roberts wrote. There were no noted dissents as the court rejected a similar request by two churches in Illinois, seeking exemption from Democratic governor JB Pritzker\u2019s ban on services of more than 10 people, arguing that it infringed on the constitutionally protected free exercise of religion. In a brief statement, the court said the state public health department had removed those limits on Thursday. Here is the letter sent by NSW Health. Passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, a voyage which was responsible for 10% of all coronavirus cases in Australia after an outbreak on board, have been issued with yet another health warning \u2013 this time for tuberculosis. The ABC reported that a person who had been a crew member on the ship was diagnosed with TB this week and is being treated in the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Sydney. NSW Health has issued warnings to some people who may be at risk of infection, including hospital staff, roommates, close friends and workmates, but said that passengers are at a very low risk of infection. Germany has recorded 738 new cases of coronavirus on Friday, bringing its national total to 181,196, data from the Robert Koch institute for infectious diseases showed. The reported death toll rose by 39 to 8,489. In Seoul worshippers have donned face masks to celebrate Buddha\u2019s birthday which was delayed from 30 April to 30 May due to the coronavirus outbreak. A leading evolutionary biologist, Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, has just emailed with a reaction to a new study in the journal Science Advances looking at the origins of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. The first post on that is here. Holmes is one of the scientists to have carried out detailed work mapping the virus\u2019s genome, and he suggests there\u2019s plenty more work to be done. He said: This paper provides no new data and tells us nothing new about the origin of Sars-Cov-2. There is a clear evolutionary gap between Sars-Cov-2 and its closest relatives found to date in bat and pangolins. The only way this gap will be filled is through more wildlife sampling. As mentioned earlier, we have rolling coverage of the protests in the US in response to the police killing of George Floyd. I\u2019m not touching it. Worth noting that the anti-vax, anti-5G and kind of anti-lockdown protests in Australia today are able to go ahead with less police intervention because all states have loosened social distancing restrictions because Australia\u2019s management of the Covid-19 has been largely successful. For example, Queensland has reported no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, and says 4,119 tests were conducted in the same period. The state has six active cases. NSW also reported no new cases today. Nationally there were just 24 new cases yesterday. Let\u2019s check back in with the anti-vax, anti-5G protests in Australia today. Several hundred people marched in Sydney. I\u2019m slightly confused by some of these signs. There was also a large protest in Brisbane. The protest in Melbourne is a fair bit smaller. Senior conservative MPs in the UK are reportedly urging Boris Johnson to change the two-metre social distancing rule to 1.5m on the grounds that it could prevent large-scale redundancies, AP has reported. More from AP: While the prime minister spoke this week in favour of the two-metre gap, The Daily Telegraph said concerns are building that thousands of hospitality industry workers who have so far been unable to return to work could be laid off unless the rule is relaxed immediately. Greg Clark, chairman of the Commons science committee and the former business secretary, has reportedly written to Johnson urging him to relax the rule. \u201cThe difference between two metres and 1.5 metres may seem small but it can be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs,\u201d Clark told the paper. A former Brexit secretary, David Davis, said alterations to the government-backed furlough scheme should be implemented \u201cin step\u201d with a relaxation of the two-metre rule. He said some firms would be unfairly disadvantaged if they had to remain shut due to the two-metre rule while being forced to start paying towards staff costs again under changes to the furlough plan. \u201cWhat will happen is that they will shut, meaning the furlough money is wasted, and there will be no tax revenue from that business,\u201d Davis was quoted as saying. The Telegraph said Clark cited a new paper from the scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage) which says it may be possible to \u201cenable distancing at less than two metres\u201d in certain areas, provided other Covid-19 control measures are implemented. The director of the Venice film festival, Alberto Barbera, has provided an update on the festival, which will be held despite Italy being one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, with more than 33,000 deaths. Barbera said on Instagram that the 77th edition of the festival will go ahead from 2-22 September. Organisers are betting on a \u201creturn to normality\u201d in Venice by the end of summer, AFP reported. Barbera said: It will be a unique edition. We still don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019ll be able to do, but in the meantime are selecting the films and drawing up a plan to allow everyone to participate safely. The Cannes film festival, scheduled for July, is not going ahead \u201cin its original form\u201d. More from AFP: Thierry Fremaux, the Cannes festival\u2019s director, has said he and Barbera have discussed the possibility of some type of collaboration, without providing details. One complication for Venice, which has not yet released its roster of films, is that Cannes is set to unveil its selection on Wednesday. The 50 to 60 films on the list will not be shown on the Croisette, but will benefit from the \u201cCannes 2020\u201d label created after the cancellation of the 73rd edition. Whether some of those films show at Venice instead, or bypass the Mostra entirely to premiere at other festivals such as Toronto or San Sebastian, remains unclear. But Giona Nazzaro, a programmer who has helped revitalise Film Critics\u2019 Week, a Venice sidebar show, told the Manifesto newspaper that the festival going ahead provided a much-needed glimmer of light in dark times. \u201cThat an industry suffering like the film industry is starting up again is a sign of hope,\u201d he said. The Australian opposition party says it is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by US president Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cut ties between Washington and the World Health Organisation. In a joint statement, Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, and health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said: Labor is deeply disappointed by the United States government\u2019s decision to terminate its relationship with the WHO. As we have previously acknowledged, there is considerable room for improvement at the WHO, but that improvement will not happen by walking away or asking it to do more with less. The Australian government should urge the US to reconsider its decision and work with other member states to ensure adequate funding of the WHO to continue to perform its important role. They added: It\u2019s just 12 days since the US president wrote to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus giving the WHO 30 days to commit to substantive improvements. And it\u2019s just 11 days since the unanimous vote at the World Health Assembly to establish an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19. Now, more than ever, the world needs a strong, effective and well-resourced WHO ... perceptions of national influence over international organisations diminish the standing and capacity of those organisations \u2013 to everyone\u2019s detriment. The T20 cricket World Cup in Australia is likely to be postponed, but Scott Heinrich writes that doing so may help clear the way for the lucrative Indian Premier League. He writes: And so it has come to pass: Cricket Australia this week announced dates for an India tour that will encompass four Tests, three T20s and ODIs, and three one-dayers for the women\u2019s teams. They might be the fiercest of rivals on the field, but off it Australia and India can be the snuggest of bedfellows when it suits them. Should anyone have forgotten who possesses the whip hand in world cricket, wonder no more. This is a pangolin, if you are not familiar with them: The search for the source of the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic continues. A new study suggests a virus carried by bats gained its ability to bind to human cells from another animal, possibly a pangolin. Scientists in the journal Science Advances found the closest relative of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was circulating in bats. But that virus lacked the protein that would have allowed it to bind to human cells. The scientists found this ability could have been acquired from a virus found in pangolins \u2013 a scaly mammal that\u2019s one of the most illegally trafficked animals on the planet. Researchers from Duke University, Los Alamos national laboratory, the University of Texas at El Paso and New York University carried out the genetic analysis. Dr Elena Giorgi, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, of Los Alamos national laboratory, said: People had already looked at the coronavirus sequences sampled from pangolins that we discuss in our paper, however, the scientific community was still divided on whether they played a role in the evolution of Sars-Cov-2. In our study, we demonstrated that indeed Sars-Cov-2 has a rich evolutionary history that included a reshuffling of genetic material between bat and pangolin coronavirus before it acquired its ability to jump to humans. The study still doesn\u2019t confirm the pangolin as the animal that passed the virus to humans, but it adds weight to previous studies that have suggested it may have been involved. In the study, the authors say the \u201cclose proximity of animals of different species in a wet market setting may increase the potential for cross-species spillover infections\u201d because it allowed viruses to mix and recombine. They add: While the direct reservoir of Sars-Cov-2 is still being sought, one thing is clear: reducing or eliminating direct human contact with wild animals is critical to preventing new coronavirus zoonosis in the future. Back to Australia now where protesters have gathered in Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park. The target of their protests is a confusing mess of vaccines, 5G and other conspiracy theories ossified around the rallying point of coronavirus lockdowns. Speakers include far-right anti-vaccine YouTubers arguing against childhood vaccine. According to the journalist Cameron Wilson, one speaker asked the crowd to raise their hands if they have died from the flu shot. Fairly remarkable if he got a response to that one. Wilson says there are several hundred people there. It seems roughly similar in theme if not yet in vibe to a protest in Melbourne earlier this month, at which a number of people were arrested for breaching lockdown restrictions and assaulting a police officer. From AFP: Germany and the European Commission have reached agreement on a giant Berlin-funded rescue plan for coronavirus-hit airline Lufthansa, a commission spokeswoman and a source close to the negotiations said on Friday. Since the pandemic hit Europe, the Lufthansa group \u2013 which also includes Brussels and Austrian Airlines and Swiss \u2013 has been bleeding 1m euros an hour, with about 90% of its 760-aircraft fleet grounded. The deal would see the German carrier give up eight planes and their associated landing rights. Lufthansa said it had \u201cdecided to accept the commitments offered by Germany to the EU commission\u201d for the rescue package, adding it would surrender up to 24 take-off and landing slots that could be allocated to rival airlines. German media had previously reported the European Commission would demand the group give up valuable take-off and landing rights at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs in exchange for Brussels\u2019 green light. The 9bn-euro ($10bn) German state lifeline would see Berlin take a 20% stake in the group, with an option to claim a further 5% plus one share to block hostile takeovers. That would make the federal government Lufthansa\u2019s biggest shareholder. On top of a total 5.7bn euros in extra capital and 300m to buy the shares at face value, public investment bank KfW would also lend Lufthansa 3bn euros. The company would agree to pay back much of the capital plus interest while granting the state two seats on its supervisory board. Hammering out the details of the package took so long because the chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives were keen to minimise state control over the company\u2019s day-to-day running. In the United States the president, Donald Trump, has clashed with the governor or North Carolina, Democrat Roy Cooper, over Trump\u2019s insistence that the crowd during his renomination address at the Republican national convention in Charlotte not show visible signs of coronavirus restrictions. The convention is set to begin on 24 August and Trump\u2019s nomination speech is slated for 27 August. In a phone call between Trump and Cooper on Friday, AP reported, Trump \u201cinsisted on a full convention arena with no face coverings and no social distancing\u201d. Cooper \u201cexpressed concerns and suggested a scaled-back event with fewer attendees\u201d. Trump earlier threatened to move the event if he cannot be guaranteed a large crowd. More from AP: The conversation came hours after Cooper\u2019s health secretary, Mandy Cohen, called for more specifics beyond the safety protocols that the GOP convention\u2019s leaders sent her in a letter on Thursday. Cooper\u2019s administration has wanted more planning about public health and safety given the uncertainty Covid-19 has caused regarding commerce and movement restrictions. Cohen wrote to the Republican national committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, and the convention\u2019s chief executive, Marcia Lee Kelly, asking them to confirm whether Trump wanted the convention\u2019s final night to have people together in a crowd-like setting and without social distancing or face masks. Cohen also wanted numbers on how many people would be inside the Spectrum Center nightly, and how social distancing would occur. Kelly and McDaniel wrote back that they needed further direction and assurances from him by next Wednesday to plan for a convention they said would bring a massive economic boost to the city. The Republican national committee declined to comment Friday night. In sport news, the Australian Moto GP on Philip Island has been cancelled. The event was scheduled for 23-35 October. It will be the first time the race has not been run on Philip Island since 1997. Refunds will be offered. The chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation Chairman, Paul Little, said: We\u2019re very disappointed that MotoGP fans throughout Victoria, Australia and internationally won\u2019t get the chance to make the pilgrimage to see the world\u2019s best riders compete on one of the best circuits anywhere in the world, but the right decision has been made. The Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix puts Phillip Island on the global stage and it\u2019ll be back better than ever in 2021. It follows the cancellation in early March of the Formula One Australian Grand Prix, which was the first major event in Australia to be cancelled over coronavirus fears. Australian experts have joined their counterparts in the UK and around the world in voicing their support for the World Health Organisation after the US president, Donald Trump, said Washington would sever ties with the global body. Prof Peter Doherty, a Nobel laureate and patron of the Doherty Institute, which is part of global efforts to find a Covid-19 vaccine, said the WHO had the \u201cfull support of the scientific community\u201d. Earlier Dr Stephen Griffin, an associate professor in the school of medicine at the University of Leeds, said: There is no logic to the move by president Trump to sever links with the WHO. Pandemics are, by definition, a global crisis. To not face Covid-19 with a united front seems futile. Given the scale of the outbreak in the US, this action appears nothing short of an attempt to refocus attention away from how this has been handled. New South Wales has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 overnight. The state still has 71 active cases. The NSW health department says 9,452 tests were carried out yesterday, bringing the total number of tests conducted in that state since the outbreak began to 494,000. Mexico recorded 3,227 new cases of the coronavirus on Friday and 371 more deaths, bringing the total numbers to 84,627 cases and 9,415 fatalities, Reuters reports. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, says the Keilor Downs outbreak is linked back to one family. He said the year 2 student who attended the Holy Eucharist primary school in St Albans South was at school but not displaying any signs of illness on Tuesday. They were tested on Thursday due to close contact with another known case. Sutton said the health department was working with the education department to identify and trace close contacts, and that the affected classrooms and common areas of the school would be deep cleaned. Primary school students in Melbourne, Victoria, have been placed into home quarantine after one member of the year 2 class at the Holy Eucharist primary school in St Auburns tested positive to Covid-19, the ABC reported. Other students from that class have been asked to quarantine. The infection was linked to the previously reported outbreak at Keilor Downs secondary college. Victoria recorded 11 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, three of which were linked to the Keilor Downs cluster and four to the outbreak at the Rydges hotel on Swanston Street in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, where international travellers have been undergoing a mandatory 14-day quarantine. That brings the total number of staff at the Rydges who have tested positive to six after the first two security guards tested positive on Wednesday. Thirteen people in international quarantine at the hotel have also tested positive. We are covering the protests following the death of George Floyd here. Scientists are sifting through the sewage of a town in central Queensland to try to find the source of a Covid-19 infection that led to the death of 30-year-old Nathan Turner, the youngest person in Australia to die after contracting the virus. Queensland recorded no new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and has just six cases lifted as active. The source of the infection that killed Turner remains a mystery. According to AAP: Testing the sewage could also reveal how many people in Blackwater may have been exposed or unknowingly have the virus if traces are detected in the waste. Meanwhile investigators are working to \u201cuntangle\u201d the changing story of a nurse at the centre of two coronavirus scares in Queensland to determine if she could be the source. The unnamed nurse has been suspended after she continued to show up for work at a Rockhampton nursing home despite having symptoms and while waiting on test results. Questions are also being asked about a sightseeing road trip she took to Blackwater during the lockdown. Queensland\u2019s deputy premier and health minister, Steven Miles, says a formal investigation would get to the bottom of critical questions, such as why the nurse didn\u2019t reveal she had travelled to Kuala Lumpur in March. \u201cIt appears to be incredibly unlikely that somebody wasn\u2019t asked if they had travelled overseas when that is such a focus of our investigation efforts for all coronavirus cases,\u201d he said on Friday. He urged all Queenslanders to be honest and truthful if they are contacted by health officials. \u201cLives are literally at risk \u2013 our public health officials are doing their best to keep Queenslanders safe,\u201d he said. In the United States, pool parties over Memorial Day weekend may have caused further outbreaks. This from Associated Press: Health officials said on Friday they wanted to inform mass numbers of unknown people after a person who attended crowded pool parties over the Memorial Day weekend at Missouri\u2019s Lake of the Ozarks tested positive for Covid-19. Camden County health department said the resident of Boone County, in mid-Missouri, tested positive on Sunday after arriving at the lake area a day earlier. Officials said there have been no reported cases of the virus linked to coronavirus in Camden County, where the parties seen in videos and photos posted on social media took place. Because mass numbers of unknown people need to be notified, the officials released a brief timeline of the person\u2019s whereabouts last weekend, including stops at a bar called Backwater Jacks, a bar and restaurant that has a pool, as well as a dining and pool venue called Shady Gators and Lazy Gators. Backwater Jacks owner, Gary Prewitt, said previously in a statement that no laws were broken, although the images appeared to show people violating the Republican governor Mike Parsons\u2019 state order requiring social distancing. Parson allowed businesses and attractions to reopen on 4 May, but the state order requires two metres (six feet) of social distancing to at least the end of May. Animal welfare groups say an Australian live sheep exporter should not be granted an exemption to allow it to ship sheep to the Middle East during the summer ban after crew members on its live export ship tested positive to Covid-19. Australia\u2019s new live export laws ban live sheep exports from 1 June to 14 September to prevent the mass deaths of sheep from heat stress during summer in the Gulf. But the crew of the Al Kuwait is not able to sail. Twenty people have tested positive to Covid-19 and the rest of the crew of 48, apart from 10 who remain on the ship, are in quarantine in hotels in Perth. The Australian federal agriculture department, which was criticised by the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, for failing to properly inform the state\u2019s health authorities that some crew members had recorded temperatures before the ship docked in Fremantle on 22 May, will have to grant the exporters, Rural Export and Trading WA (RETWA), an exemption to its export licence to allow the shipment to go ahead. Animals Australia\u2019s founder, Lyn White, said the exemption should not be granted. The majority of Australians remain opposed to this trade despite reassurances that the welfare of animals will be prioritised. If an exemption to newly minted laws to halt trade in the northern summer is granted, public confidence in the regulator will be shattered ... [It] would see this legislation fail at its first test and open the department to a flood of exemption requests. An RSPCA senior policy officer, Dr Jed Goodfellow, said the RSPCA had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the risk to the sheep if the shipment is allowed to go ahead. As has happened on multiple previous occasions where this volatile trade has been disrupted, sheep can be held safely and comfortably in the feedlot where they are now, until they can be transported and slaughtered humanely in WA abattoirs. The only financial impact will be on the multimillion-dollar companies that own these sheep, Kuwait Livestock Transport and Trading (KLTT) and its subsidiary Rural Exports and Trading WA (RETWA). These are companies that \u2013 given the delays that routinely occur in live export loading \u2013 took a very unreasonable risk in trying to rush out this last shipment so close to the deadline. That risk has now foreseeably backfired, and these sheep \u2013 as well as the reputation of the wider industry \u2013 should not be forced to pay the price for that dangerous risk-taking behaviour. RETWA is connected to Emanuel Exports, a live export company that lost its export licence over animal welfare concerns in 2018. AAP has reported that talks are under way to move the sheep to the rebadged Awassi Express, which has been modified to comply with airflow requirements and is now called the Anna Marra. The summer export ban was introduced in response to a deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in 2017 in which 2,400 sheep died. Almost 80 school students in Victoria, Australia, are under self-isolation orders after a positive case at one Melbourne high school, Keilor Downs Secondary College, led to students from three schools being isolated. Meanwhile, workers in Victoria who have been able to work from home for the past few months have been told they will have to continue doing so as all other restrictions on people leaving their home are lifted. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said the risk of the virus spreading on peak hour public transport is too great. The Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, will give an update at 10am. We will bring you that live. Good morning and welcome to our ongoing global coverage of the coronavirus crisis. This is how things stand. The US president, Donald Trump, has said he is terminating the nation\u2019s relationship with the World Health Organisation. The United Kingdom is lifting lockdown restrictions in June but a senior health adviser to the government has warned that is happening too early. There are still 8,000 infections a day in the UK. Australia, which is also easing restrictions in many states on 1 June, has had fewer than 50 new cases a day for the past several weeks and has fewer than 500 active cases recorded nationwide. The death toll in Brazil has passed that of Spain as the country becomes the fifth-worst affected. One-tenth of all coronavirus cases in Australia have been traced back to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, but a report published today found that in a pandemic practice drill in 2019 communications between cruise ships, government health and border control was found to be \u201crobust and well-practised\u201d. That\u2019s not how it played out in March. Elsewhere, Russia has suffered its biggest daily increase in deaths \u2013 232 in 24 hours \u2013 bringing the nationwide total to 4,374. Iran has identified more coronavirus cases in a day than in any time since early April; 2,819 more people tested positive on Friday. And health authorities in South Africa say they have a backlog of more than 100,000 unprocessed tests. Sweden, which pursued a herd immunity policy, has been excluded from Norwegian and Danish plans to reopen to tourists. The UK, France, Spain and Italy have also been excluded from Greece reopening its borders to arrivals from 29 countries on 15 June. Also in Australia there has been barely a pause to mourn the loss of the council of Australian governments (Coag), which had been the central federalist mechanism since 1992. It\u2019s been replaced permanently by the national cabinet, established in March to manage the Covid-19 response.",

      "body": "<p>Throughout this pandemic, Boris Johnson has claimed to have been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science\">following the science</a>\u201d. By parroting this epistemological nonsense, ministers are encouraging us to believe that they are only doing what the scientists tell them. It is but a short step from there to blaming the government\u2019s scientific advisers for the UK\u2019s terrible death toll. This lends added significance to the roll call of prominent scientists \u2013 including some senior members of the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee for emergencies (Sage) \u2013 who have this weekend publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">made clear their concerns</a> that the government is relaxing the lockdown in England too early.</p> <p>The decision about when and how to relax the lockdown is political. It can only ever be informed, not dictated, by the uncertain science, and must also weigh the risks and costs imposed by the lockdown itself. This is why it is critical that politicians are unfailingly transparent about the basis on which they are making their decisions \u2013 not just the scientific advice, but the other assumptions and value judgments that are informing their decisions.</p> <p>We have seen no such transparency from Johnson about his decision to relax social distancing restrictions from tomorrow, when many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/28/reopening-english-schools-on-monday-could-lead-to-new-surge\">schools will be reopening</a>, many people will be returning to work, and groups of families and friends will be able to gather outdoors for the first time in weeks. The announcement came after the most tumultuous week for the government yet, during which Johnson expended every last shred of his political capital on saving his adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/dominic-cummings-borish-johnson-tories-election-trust\">Dominic Cummings</a> after he was revealed to have broken the government\u2019s lockdown guidance several times. There was no publication of the scientific advice, no openness about how the various risks have been traded off against each other, no explanation as to why the government thinks it is safe to make so many changes simultaneously rather than adopt a more cautious approach. It leaves the impression of a hapless prime minister so dependent on his adviser that he is not only willing to trash the integrity of the government\u2019s public health messaging, but to rush forwards a relaxation of the lockdown before the country is ready in order to distract from his political tribulations.</p> <p>The lockdown has imposed immense and unequal costs on society: children are being abused at home without the safety net of going to school; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/27/schools-shutdown-likely-to-widen-attainment-gap-says-ofsted-chief\">attainment gap</a> between children from poor and more affluent backgrounds is widening; grandparents have missed out on seeing their new grandchildren; people who have not been eligible for government financial support have suffered intense economic hardship. But the right approach is to gradually and cautiously reopen society step by step, only once infection rates have further dwindled, and there are proper systems in place to track and manage local outbreaks in order to minimise the risk of a second wave of infections. We believe that, science permitting, the right prioritisation would have been schools, then family contact, and only then the economy; the government can far more easily alleviate economic hardship than the educational, social and emotional hardships of lockdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson has made a conscious decision to rubbish the integrity of the government\u2019s public health message</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, the government has thrown caution to the wind by announcing a hotchpotch of measures while the estimated reproduction rate or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">R number</a> of the virus remains dangerously close to one, the value above which we will again see exponential growth in infections, and the Joint Biosecurity Centre has maintained the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-lockdown-restrictions-cases-deaths-threat-level-boris-johnson-a9538751.html\">threat level at \u201chigh\u201d</a>. As Professor John Edmunds of Sage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">has pointed out</a>, if R were to reach one, that would imply a steady rate of 8,000 new infections a day, or 80 deaths a day assuming a fatality rate of 1%: 2,400 deaths a month until a vaccine or more effective treatments are developed. If R goes above one, the death toll could be far worse.</p> <p>Sage has estimated that the limited reopening of primary schools alone <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-sage-half-class-rotas-safest-way-keep-r-down\">could increase R by 0.2</a>; yet this is only one of a number of measures being introduced from tomorrow. The rushed and botched launch of the test, track and trace scheme has not disguised the fact that it will not be fully operational until the end of June; and the government has wasted weeks devising and putting into operation a system reliant on outsourcing contact tracing to low-paid call centre handlers without involving local councils and their considerable expertise in contact tracing.

      "bodyText": "Throughout this pandemic, Boris Johnson has claimed to have been \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. By parroting this epistemological nonsense, ministers are encouraging us to believe that they are only doing what the scientists tell them. It is but a short step from there to blaming the government\u2019s scientific advisers for the UK\u2019s terrible death toll. This lends added significance to the roll call of prominent scientists \u2013 including some senior members of the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee for emergencies (Sage) \u2013 who have this weekend publicly made clear their concerns that the government is relaxing the lockdown in England too early. The decision about when and how to relax the lockdown is political. It can only ever be informed, not dictated, by the uncertain science, and must also weigh the risks and costs imposed by the lockdown itself. This is why it is critical that politicians are unfailingly transparent about the basis on which they are making their decisions \u2013 not just the scientific advice, but the other assumptions and value judgments that are informing their decisions. We have seen no such transparency from Johnson about his decision to relax social distancing restrictions from tomorrow, when many schools will be reopening, many people will be returning to work, and groups of families and friends will be able to gather outdoors for the first time in weeks. The announcement came after the most tumultuous week for the government yet, during which Johnson expended every last shred of his political capital on saving his adviser Dominic Cummings after he was revealed to have broken the government\u2019s lockdown guidance several times. There was no publication of the scientific advice, no openness about how the various risks have been traded off against each other, no explanation as to why the government thinks it is safe to make so many changes simultaneously rather than adopt a more cautious approach. It leaves the impression of a hapless prime minister so dependent on his adviser that he is not only willing to trash the integrity of the government\u2019s public health messaging, but to rush forwards a relaxation of the lockdown before the country is ready in order to distract from his political tribulations. The lockdown has imposed immense and unequal costs on society: children are being abused at home without the safety net of going to school; the attainment gap between children from poor and more affluent backgrounds is widening; grandparents have missed out on seeing their new grandchildren; people who have not been eligible for government financial support have suffered intense economic hardship. But the right approach is to gradually and cautiously reopen society step by step, only once infection rates have further dwindled, and there are proper systems in place to track and manage local outbreaks in order to minimise the risk of a second wave of infections. We believe that, science permitting, the right prioritisation would have been schools, then family contact, and only then the economy; the government can far more easily alleviate economic hardship than the educational, social and emotional hardships of lockdown. Instead, the government has thrown caution to the wind by announcing a hotchpotch of measures while the estimated reproduction rate or R number of the virus remains dangerously close to one, the value above which we will again see exponential growth in infections, and the Joint Biosecurity Centre has maintained the threat level at \u201chigh\u201d. As Professor John Edmunds of Sage has pointed out, if R were to reach one, that would imply a steady rate of 8,000 new infections a day, or 80 deaths a day assuming a fatality rate of 1%: 2,400 deaths a month until a vaccine or more effective treatments are developed. If R goes above one, the death toll could be far worse. Sage has estimated that the limited reopening of primary schools alone could increase R by 0.2; yet this is only one of a number of measures being introduced from tomorrow. The rushed and botched launch of the test, track and trace scheme has not disguised the fact that it will not be fully operational until the end of June; and the government has wasted weeks devising and putting into operation a system reliant on outsourcing contact tracing to low-paid call centre handlers without involving local councils and their considerable expertise in contact tracing. We simply do not have the systems in place to manage local outbreaks; by the time death rates start rising again, the 21-day average lag between infection and death means it will be too late. Moreover, in protecting Cummings, Johnson has made a conscious decision to rubbish the integrity of the government\u2019s public health message at a time that could not be more sensitive. Just as members of the public are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days if they develop symptoms or are contacted by a tracer, as society opens up around them they are hearing ministers fanning out across the airwaves to defend an adviser who repeatedly flouted the rules. The sense of public anger that has been generated by this breathtaking level of hypocrisy is righteous and palpable. Meanwhile, the government continues to brief further potential relaxations of the lockdown, such as a reopening of pubs, to favoured parts of the press in order to generate good news headlines. We simply cannot, in good faith, understand why the government appears prepared to take such reckless risks with the health of the nation.

      "bodyText": "Hawaii\u2019s \u201cgarden island\u201d, Kauai, is known for its breathtaking scenery and laid-back vibe, a place of plunging waterfalls and cliffs cloaked in green tropical forests. But beyond its beauty it is one of the Pentagon\u2019s most valued testing and training sites in the Pacific. In Hawaii, where the military is the second-largest economic driver, after tourism, weapons testing and training enjoy widespread support, but some residents view the islands\u2019 highly militarized state as misguided or even illegal. In missile defense circles, Kauai is known for its outsized role in weapons testing at the navy\u2019s Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands (PMRF), which its commanding officer, Capt Timothy Young, likens to a sports stadium that provides a venue for customers (weapons manufacturers, government agencies and military branches) to train people or test new technology. That technology includes ballistic missiles, rockets, drones and hypersonic weapons. In March at PMRF, the US navy and army collaborated in the test launch of a common-hypersonic glide body, which the Pentagon described as a major milestone in its goal to enhance its \u201chypersonic warfighting capabilities in the early- to mid-2020s\u201d. Donald Trump said China and Russia had left the US no choice but to develop hypersonic weapons, which he described as \u201csuper duper\u201d missiles. Hypersonic weapons fly faster than five times the speed of sound, making it possible to hit targets thousands of miles away in minutes. The US, Russia and China are all investing heavily in them. Young declined an in-person interview but in an email said: \u201cWe test systems and facilitate the fleet\u2019s training that ultimately enable our safety and security.\u201d As the island\u2019s third-largest employer, PMRF also provides jobs that are attractive in a community where the tourism and service sector often pay less and are vulnerable during disruptions like the coronavirus pandemic and associated mandatory 14-day quarantine for all visitors from outside the islands. Young said he appreciated the relationship the base has with multi-generational Hawaiian families. He added that PMRF partnered with local businesses to encourage science, technology, reading and math education. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do when helping to educate our young people, but it also makes good business sense to develop a local workforce.\u201d Space force comes to Hawaii PMRF will soon be offering even more jobs on the island as Hawaii\u2019s air national guard stands up the 293rd offensive space control squadron using existing infrastructure on the base. The squadron will be one of four units administered by the national guard in California, Colorado, Florida and Hawaii. Tasked with space electronic warfare, the squadron\u2019s primary mission will be \u201cto protect and defend satellite communications systems\u201d, said Ryan Okahara, the Hawaii air national guard brigadier general. Kauai\u2019s mayor, Derek SK Kawakami, welcomes the military presence, saying PMRF sets a good example of how a military base can be embraced by the community through its volunteer efforts, emergency relief contributions, public outreach and openness to civilians. \u201cWhether we have a military here or not, if we\u2019re making enemies out there, we\u2019re a target and so it\u2019s best to have at least a shield of defense to protect our people,\u201d Kawakami said. \u201cBecause we have a presence here, it makes us less vulnerable than not having a presence. \u201cHistorically, Hawaii has been a strategic location for national and international defense,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cI understand many people may have mixed feelings about that. For myself, I understand the importance of keeping our nation protected and our state protected.\u201d Critics of Hawaii\u2019s large military presence are less sanguine. Kyle Kajihiro, an instructor with the department of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said: \u201cThe technologies involved in these space programs are not only for defense; they can also enhance offensive capabilities. The expansion of these programs in Hawaii would cause countries who may be in the crosshairs of US war plans to perceive us as a threat. \u201cHistory teaches us what happens when other powerful countries weaponize our islands \u2026 If the 2018 false missile alert did anything positive, it forced a conversation about how the massive military presence puts a big target over these islands.\u201d Sparky Rodrigues, a Native Hawaiian activist opposed to the military in Hawaii, called the US military presence, which dates back to the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, an illegal occupation. The bombing of Pearl Harbor, Rodrigues said, wasn\u2019t an attack on Hawaii but on the US military. \u201cThey have basically occupied the space, taken the land, denied access to our resources from long ago, and we are now stuck with them holding the checkbook that supports our families.\u201d That sentiment has caused a rift in the Hawaiian community. \u201cWe are being poisoned and fed at the same time,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cThe military has poisoned our economy, they\u2019ve poisoned our land, they\u2019ve poisoned the air. Every time they do training and missile firing, there\u2019s contamination that goes into the environment \u2026 I don\u2019t want Hawaii to be known as the purveyor of death.\u201d Rockets and missiles Base proponents value PMRF as a facility that can accommodate testing and training below the sea, on land, in the sky and in space. In 2018, Japan\u2019s ground self-defense forces achieved a first when they launched Type 12 surface-to-surface missiles and Himars rockets at PMRF during the huge Rim of the Pacific maritime exercises. PMRF also hosts the Kauai test facility, operated by Sandia, one of the department of energy\u2019s national nuclear laboratories. KTF, which has operated on Kauai since 1962, has supported more than 450 launches, including a series of experimental rocket tests in 2019 to test new technologies being considered for future nuclear weapons life-extension programs. Two of PMRF\u2019s most important functions have been for testing Lockheed Martin\u2019s Aegis Ashore and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems. Thaad, which is intended to neutralize short-, medium- and limited intermediate-range ballistic missiles, is deployed in Guam, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel and South Korea. Aegis Ashore, a land adaptation of a ship-based BMD system, was introduced to a US naval base in Romania in 2016 and will deployed at a missile defense facility in Poland where it is years behind schedule and $96m over budget. Japan also plans to deploy Aegis Ashore in two locations by 2025. In 2019 and earlier this year, Japan\u2019s defense minister traveled to PMRF to inspect the system. And while Tokyo and Washington insist Aegis Ashore is meant to defend against North Korea and Iran, both Moscow and Beijing see the system as an offensive threat. Patrick Shanahan, the former acting secretary of defense, may have stoked those fears when he announced US policy would \u201cshift towards greater integration of offensive and defensive capabilities because missile defense necessarily includes missile offense\u201d. PMRF\u2019s expanding role comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. What\u2019s more, countries around the world are facing the coronavirus pandemic and an economic freefall, with markets plunging, businesses collapsing and the world driven into crisis. The US Congress has already passed nearly $3tn in emergency response packages to the Covid-19 pandemic, as the Trump administration\u2019s 2021 budget sharply increases spending on nuclear weapons, including a new low-yield submarine-launched nuclear weapon and a spending surge on intercontinental ballistic missiles. With the 2019 demise of the INF treaty, the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, growing worries that the US appears poised to abandon the bilateral New Start treaty, which might not be renewed in 2021, and the US Missile Defense Agency seeking new ways to use BMD systems, PMRF\u2019s role appears likely to grow. William Hartung, the director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, worries about the lack of public awareness of dramatic policy shifts or scrutiny of emerging technologies, such as hypersonic weapons, that reduce an already short response time to missile launches, as well as the further weaponization of space. \u201cI think the economic impact of these military facilities all over the country is a big obstacle to changing how we spend our money, what kind of weapons are pursued, what nuclear policy we have, how we approach space,\u201d Hartung said. \u201cBecause these places become entrenched, local communities depend on them economically and then there\u2019s less inclination to question the value or the danger of the activities that are going on.\u201d In the face of institutionalized military opacity, Hartung said there was an incentive for the military to avoid openness because \u201ctransparency can lead to criticism, criticism can lead to changes in policy, and so if they can stick to generic language and general boilerplate it may serve their interests.

      "bodyText": "You\u2019d be forgiven if you hadn\u2019t noticed. His verbal bombshells are louder than ever, but Donald J Trump is no longer president of the United States. By having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America, Trump has abdicated his office. He is not governing. He\u2019s golfing, watching cable TV and tweeting. How has Trump responded to the widespread unrest following the murder in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for minutes as he was handcuffed on the ground? Trump called the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened to have them shot. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d he tweeted, parroting a former Miami police chief whose words spurred race riots in the late 1960s. On Saturday, he gloated about \u201cthe most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons\u201d awaiting protesters outside the White House, should they ever break through Secret Service lines. Trump\u2019s response to the last three ghastly months of mounting disease and death has been just as heedless. Since claiming Covid-19 was a \u201cDemocratic hoax\u201d and muzzling public health officials, he has punted management of the coronavirus to the states. Governors have had to find ventilators to keep patients alive and protective equipment for hospital and other essential workers who lack it, often bidding against each other. They have had to decide how, when and where to reopen their economies. Trump has claimed \u201cno responsibility at all\u201d for testing and contact-tracing \u2013 the keys to containing the virus. His new \u201cplan\u201d places responsibility on states to do their own testing and contact-tracing. Trump is also awol in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 41 million Americans are jobless. In the coming weeks temporary eviction moratoriums are set to end in half of the states. One-fifth of Americans missed rent payments this month. Extra unemployment benefits are set to expire at the end of July. What is Trump\u2019s response? Like Herbert Hoover, who in 1930 said \u201cthe worst is behind us\u201d as thousands starved, Trump says the economy will improve and does nothing about the growing hardship.

He tweets bogus threats that he has no power to carry out \u2013 withholding funds from states that expand absentee voting, \u201coverruling\u201d governors who don\u2019t allow places of worship to reopen \u201cright away\u201d, and punishing Twitter for factchecking him.

      "body": "<p>Soon after she opens her new standup comedy show, <em>Douglas</em>, the Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby challenges the audience by asking: \u201cIf you\u2019re here because of <em>Nanette</em>, why? What the fuck are you expecting of this show? I\u2019m sorry, but, if it\u2019s more trauma, I\u2019m fresh out.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Douglas</a></em>, now available on Netflix, is Gadsby\u2019s follow up to her global standup phenomenon, <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80233611\">Nanette</a></em>. <em>Nanette</em> was a scream of visceral soul-baring, with Gadsby venting her rage and pain about being a woman, being gay, about homophobia (recounting how she\u2019d been beaten up in the street), institutionalised misogyny, and more, all the while deconstructing comedy itself. By the time <em>Nanette</em> aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. <em>Nanette</em> was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">Roxan</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">e Gay</a>, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> would be successful. It was the one thing my trolls and I have in common,\u201d says Gadsby wryly, when she speaks to me over the phone from her Australian home. Gadsby \u201cquit comedy\u201d onstage as part of the <em>Nanette</em> set, but clearly this wasn\u2019t meant literally? \u201cYeah, <em>Nanette</em> was not the end it claimed to be. It was a point of exasperation,\u201d she says. \u201cI was expecting <em>Nanette</em> to put me in a position where I would have to scale back what I did with my comedy. I thought it would alienate my audience. And that was the surprise of <em>Nanette</em> \u2013 what I thought would push me into a corner did the opposite\u2026 I thought, I don\u2019t have to jump, I can do what I want.\u201d</p> <p>Our phone call suffers from occasional time lags, which sometimes means I ask Gadsby a new question while she\u2019s still answering the previous one. Gadsby is good-humoured about this, and friendly and engaged. In conversation, she\u2019s still recognisable from her quick-witted stage persona, just with the voltage turned down. Was it a pressure to come back with <em>Douglas</em> after <em>Nanette</em>\u2019s huge success? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel desperate to overcome that because that\u2019s an impossible fight. I just set up camp in the shadow of <em>Nanette</em>.\u201d Later, she says dryly: \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the inevitable fall. What I figure is that \u2013 what goes up must come down.

As a small child, she felt isolated, which she now realises was due to her autism. \u201cYou know when you have a radio and it\u2019s two or three notches out of being on the right station? But there was a lot of consistency in my childhood. We lived in a fairly sheltered world, which is a good thing for someone with autism.

Art history made the world accessible to me. Basically, I never graduated from picture books.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby found her voice in comedy, though, as much as <em>Nanette</em> was praised, it was also widely criticised, which she deals with in <em>Douglas</em>. Some claimed it \u201cwasn\u2019t standup comedy\u201d; it was performance art, a lecture, a one-woman show, group therapy, or \u201cjust wasn\u2019t funny\u201d. Some men seemed personally affronted. \u201cWell, yeah, you know people who call other people snowflakes are projecting,\u201d says Gadsby. She says in <em>Douglas</em>: \u201cYour hate is my vaccine.\u201d Does that indicate she\u2019s fairly immune to the trolling? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the micro-dosing thing,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cEvery time one of these blokes comes in and says something that they believe is devastating, what confounds me is that they think they\u2019re original. That it\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019ve heard this. You know? I\u2019ve lived a life. I\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Gadsby expected to be attacked: \u201cYou don\u2019t do a show like <em>Nanette</em> without a tough shell. I\u2019m fairly robust when it comes to stuff like that.\u201d If anything, she was complimented: \u201cI\u2019m a student of art history. It seems like part and parcel of any shift in form necessarily comes with a resistance. It\u2019s kind of cool to be part of that in comedy. I expect other people to take what I\u2019ve done and bend it out of shape and create something new. And for me that\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nanette</em> could be viewed as key to Gadsby\u2019s personal and professional evolution in that she dumped self-deprecation from her set, saying on stage: \u201cDo you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it\u2019s humiliation.\u201d However, Gadsby doesn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> was \u201cfearless\u201d, pointing out how she briefly refers on stage to being abused as a child, and raped as a young woman, but doesn\u2019t take it further. \u201cAs brave as <em>Nanette</em> was, it wasn\u2019t that brave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, this person I knew raped me. I couldn\u2019t say that. So I wasn\u2019t completely fearless. I made a decision. I chose a trauma that features a stranger performing violence on me. That makes it safe. I don\u2019t know how to wrangle the story on stage where I say someone betrayed me on a profound level. I don\u2019t think I did the bravest thing I possibly could have.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in my head. So, when I'm at home, I'm just throwing thought-orgies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gadsby wasn\u2019t ready to discuss these subjects on stage, which obviously is fine. \u201cWhen it comes to those things, I have to also look after my own trauma,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be in control of the trauma around that before it becomes public property, I believe. And I\u2019m glad I did, because the level of attention I got with <em>Nanette</em> was truly frightening. It felt unsafe.\u201d Gadsby has made references to \u201ctrauma-porn\u201d before. I wonder if that\u2019s a danger for any performer \u2013 audiences demanding more and more, darker and darker? \u201cI think it\u2019s because people want a big narrative around things to understand it. If they don\u2019t understand it, then it didn\u2019t happen. And the danger of that is there\u2019s no straight line through trauma.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby prefers to keep her personal life private (\u201cWith things like relationships, I\u2019m not just talking for myself any more\u201d). A couple of years ago, Gadsby was rumoured to be dating Jill Soloway, the US showrunner, director and writer, responsible for the Emmy-winning <em>Transparent</em>, who identifies as non-binary and non-gender-conforming, though by 2019, Gadsby said they weren\u2019t together.&nbsp;Gadsby tells me that, before the autism diagnosis, she couldn\u2019t maintain relationships. \u201cI was just terrible at relationships but I didn\u2019t know why until I was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me better able to trust my own boundaries. Before I was diagnosed, I had to trust other people with personal instruction. Because I didn\u2019t understand it. Relating to someone emotionally is not something I\u2019m great at. So I would trust them and it became difficult because you can\u2019t always trust other people to take care of your boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby is at pains not to overemphasise the positives about autism. \u201cI still have to negotiate the world, and the world has been built to prioritise neurotypical people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. I\u2019ll never not have autism. What it\u2019s meant is when I close the door, and I\u2019m on my own, it\u2019s a better place.\u201d Right now, during lockdown, she\u2019s relaxing at home, mainly by gardening, or playing with her dogs. \u201cI don\u2019t sit and think. I do and think. I\u2019m always rearranging things. Or building things. I do a bit of woodwork. I garden. I\u2019m very active.\u201d Is she able to switch off fairly easily? \u201cI live in my head. So, when I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m just throwing thought-orgies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2/1_0_1335_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben King/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gadsby remains concerned that too many talented women in comedy don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. And, while she\u2019s glad that #MeToo saw the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a> convicted, she doesn\u2019t feel that\u2019s the end of it: \u201cWhat needs to change is the toxic culture that enables that behaviour. These men could not have done those things without the power structures and the yes-men and the silent people around them. These are kind of cultish scenarios where good people turn a blind eye, and almost convince themselves that they didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby refers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/07/sincerely-louis-ck-review-standup-comedy-me-too\">Louis CK</a> in <em>Douglas</em> (\u201cHe is like the anti-vaxx of comedy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d) . After finally admitting to repeated grave sexual misconduct, Louis CK was further criticised for attempting a comeback. \u201cHe\u2019s just digging his own grave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cHis whole career was built on how he liked to talk about really dangerous things. And that was what was interesting about it. That took an enormous amount of skill. And with that, the audience had to trust him. Nobody trusts him any more.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re almost out of time. While live comedy is as affected by the coronavirus pandemic as everything else. Gadsby now has <em>Douglas</em> and <em>Nanette</em> out, and her memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Steps-Nanette-Hannah-Gadsby/dp/1911630237/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KWUETO6WLGRO&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=ten+steps+to+nanette&amp;qid=1590073740&amp;sprefix=ten+steps+to+%2Caps%2C138&amp;sr=8-1\">Ten Steps to Nanette</a></em>, is to be published next year. She tells me that, creatively, she\u2019s still driven, she still wants to take risks, she\u2019s still drawn to subjects because she wants to understand them: \u201cGenerally my thoughts are occupied with things that grab my curiosity. And that\u2019s a real privilege of success. <em>Nanette</em> changed my life,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIf anyone knows me, more likely than not, it\u2019s because of <em>Nanette</em>. I had a fairly small sphere of influence before <em>Nanette</em>, and now I have a large one. That has to be acknowledged. You have to acknowledge that that\u2019s how people define you. You also have to let those people accept how you define yourself.\u201d</p> <p><em>Douglas is out now on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Netflix</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct the publication date of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s memoir</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Soon after she opens her new standup comedy show, Douglas, the Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby challenges the audience by asking: \u201cIf you\u2019re here because of Nanette, why? What the fuck are you expecting of this show? I\u2019m sorry, but, if it\u2019s more trauma, I\u2019m fresh out.\u201d Douglas, now available on Netflix, is Gadsby\u2019s follow up to her global standup phenomenon, Nanette. Nanette was a scream of visceral soul-baring, with Gadsby venting her rage and pain about being a woman, being gay, about homophobia (recounting how she\u2019d been beaten up in the street), institutionalised misogyny, and more, all the while deconstructing comedy itself. By the time Nanette aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. Nanette was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as Roxane Gay, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think that Nanette would be successful. It was the one thing my trolls and I have in common,\u201d says Gadsby wryly, when she speaks to me over the phone from her Australian home. Gadsby \u201cquit comedy\u201d onstage as part of the Nanette set, but clearly this wasn\u2019t meant literally? \u201cYeah, Nanette was not the end it claimed to be. It was a point of exasperation,\u201d she says. \u201cI was expecting Nanette to put me in a position where I would have to scale back what I did with my comedy. I thought it would alienate my audience. And that was the surprise of Nanette \u2013 what I thought would push me into a corner did the opposite\u2026 I thought, I don\u2019t have to jump, I can do what I want.\u201d Our phone call suffers from occasional time lags, which sometimes means I ask Gadsby a new question while she\u2019s still answering the previous one. Gadsby is good-humoured about this, and friendly and engaged. In conversation, she\u2019s still recognisable from her quick-witted stage persona, just with the voltage turned down. Was it a pressure to come back with Douglas after Nanette\u2019s huge success? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel desperate to overcome that because that\u2019s an impossible fight. I just set up camp in the shadow of Nanette.\u201d Later, she says dryly: \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the inevitable fall. What I figure is that \u2013 what goes up must come down. I want to be able to negotiate that as gracefully as possible.\u201d One thing that struck Gadsby was that the level of attention she got for Nanette could be \u201caddictive\u201d. \u201cAnd the only way you get that level of attention is you do something that has an impact. I managed to do that once but I don\u2019t expect that every time. Unless I try to stay shocking and that\u2019s not what I want to do. I made a choice \u2013 that not everything I do will make that kind of impact \u2013 and that\u2019s good.\u201d The main focus of Douglas is Gadsby\u2019s high-functioning autism. Other themes range from chauvinism and male ownership of culture (the show is named after one of Gadsby\u2019s dogs, but also refers to the \u201cpouch of Douglas\u201d, a part of the female anatomy, named by a male scientist), America (\u201cMaking fun of Americans is still technically punching up, but that window is closing\u201d), anti-vaxxers, her now-signature art history musings (Gadsby has a degree in art history and curatorship), all the way through to golf, dog parks, Taylor Swift and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Douglas is markedly more playful than Nanette: \u201cI did all the heavy lifting with Nanette, so I thought it would defeat the purpose \u2013 you know, dwelling,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIt felt like a time to be more playful, show a breadth of form.

And the danger of that is there\u2019s no straight line through trauma.\u201d Gadsby prefers to keep her personal life private (\u201cWith things like relationships, I\u2019m not just talking for myself any more\u201d). A couple of years ago, Gadsby was rumoured to be dating Jill Soloway, the US showrunner, director and writer, responsible for the Emmy-winning Transparent, who identifies as non-binary and non-gender-conforming, though by 2019, Gadsby said they weren\u2019t together. Gadsby tells me that, before the autism diagnosis, she couldn\u2019t maintain relationships. \u201cI was just terrible at relationships but I didn\u2019t know why until I was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me better able to trust my own boundaries. Before I was diagnosed, I had to trust other people with personal instruction. Because I didn\u2019t understand it. Relating to someone emotionally is not something I\u2019m great at. So I would trust them and it became difficult because you can\u2019t always trust other people to take care of your boundaries.\u201d Gadsby is at pains not to overemphasise the positives about autism. \u201cI still have to negotiate the world, and the world has been built to prioritise neurotypical people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. I\u2019ll never not have autism. What it\u2019s meant is when I close the door, and I\u2019m on my own, it\u2019s a better place.\u201d Right now, during lockdown, she\u2019s relaxing at home, mainly by gardening, or playing with her dogs. \u201cI don\u2019t sit and think. I do and think. I\u2019m always rearranging things. Or building things. I do a bit of woodwork. I garden. I\u2019m very active.\u201d Is she able to switch off fairly easily? \u201cI live in my head. So, when I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m just throwing thought-orgies.\u201d Gadsby remains concerned that too many talented women in comedy don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. And, while she\u2019s glad that #MeToo saw the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby convicted, she doesn\u2019t feel that\u2019s the end of it: \u201cWhat needs to change is the toxic culture that enables that behaviour. These men could not have done those things without the power structures and the yes-men and the silent people around them. These are kind of cultish scenarios where good people turn a blind eye, and almost convince themselves that they didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d Gadsby refers to Louis CK in Douglas (\u201cHe is like the anti-vaxx of comedy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d) . After finally admitting to repeated grave sexual misconduct, Louis CK was further criticised for attempting a comeback. \u201cHe\u2019s just digging his own grave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cHis whole career was built on how he liked to talk about really dangerous things. And that was what was interesting about it. That took an enormous amount of skill. And with that, the audience had to trust him. Nobody trusts him any more.\u201d We\u2019re almost out of time. While live comedy is as affected by the coronavirus pandemic as everything else. Gadsby now has Douglas and Nanette out, and her memoir, Ten Steps to Nanette, is to be published next year. She tells me that, creatively, she\u2019s still driven, she still wants to take risks, she\u2019s still drawn to subjects because she wants to understand them: \u201cGenerally my thoughts are occupied with things that grab my curiosity. And that\u2019s a real privilege of success. Nanette changed my life,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIf anyone knows me, more likely than not, it\u2019s because of Nanette. I had a fairly small sphere of influence before Nanette, and now I have a large one. That has to be acknowledged. You have to acknowledge that that\u2019s how people define you. You also have to let those people accept how you define yourself.\u201d Douglas is out now on Netflix This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct the publication date of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s memoir",

The country has almost 500,000 cases, second behind the US. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro remain the hardest-hit states in Brazil, while per capita rates are higher in the country\u2019s impoverished north and north-east, where health facilities are reaching capacity. Brazil\u2019s ministry of health says it cannot predict when the country\u2019s outbreak will peak, and experts say the number of cases could be 15 times higher than the confirmed figure because there has been no widespread testing. The pandemic has become an intensely political issue in Brazil where state governors and city mayors have implemented restrictive measures despite being berated by president Jair Bolsonaro, who has attacked \u201cthe tyranny of total quarantine\u201d. Further north in Mexico, there were 2,885 new cases of coronavirus registered on Saturday and 364 more deaths, bringing the total numbers to 87,512 cases and 9,779 fatalities, according to data from health authorities. Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals are planning a national march to demand better personal protective equipment (PPE). Government figures show that nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, one of the highest rates in the world. China recorded two new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday, down from four the day before, data from the country\u2019s health authority showed on Sunday. The country\u2019s economy continues to suffer under the impact of the pandemic, with figures released on Sunday showing a huge slump in exports.

However, the closely watched manufacturing sector purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) was 50.6 in May, compared with 50.8 in April, pointing to some recovery in the industrial sector. Analysts had expected 51.0. Other developments around the world include: A group of British public health officials and scientists has written to Boris Johnson to warn him that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and that it posed real danger to life when lockdown measures were lifted this week. Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said on Saturday that professional sport would resume in the UK on Monday with horse racing the first out of the gates. \u201cThe British sporting recovery has begun,\u201d he told the daily government press briefing.

But some of the venues that helped launch musical careers from Status Quo to the Sex Pistols are now far from the spotlight, languishing in corners of London as laundrettes, fried chicken joints and even police stations. Now, in an attempt to save their placein the capital\u2019s cultural history, a music promoter turned photographer has documented 150 landmarks of the capital\u2019s jazz, blues, rock, folk, punk and indie history. Paul Talling\u2019s new photographic essay includes dozens of pubs and bars where the likes of Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s Deep Purple and Siouxsie and the Banshees first tuned up their guitars.

The former venue is now the Nova Club below Dirty Harry\u2019s of Soho, whose boxed-off neon-sign in the window advises customers: \u201cThis Is Not A Strip Club\u201d. The Ricky-Tick, 1a High Street, Hounslow This venue, above a car showroom in west London, was originally called the Attic Club and opened in 1964 with the likes of Georgie Fame and Geno Washington playing there.

      "body": "<p>The eurozone\u2019s 19 member countries are braced for a dramatic downturn. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned last week that the bloc\u2019s collective GDP was likely to shrink by between 8% and 12% this year, having concluded that the ECB\u2019s \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d scenarios were the only ones worth considering.</p> <p>The economic consequences of coronavirus are dire already, with France and Italy in recession. France\u2019s GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020, following a decline of 0.1% in the preceding three months. Italy saw its GDP fall by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, in the wake of a 0.3% decline in late 2019. As a whole, eurozone GDP decreased by 3.8% in the first three months of 2020 \u2013 the sharpest quarterly decline since records began in 1995.</p> <p>The betting is that Lagarde and the rest of the ECB board will use this week\u2019s meeting to expand its \u20ac750bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\" title=\"\">Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme</a> (PEPP). For many ECB-watchers, this will show how important the PEPP has been during lockdown and offer proof, if that were needed, that states are struggling to revive their economies.</p> <p>The programme, which lets the ECB fund private companies and government budgets by purchasing corporate debt and sovereign bonds, will probably increase to \u20ac1 trillion and could eventually reach \u20ac1.5tn.</p> <p>Lagarde has repeated the mantra of her predecessor, Mario Draghi: the ECB will do whatever it takes to keep the eurozone economies afloat. This should reassure businesses and consumers that any financial wobbles, wherever they crop up inside the eurozone, will be confronted by the ECB\u2019s limitless supply of funds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is increasing nervousness in Italy and Spain, where the ECB plays a crucial funding role, that a recent German constitutional court ruling could circumscribe the ECB\u2019s power. This month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\" title=\"\">Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court set aside a 2018 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling</a> and questioned the legality of ECB asset purchases. The German judges said the ECB had overstepped its mandate with the programme, which in turn prompted the ECJ to issue a polite reminder that it alone has the power to decide whether EU bodies are breaching the bloc\u2019s rules. It had ruled in 2018 that such a bond-buying programme was legal. And thus battle lines between Brussels and Berlin have been drawn.</p> <p>Speaking this month, an EU official said: \u201cThis raises a couple of fundamental issues \u2026 first is the authority of a judgment of the European court of justice which has definitely ruled on the validity of the decisions of the ECB. This goes to the very basis of the European Union. The European Union is based on law, on agreement, on the common rules we have.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the bailout programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing. The political and economic threat of not resolving the row could be seismic, and the help of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be required. Merkel, the leader of the eurozone\u2019s most powerful economy, has said that a clash between Brussels and Germany can be avoided if, as per the German court ruling, the ECB illustrates the necessity of its bond-buying scheme.</p> <p>If the standoff is not resolved and the ECB\u2019s rescue programme is stymied, then the eurozone\u2019s recession will deepen and political and economic fault lines in the EU will widen. A lot is at stake at this week\u2019s meeting, and Lagarde needs the EU and Germany to square their differences.</p> <h2>Sunak must go further on furlough<br></h2> <p>The chancellor has clearly listened to demands that his main employment subsidy scheme should be scaled down gradually. A cliff-edge that loomed in August for the 8.4 million workers furloughed since April has become a gentler slope, although there are still huge risks ahead for Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s 32 million workers and the economy\u2019s prospects of emerging from the crisis relatively unscathed.</p> <p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme currently pays 80% of a worker\u2019s salary up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. Until last week, the chancellor was going to change the terms so that employers received only 60% of a worker\u2019s wages from 1 August. This would have been a huge cost to tens of thousands of shuttered businesses. Sunak has noted this. From August, employers will only need to find the money for employers\u2019 national insurance and pension payments for furloughed staff.</p> <p>Then comes the slope: from 1 September the government will pay 70% of wages. During October it will be 60%. Self-employed workers will receive a matching grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits to cover three months from August.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is a missing element from Sunak\u2019s plans. There are industries that will receive very little or no income from paying customers from now until October and beyond. What is the chancellor going to do to rescue Britain\u2019s mighty tourism industry, its leisure centres, gyms, hotels, bars and nightclubs? Physical distancing will limit their recovery until, or if, a vaccine arrives.</p> <p>They should be candidates for further support after October. It would be tragic if the UK reduced subsidies before businesses can stand unaided, triggering a jump in bankruptcies and unemployment that would undermine the good work of recent months.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce\u2019s plight signals importance of state support</h2> <p>Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s piled on the pain for the manufacturer last week, marking down its debt \u2013 after 20 years at investment grade \u2013 to junk status.</p> <p>While its defence business \u2013 making parts for fighter jet and nuclear submarine engines \u2013 is largely unaffected, the group\u2019s civil aerospace operation has stuttered alongside the grounded airlines to which it sells engines and servicing contracts. The planned cutting of 9,000 jobs, the bulk of them at UK sites including its Derby base, are a major blow to British engineering.</p> <p>The rating downgrade could have material implications.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone\u2019s 19 member countries are braced for a dramatic downturn. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned last week that the bloc\u2019s collective GDP was likely to shrink by between 8% and 12% this year, having concluded that the ECB\u2019s \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d scenarios were the only ones worth considering. The economic consequences of coronavirus are dire already, with France and Italy in recession. France\u2019s GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020, following a decline of 0.1% in the preceding three months. Italy saw its GDP fall by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, in the wake of a 0.3% decline in late 2019. As a whole, eurozone GDP decreased by 3.8% in the first three months of 2020 \u2013 the sharpest quarterly decline since records began in 1995. The betting is that Lagarde and the rest of the ECB board will use this week\u2019s meeting to expand its \u20ac750bn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). For many ECB-watchers, this will show how important the PEPP has been during lockdown and offer proof, if that were needed, that states are struggling to revive their economies. The programme, which lets the ECB fund private companies and government budgets by purchasing corporate debt and sovereign bonds, will probably increase to \u20ac1 trillion and could eventually reach \u20ac1.5tn. Lagarde has repeated the mantra of her predecessor, Mario Draghi: the ECB will do whatever it takes to keep the eurozone economies afloat. This should reassure businesses and consumers that any financial wobbles, wherever they crop up inside the eurozone, will be confronted by the ECB\u2019s limitless supply of funds. But there is increasing nervousness in Italy and Spain, where the ECB plays a crucial funding role, that a recent German constitutional court ruling could circumscribe the ECB\u2019s power. This month, Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court set aside a 2018 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling and questioned the legality of ECB asset purchases. The German judges said the ECB had overstepped its mandate with the programme, which in turn prompted the ECJ to issue a polite reminder that it alone has the power to decide whether EU bodies are breaching the bloc\u2019s rules. It had ruled in 2018 that such a bond-buying programme was legal. And thus battle lines between Brussels and Berlin have been drawn. Speaking this month, an EU official said: \u201cThis raises a couple of fundamental issues \u2026 first is the authority of a judgment of the European court of justice which has definitely ruled on the validity of the decisions of the ECB. This goes to the very basis of the European Union. The European Union is based on law, on agreement, on the common rules we have.\u201d Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the bailout programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing. The political and economic threat of not resolving the row could be seismic, and the help of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be required. Merkel, the leader of the eurozone\u2019s most powerful economy, has said that a clash between Brussels and Germany can be avoided if, as per the German court ruling, the ECB illustrates the necessity of its bond-buying scheme. If the standoff is not resolved and the ECB\u2019s rescue programme is stymied, then the eurozone\u2019s recession will deepen and political and economic fault lines in the EU will widen. A lot is at stake at this week\u2019s meeting, and Lagarde needs the EU and Germany to square their differences. Sunak must go further on furlough The chancellor has clearly listened to demands that his main employment subsidy scheme should be scaled down gradually. A cliff-edge that loomed in August for the 8.4 million workers furloughed since April has become a gentler slope, although there are still huge risks ahead for Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s 32 million workers and the economy\u2019s prospects of emerging from the crisis relatively unscathed. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme currently pays 80% of a worker\u2019s salary up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. Until last week, the chancellor was going to change the terms so that employers received only 60% of a worker\u2019s wages from 1 August. This would have been a huge cost to tens of thousands of shuttered businesses. Sunak has noted this. From August, employers will only need to find the money for employers\u2019 national insurance and pension payments for furloughed staff. Then comes the slope: from 1 September the government will pay 70% of wages. During October it will be 60%. Self-employed workers will receive a matching grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits to cover three months from August. Nonetheless, there is a missing element from Sunak\u2019s plans. There are industries that will receive very little or no income from paying customers from now until October and beyond. What is the chancellor going to do to rescue Britain\u2019s mighty tourism industry, its leisure centres, gyms, hotels, bars and nightclubs? Physical distancing will limit their recovery until, or if, a vaccine arrives. They should be candidates for further support after October. It would be tragic if the UK reduced subsidies before businesses can stand unaided, triggering a jump in bankruptcies and unemployment that would undermine the good work of recent months. Rolls-Royce\u2019s plight signals importance of state support Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s piled on the pain for the manufacturer last week, marking down its debt \u2013 after 20 years at investment grade \u2013 to junk status. While its defence business \u2013 making parts for fighter jet and nuclear submarine engines \u2013 is largely unaffected, the group\u2019s civil aerospace operation has stuttered alongside the grounded airlines to which it sells engines and servicing contracts. The planned cutting of 9,000 jobs, the bulk of them at UK sites including its Derby base, are a major blow to British engineering. The rating downgrade could have material implications. Many institutional investors are, understandably, banned from buying junk bonds, so S&amp;P\u2019s move could make it more costly for Rolls-Royce to borrow if costs continue to mount. It is also striking that the downgrade came after swingeing cost cuts and Rolls-Royce\u2019s professed willingness to ask for government support. The company, one of the few true global players left in UK manufacturing and a key part of UK defence plans, will be helped if needed; the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has signalled that he would back support. Rolls-Royce\u2019s stock of goodwill with government has also been aided by its involvement in Ventilator Challenge UK, the effort to build machines to treat Covid-19 patients. The financial crisis a decade ago showed that ratings agencies are often more weather vane than fortune teller, but when it comes to crunch time for companies, their views are still important. The junking of Rolls-Royce\u2019s rating shows that investors may not be reliable providers of help for the struggling aerospace sector. S&amp;P warned that Rolls-Royce could be exposed to further losses as the pandemic drags on. If things are this bad for Rolls-Royce, smaller companies, whose size does not warrant a rating agency\u2019s attentions, will be under much greater pressure.",

      "body": "<p>They are known as MBs \u2013 microbeats \u2013 small sections of London synonymous with drugs and violence. The scruffy strip of shops that lines London Road outside West Croydon station is the most notorious MB in the south London borough, itself one of the metropolis\u2019s most violent by far.</p> <p>Covid-19 brought a brief hiatus to Croydon\u2019s cycle of violence. Now signs suggest it is slowly returning.</p> <p>At 4.30pm last Wednesday one of the large gangs that operate outside West Croydon station emerged for the first time in weeks, marking old territory. A patrol car slowed beside the group of around 20 \u201cknown faces\u201d. A stand-off ensued. \u201cWe\u2019re from the same house,\u201d said one, referencing the lockdown measures that ban large gatherings.&nbsp;</p> <p>A few months ago the police might have paused to weigh up this potentially escalating altercation. But coronavirus has transformed most things, policing included.</p> <p>As the streets remained eerily quiet and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/15/in-uk-falls-sharply-since-start-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">crime fell</a> during lockdown, the Metropolitan police\u2019s senior command started strategising. Covid-19 had gifted them an opportunity to reclaim the roads.&nbsp;New \u201cviolence suppression units\u201d (VSUs) were set up. These would be given the task of ensuring serious crime never <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/23/proportion-of-suspects-charged-or-summonsed-drops-to-78\">returned</a> to pre-lockdown levels.</p> <p>It was decided that the units, and their 620 officers, would target around 250 of London\u2019s most alarming microbeats. But their arrival also signifies something deeper, confirming the end of austerity, where dwindling police numbers were forced to beat a retreat from the streets. Organised criminals proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/10/senior-officer-suggests-austerity-fuelled-surge-in-violent\">adept</a> at filling the vacuum \u2013 the county line business model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/13/gangs-still-forcing-children-into-county-lines-drug-trafficking-police-covid-19-lockdown\">prospered</a>, with thousands of youngsters exploited as drug runners. Violence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/met-figures-reveal-deeply-troubling-rise-in-serious-in-london\">flourished</a>.</p> <p>Last year the number of homicides in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hit a 10-year high, increasing by more than 50% from levels in 2014.</p> <p>Nine murders have occurred in Croydon over the past 12 months, including three this year \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51290490\">16-year-old</a> knifed in the middle of the rush hour, a <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/croydon-bus-stabbing-murder-probe-launched-a4382376.html\">17-year-old</a> stabbed on a bus, and a <a href=\"https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/18265331.first-picture-croydon-murder-victim-police-continue-appeal-information/\">24-year-old</a> killed after a \u201cfrenzied attack\u201d near a tram stop.</p> <p>The hope is that the VSUs can stem the bloodshed and reclaim the streets. During last Wednesday\u2019s stand-off, an officer from the unit left his car and began remonstrating with the group. Gang members began backing away. They soon dispersed. The assertive policing was deliberate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to being part of society again, recognised as part of the community. It\u2019s a generational battle but at least we\u2019re out there,\u201d said Ch Insp Craig Knight of&nbsp;the Met\u2019s south area command, responsible for the 965,000 people of Croydon, Sutton and Bromley.</p> <p>Last week, the<em> Observer</em> joined one of his VSUs, a foot patrol along the frontline MB of West Croydon station.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"781c002e95ffdd6327483091d1598b50c4ba7ced\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781c002e95ffdd6327483091d1598b50c4ba7ced/0_13_4927_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Met\u2019s violence suppression unit detain youths\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Met\u2019s violence suppression unit detain youths accused of committing a crime on the streets of west Croydon last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the borough\u2019s crime is shoehorned into the nearby grid of streets and shopping areas. On Friday, the Met appealed for witnesses after a 21-year-old was stabbed in the back with a \u2018\u201csmall bladed weapon\u201d on London Road.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the year to April almost 11,000 offences of violence against the person were recorded in Croydon. Only Westminster, which covers central London, counted more. Of those in Croydon, 3,750 were classified as \u201cviolence with injury\u201d. Again, of the capital\u2019s 33 boroughs, only Westminster experienced more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sgt Paul Looker of the VSU gestured ahead as the station came into view. \u201cHere we are, you might notice a difference in the area,\u201d said the 45-year-old.&nbsp;</p> <p>An imitation handgun and a large machete were recently found hidden beneath marrows at a London Road grocery, planted by gang members should a situation escalate. Officers are investigating if the store was complicit or coerced. The latter would be no major revelation. The dealers of London Road are adroit in intimidation. Large groups of 20 congregate on its corners. It might seem odd that criminals would choose to be conspicuous, but fear is currency in west Croydon. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to intimidate \u2013 intimidate rivals, the community, even us,\u201d said Looker.</p> <p>The sizeable groups serve another purpose. Standing in their centre, encircled by layers of enforcers, is the primary drug holder. \u201cOften the carrier is in the middle. If you approach they can start jostling and run in every direction. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Looker.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tensions between gangs periodically flare on London Road.

      "bodyText": "They are known as MBs \u2013 microbeats \u2013 small sections of London synonymous with drugs and violence. The scruffy strip of shops that lines London Road outside West Croydon station is the most notorious MB in the south London borough, itself one of the metropolis\u2019s most violent by far. Covid-19 brought a brief hiatus to Croydon\u2019s cycle of violence. Now signs suggest it is slowly returning. At 4.30pm last Wednesday one of the large gangs that operate outside West Croydon station emerged for the first time in weeks, marking old territory. A patrol car slowed beside the group of around 20 \u201cknown faces\u201d. A stand-off ensued. \u201cWe\u2019re from the same house,\u201d said one, referencing the lockdown measures that ban large gatherings. A few months ago the police might have paused to weigh up this potentially escalating altercation. But coronavirus has transformed most things, policing included. As the streets remained eerily quiet and crime fell during lockdown, the Metropolitan police\u2019s senior command started strategising. Covid-19 had gifted them an opportunity to reclaim the roads. New \u201cviolence suppression units\u201d (VSUs) were set up. These would be given the task of ensuring serious crime never returned to pre-lockdown levels. It was decided that the units, and their 620 officers, would target around 250 of London\u2019s most alarming microbeats. But their arrival also signifies something deeper, confirming the end of austerity, where dwindling police numbers were forced to beat a retreat from the streets. Organised criminals proved adept at filling the vacuum \u2013 the county line business model prospered, with thousands of youngsters exploited as drug runners. Violence flourished. Last year the number of homicides in London hit a 10-year high, increasing by more than 50% from levels in 2014. Nine murders have occurred in Croydon over the past 12 months, including three this year \u2013 a 16-year-old knifed in the middle of the rush hour, a 17-year-old stabbed on a bus, and a 24-year-old killed after a \u201cfrenzied attack\u201d near a tram stop. The hope is that the VSUs can stem the bloodshed and reclaim the streets. During last Wednesday\u2019s stand-off, an officer from the unit left his car and began remonstrating with the group. Gang members began backing away. They soon dispersed. The assertive policing was deliberate. \u201cWe\u2019re back to being part of society again, recognised as part of the community. It\u2019s a generational battle but at least we\u2019re out there,\u201d said Ch Insp Craig Knight of the Met\u2019s south area command, responsible for the 965,000 people of Croydon, Sutton and Bromley. Last week, the Observer joined one of his VSUs, a foot patrol along the frontline MB of West Croydon station. Much of the borough\u2019s crime is shoehorned into the nearby grid of streets and shopping areas. On Friday, the Met appealed for witnesses after a 21-year-old was stabbed in the back with a \u2018\u201csmall bladed weapon\u201d on London Road. During the year to April almost 11,000 offences of violence against the person were recorded in Croydon. Only Westminster, which covers central London, counted more. Of those in Croydon, 3,750 were classified as \u201cviolence with injury\u201d. Again, of the capital\u2019s 33 boroughs, only Westminster experienced more. Sgt Paul Looker of the VSU gestured ahead as the station came into view. \u201cHere we are, you might notice a difference in the area,\u201d said the 45-year-old. An imitation handgun and a large machete were recently found hidden beneath marrows at a London Road grocery, planted by gang members should a situation escalate. Officers are investigating if the store was complicit or coerced. The latter would be no major revelation. The dealers of London Road are adroit in intimidation. Large groups of 20 congregate on its corners. It might seem odd that criminals would choose to be conspicuous, but fear is currency in west Croydon. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to intimidate \u2013 intimidate rivals, the community, even us,\u201d said Looker. The sizeable groups serve another purpose. Standing in their centre, encircled by layers of enforcers, is the primary drug holder. \u201cOften the carrier is in the middle. If you approach they can start jostling and run in every direction. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Looker. Tensions between gangs periodically flare on London Road. A video emerged last year showing youngsters fighting on the street in broad daylight with metal pipes as weapons. Yet the complexities of gangland territory dictate that most have learned to coexist. \u201cThey even help each other, work with each other and sometimes hang out together,\u201d said Looker. While groups maintain an overt presence amid the bustle of London Road, it\u2019s off the main drag where deals are made. The station car park is particularly \u201chot\u201d, so too the labyrinthine alleyways and dead-ends off nearby Mead Place and Derby Road. Further south lies Croydon\u2019s central shopping strip where heroin and crack users shoplift to afford their next hit. Outside Marks &amp; Spencer a fresh-faced officer belonging to Looker\u2019s unit is chatting to teenagers seen \u201cfloating around the area\u201d in a suspicious manner. Alex is one of the Met\u2019s 700 new recruits, the first tranche of the 20,000 extra officers promised in England and Wales by the government. The 26-year-old began policing three weeks ago.

      "body": "<p>With gloriously cloudless skies over north London on the eve of the lockdown easing, the only place to head yesterday morning was to the park \u2013 Friern Barnet Retail Park, conveniently located just off the North Circular road. Here, at the centre of this glistening shrine to suburban consumerism, stands a capacious outlet of the DIY store B&amp;Q, also home of the BBQ set.</p> <p>Government regulations come into force tomorrow that will allow groups of up to six people to meet up outside, including in back gardens. After 10 long and monotonous weeks of social isolation, it\u2019s the news that, if not everybody, then certainly sausage manufacturers have been dreaming of.</p> <p>\u201cYou can even have a barbecue,\u201d announced prime minister Boris Johnson last week in one of those Churchillian moments of national spirit-raising for which he would like to be renowned.&nbsp;That is to say, you can chuck lighter fuel on the charcoal as long as your gathering is socially distanced, everyone washes their hands and exercises what Johnson called \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2013 a disputed concept, these days; it may mean that if you don\u2019t possess a barbecue set yourself, then you can drive 260 miles to see a family member who does have one.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eafc638c8543e949c09ffca0d8d844e08dbd7d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eafc638c8543e949c09ffca0d8d844e08dbd7d2/186_323_5195_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People flocked to London\u2019s St James\u2019s Park on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People flocked to London\u2019s St James\u2019s Park on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatively you can just go to the Friern Barnet Retail Park and pick up a barbecue set for as little as \u00a324. With about 40 people maintaining strict 2m gaps, there was a long queue at B&amp;Q but no sign of a barbecue.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come here to buy construction bits,\u201d explained translator Paula Soto, there with her partner Vijay Bakrania, who works in healthcare technology.&nbsp;</p> <p>They weren\u2019t much interested in grilling hamburgers for up to four friends.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the R number is low enough to take a chance,\u201d said Soto, every bit the amateur epidemiologist that we have all learned to become.&nbsp;</p> <p>Forget the gastronomy, let\u2019s look at the virology, seemed to be the general message.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are social animals. To see someone in the flesh, in 3D, makes a huge difference</p> <footer> <cite>JJ, north Londoner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another customer who had no plans to buy or indeed hold a barbecue was Roy Olchik. He was underwhelmed by the new rules of social engagement. On the one hand he thought the continued social distancing provisions meant that there was little opportunity for \u201cfun as it used to be\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf we meet other families with our children and their children, how can you keep social distance?\u201d</p> <p>And on the other, he agreed with those members of Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory group, who have expressed reservations about relaxing the lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s frightening.\u201d</p> <p>This sentiment was echoed by several people in the queue. Only grandfather John Cook was excited about the new arrangement. He planned to hold a socially distanced party in his garden for his grandson\u2019s birthday on Thursday.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt will definitely lift the spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tended to suppress our feelings a little bit. We\u2019ve tried to be much more cheerful than we really are.\u201d</p> <p>But his improved spirits did not extend to the idea of the Johnsonian-endorsed barbecue. Perhaps fittingly for a B&amp;Q patron, he intended instead to go DIY. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a bring-your-own-food party,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich might get round some of the problems of sharing plates.\u201d</p> <p>If the retail park told a story of caution and anxiety, the actual parks provided a very different picture. Heat and sunshine does something to the British,&nbsp;and nowhere more conspicuously than in city parks. At the first sign of a heatwave we abandon social inhibitions, along with clothes and pretty much all&nbsp;definitions, however disputed, of common sense.&nbsp;</p> <p>As temperatures have hovered around the mid-20s in this most sublime of spring seasons, the parks have played host to some scenes that, in our current puritan climate, can seem positively Hogarthian.

      "bodyText": "With gloriously cloudless skies over north London on the eve of the lockdown easing, the only place to head yesterday morning was to the park \u2013 Friern Barnet Retail Park, conveniently located just off the North Circular road. Here, at the centre of this glistening shrine to suburban consumerism, stands a capacious outlet of the DIY store B&amp;Q, also home of the BBQ set. Government regulations come into force tomorrow that will allow groups of up to six people to meet up outside, including in back gardens. After 10 long and monotonous weeks of social isolation, it\u2019s the news that, if not everybody, then certainly sausage manufacturers have been dreaming of. \u201cYou can even have a barbecue,\u201d announced prime minister Boris Johnson last week in one of those Churchillian moments of national spirit-raising for which he would like to be renowned. That is to say, you can chuck lighter fuel on the charcoal as long as your gathering is socially distanced, everyone washes their hands and exercises what Johnson called \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2013 a disputed concept, these days; it may mean that if you don\u2019t possess a barbecue set yourself, then you can drive 260 miles to see a family member who does have one. Alternatively you can just go to the Friern Barnet Retail Park and pick up a barbecue set for as little as \u00a324. With about 40 people maintaining strict 2m gaps, there was a long queue at B&amp;Q but no sign of a barbecue. \u201cWe\u2019ve come here to buy construction bits,\u201d explained translator Paula Soto, there with her partner Vijay Bakrania, who works in healthcare technology. They weren\u2019t much interested in grilling hamburgers for up to four friends. \u201cI don\u2019t think the R number is low enough to take a chance,\u201d said Soto, every bit the amateur epidemiologist that we have all learned to become. Forget the gastronomy, let\u2019s look at the virology, seemed to be the general message. Another customer who had no plans to buy or indeed hold a barbecue was Roy Olchik. He was underwhelmed by the new rules of social engagement. On the one hand he thought the continued social distancing provisions meant that there was little opportunity for \u201cfun as it used to be\u201d. \u201cIf we meet other families with our children and their children, how can you keep social distance?\u201d And on the other, he agreed with those members of Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory group, who have expressed reservations about relaxing the lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s frightening.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by several people in the queue. Only grandfather John Cook was excited about the new arrangement. He planned to hold a socially distanced party in his garden for his grandson\u2019s birthday on Thursday. \u201cIt will definitely lift the spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tended to suppress our feelings a little bit. We\u2019ve tried to be much more cheerful than we really are.\u201d But his improved spirits did not extend to the idea of the Johnsonian-endorsed barbecue. Perhaps fittingly for a B&amp;Q patron, he intended instead to go DIY. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a bring-your-own-food party,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich might get round some of the problems of sharing plates.\u201d If the retail park told a story of caution and anxiety, the actual parks provided a very different picture. Heat and sunshine does something to the British, and nowhere more conspicuously than in city parks. At the first sign of a heatwave we abandon social inhibitions, along with clothes and pretty much all definitions, however disputed, of common sense. As temperatures have hovered around the mid-20s in this most sublime of spring seasons, the parks have played host to some scenes that, in our current puritan climate, can seem positively Hogarthian. It\u2019s possible to see gatherings of 10 or more people honouring the 2m rule more in the breach than in the observance. It has been suggested that such transgressions have multiplied in the wake of the Dominic Cummings revelations, as people no longer see the point in adhering to rules they believe have been flouted by the prime minister\u2019s senior advisor. JJ, Mustafa and Jasmine, a trio I met in Queen\u2019s Park in north-west London, dismissed the idea that the Cummings saga had changed anyone\u2019s behaviour. \u201cI live by Highbury Fields,\u201d said JJ, who works in the music business, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen it as busy as in last few weeks, and that was pre-Cummings. I think he\u2019s a shaft but I also think the level of hysteria has been insane.\u201d It was the first time the three friends had met up since before the lockdown, and Mustafa, who is a doctor, was looking forward to the possibilities offered by the new rules. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he said with genuine enthusiasm, as though standing 2m away from five friends was an almost unimaginable level of social engagement. \u201cWe are social animals. To see someone in the flesh, in 3D, makes a huge difference,\u201d said JJ, sounding like the weary veteran of rather too many Zoom encounters. \u201cI don\u2019t even like these two,\u201d he went on, jokingly nodding towards the others, \u201cbut I\u2019m actually excited to see them today.\u201d Throughout the Covid-19 crisis the government has tended to be one or two steps behind the public mood.

      "body": "<p>The NHS Covid-19 alert app will be available nationwide in June. It\u2019s voluntary, so those of us with smartphones must decide: should we download the app?</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, thinks we should, claiming that we would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">doing our&nbsp;duty</a>&nbsp;and helping to&nbsp;save lives\u201d.</p> <p>If only it were that simple. Even if 80% of smartphone users (60% of the UK population) download the app, which is the adoption rate epidemiologists say is needed to make it work, the app won\u2019t save lives.</p> <p>Our first problem is that the UK\u2019s testing capability is too slow stop the spread of the virus. Once you\u2019re infected, you\u2019re contagious for two days before the onset of Covid-19 symptoms and most contagious on the first day of symptoms.</p> <p>To break the chain of transmission, you must alert your contacts within that narrow window of opportunity, so that they can quarantine for the 14-day incubation period and report if they too show symptoms and need testing. Yet many people struggle or are unable to get tested, and the average return time for a test result is five days \u2013 with the longest taking 13 days.</p> <p>If we could improve our testing capacity to meet the tight turnaround needed to alert people within the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d, and if we built an app that sent alerts based on a positive test result, then we might have something useful.</p> <p>However, the app we are being invited to download doesn\u2019t rely on a positive test result. Instead, it asks us to self-report symptoms. This introduces several pathways to failure.</p> <p>The app only asks if you have two out of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3\">14 Covid-19 symptoms</a> recognised by the World Health Organization: fever and continuous cough. This means it may fail to account for infected people who show the other symptoms \u2013 and thus will not alert their contacts.</p> <p>The app may not flag up people who don\u2019t have a fever, who account for about a third of positive cases. No self-reporting app will work for people who are infected but never show symptoms, which the US Centers for Disease Control estimates could amount to as many as 30% of cases. Only a test will detect those cases.</p> <p>Still, it can\u2019t do any harm to download the app, right? Actually, no. Unless the government compels employers to pay people to quarantine for 14 days every time they receive an alert, people may feel pressured to ignore the alerts and keep working, even if that risks their health and that of their contacts. Also, not every worker is entitled to sick pay. Those are policy problems, not an app problem, but if we don\u2019t solve them, the app won\u2019t work and the virus will continue to spread.</p> <p>The app also puts our data and privacy at greater risk of an accidental breach or a cyberattack because it is based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials\">centralised model</a>, which stores our data on a central server. A decentralised model, which keeps our data on our devices, minimises this risk. Most other countries have opted for a decentralised model for their app. There\u2019s still time for the UK to change course.</p> <p>Most worrying of all, the government has so far denied parliament the opportunity to pass primary legislation to protect and limit the use of our data relating to using the app.</p> <p>Without such legislation, we risk creating a new set of problems. For instance, do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine? Do we want our employers to be able to know our Covid-19 status, or to be able to pressure us to download this \u201cvoluntary\u201d app as a condition of returning to work?&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine, or employers to pressure us to download the app?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do we want private companies to access this data, the way they already access so much else? Can we request that our data be deleted after the pandemic or will the government retain it indefinitely, and use it however it wants? Will this app exist only for the duration of the pandemic, or could the government require it to be used as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/chinese-city-plans-to-turn-coronavirus-app-into-permanent-health-tracker\">permanent health tracker</a>, as is already being planned in the Chinese city of Hangzhou?</p> <p>The answers to these questions could change our lives and the balance of power between individuals, employers and the state. Parliament must therefore scrutinise all of this and, where necessary, legislate and specify oversight and enforcement mechanisms.</p> <p>A contact tracing app could play a useful role in our pandemic response, but only if we set it up to succeed, not fail. If we create an app that really could help save lives, and which we could use with confidence, there will be no need to ask us to download it out of a sense of duty.</p> <p>We\u2019ll want it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster</p>",

If we could improve our testing capacity to meet the tight turnaround needed to alert people within the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d, and if we built an app that sent alerts based on a positive test result, then we might have something useful. However, the app we are being invited to download doesn\u2019t rely on a positive test result. Instead, it asks us to self-report symptoms. This introduces several pathways to failure. The app only asks if you have two out of 14 Covid-19 symptoms recognised by the World Health Organization: fever and continuous cough. This means it may fail to account for infected people who show the other symptoms \u2013 and thus will not alert their contacts. The app may not flag up people who don\u2019t have a fever, who account for about a third of positive cases. No self-reporting app will work for people who are infected but never show symptoms, which the US Centers for Disease Control estimates could amount to as many as 30% of cases. Only a test will detect those cases. Still, it can\u2019t do any harm to download the app, right? Actually, no. Unless the government compels employers to pay people to quarantine for 14 days every time they receive an alert, people may feel pressured to ignore the alerts and keep working, even if that risks their health and that of their contacts. Also, not every worker is entitled to sick pay. Those are policy problems, not an app problem, but if we don\u2019t solve them, the app won\u2019t work and the virus will continue to spread. The app also puts our data and privacy at greater risk of an accidental breach or a cyberattack because it is based on a centralised model, which stores our data on a central server. A decentralised model, which keeps our data on our devices, minimises this risk. Most other countries have opted for a decentralised model for their app. There\u2019s still time for the UK to change course. Most worrying of all, the government has so far denied parliament the opportunity to pass primary legislation to protect and limit the use of our data relating to using the app. Without such legislation, we risk creating a new set of problems. For instance, do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine? Do we want our employers to be able to know our Covid-19 status, or to be able to pressure us to download this \u201cvoluntary\u201d app as a condition of returning to work? Do we want private companies to access this data, the way they already access so much else? Can we request that our data be deleted after the pandemic or will the government retain it indefinitely, and use it however it wants? Will this app exist only for the duration of the pandemic, or could the government require it to be used as a permanent health tracker, as is already being planned in the Chinese city of Hangzhou? The answers to these questions could change our lives and the balance of power between individuals, employers and the state. Parliament must therefore scrutinise all of this and, where necessary, legislate and specify oversight and enforcement mechanisms. A contact tracing app could play a useful role in our pandemic response, but only if we set it up to succeed, not fail. If we create an app that really could help save lives, and which we could use with confidence, there will be no need to ask us to download it out of a sense of duty. We\u2019ll want it. \u2022 Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster",

As for Trump, whose election owed much to social media, he now appears to be biting the hand that feeds him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the last thing Trump wants is to shut down Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moonalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Roger McNamee,</a> author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s completely dependent on them and, by the way, they on him. The symbiosis is complete.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I think what Twitter did relative to the looters and shooters tweet is actually very brave. It\u2019s also incredibly obvious and something they should\u2019ve done years ago, and something Facebook should do, because if you look at the public safety aspect of the terms of service, that tweet is an obvious violation and, coming from the president, it has enormous risk of causing public safety harm.\u201d</p> <p>McNamee, a co-founder of the private equity firm <a href=\"https://elevation.com/\">Elevation Partners</a> and an early investor in Facebook, Google and Amazon, added: \u201cThe fact that Facebook left it up speaks volumes about the different approaches of the two companies because how big do you think Twitter is without Trump? Is it half its current size? Is it less than that? This is a very brave thing for them to do.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of Twitter offers <a href=\"https://www.thefortyfifth.us/\">a real-time window on his consciousness</a> at all hours of day and night. Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">a baseless accusation of murder</a> levelled at a TV host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Charlie Sykes,</a> a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html\">it would backfire on him</a> because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d</p> <p>Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">turned out to have numerous exceptions,</a> the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress. Observers detected a blatant attempt to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which this week claimed its 100,000th life in America, and an outbreak of violence after the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis.</p> <p>Sykes, THE founder and editor-at-large of <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/\">the Bulwark website,</a> added: \u201cTo be attacking a private company because it factchecked him is a disturbing look, even for Trump. The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d</p> <p>Trump expressed anger last year after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\">Facebook banned seven users</a> including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them.</p> <p>Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote.</p> <p>Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7/0_175_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-twitter-followers/\">according to Brandwatch,</a> ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres. Then comes Trump in ninth place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler,</a> a political analyst, said: \u201cHe [Trump] needs Twitter because it\u2019s his vehicle to communicate with millions of people who follow him. I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/michael-dantonio\">Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio</a> describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along. He said of the current feud: \u201cI think it\u2019s about Twitter being his drug and Jack Dorsey threatening to limit his supply.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the effect of a drug on him, so the pleasure that he gets from tweeting and from the response to his tweet probably gives him a rush and I think even the thought of it being constrained is painful, probably physically painful in his own body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also him encountering someone who can hold him responsible and, as he makes clear, he\u2019s never responsible for anything, and that is enraging. It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d</p>",

Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including a baseless accusation of murder levelled at a TV host. Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, it would backfire on him because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but turned out to have numerous exceptions, the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite. It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress. Observers detected a blatant attempt to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which this week claimed its 100,000th life in America, and an outbreak of violence after the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis. Sykes, THE founder and editor-at-large of the Bulwark website, added: \u201cTo be attacking a private company because it factchecked him is a disturbing look, even for Trump. The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets. \u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d Trump expressed anger last year after Facebook banned seven users including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them. Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote. Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d \u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, according to Brandwatch, ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres. Then comes Trump in ninth place. Rick Tyler, a political analyst, said: \u201cHe [Trump] needs Twitter because it\u2019s his vehicle to communicate with millions of people who follow him. I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along. He said of the current feud: \u201cI think it\u2019s about Twitter being his drug and Jack Dorsey threatening to limit his supply. \u201cIt has the effect of a drug on him, so the pleasure that he gets from tweeting and from the response to his tweet probably gives him a rush and I think even the thought of it being constrained is painful, probably physically painful in his own body. \u201cIt\u2019s also him encountering someone who can hold him responsible and, as he makes clear, he\u2019s never responsible for anything, and that is enraging. It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d",

The BBC\u2019s restoration revealed a reference code on the metal, showing that it had held two sten submachine guns, 600 rounds and 12 grenades \u2013 weapons to harry the occupying German troops and ambush them when D-Day arrived.

      "bodyText": "The governor had promised Saturday would be different and it was. As the clock ticked toward the 8pm curfew in Minneapolis, Minnesota, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the fifth precinct police station in a particular show of defiance. The previous evening, they had refused to obey the curfew and when push came to shove it was the police who retreated. What followed \u2013 looting and burning along a two-mile stretch of Lake Street, a busy shopping thoroughfare \u2013 led the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, to mobilize the national guard and say there would be no repeat. Outside the fifth precinct station on Saturday, some protesters were certain that if they kept it peaceful they would be allowed to make their point. They were still demanding justice for George Floyd, who was killed by a member of the same Minneapolis police force they were now facing down. But not long after the curfew kicked in, any such illusions were quickly dispelled. A line of state police in riot gear appeared from a side street. A call for the protesters to disperse was swiftly followed by teargas, flash bombs and baton rounds. As the crowd surged away, the police moved rapidly forward in line, driving people back with more gas and rounds. It quickly became clear that after Walz was humiliated by the events of Friday night, he had no intention of being embarrassed again. The governor had laid the ground earlier in the day when he said the protests had been hijacked by \u201celements\u201d of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilization, making it politically easier to escalate the use of force. Whoever the protesters were, sympathy for their cause among many people in the area was tempered by anger over the destruction of locally owned businesses and fear that violence might spread to the streets where people lived. Residents of the surrounding blocks didn\u2019t wait for the police and organized their own security, throwing up makeshift barriers with bollards, roadworks signs and metal posts. Some carried guns. As the protesters fled the fifth precinct station, the police kept up pursuit. Some demonstrators tried to build barriers and make a stand but were overwhelmed. Eventually though, the scattered crowd came together again on Lake Street and several hundred people began to march its length, chanting George Floyd\u2019s name and calling for the arrest of other police officers involved in his death.

      "body": "<p>The lockdown has been tough for David Mkoswe, a mechanic who lives in Alexandra, a sprawling township on the north-eastern edges of Johannesburg. Since Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, restricted the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants to their homes in late March, Mkoswe only earns if he works, and any savings are quickly spent.</p> <p>For the last three weeks, there has been no money to buy milk for his nine-month-old daughter. \u201cMy little girl has been crying all the time,\u201d Mkoswe, 38, said yesterday.<br><br>But there has been another problem too. The strict lockdown imposed eight weeks ago included a prohibition on buying or transporting alcoholic drinks. \u201cWithin days, there was no more beer. Then there was no whisky,\u201d said Mkoswe, who struggles with alcoholism.<br><br>The lockdown is now almost over. On Monday, South Africa will move to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/how-lockdown-level-3-will-affect-business-in-south-africa-48651685\">level three</a>\u201d of five, allowing many more businesses and some public transport to function under strict conditions. Covid-19 has spread relatively slowly across Africa, where there are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-4a11d568-2716-41cf-a15e-7d15079548bc\">only 130,000 cases.</a> But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/27/how-south-africas-action-on-covid-19-contrasts-sharply-with-its-response-to-aids-coronavirus\">South Africa</a> is the worst hit country, with more than 27,000 of these, and scientists predict a surge over the coming months.<br><br>Zweli Mkhize, the health minister, said last week that the drastic restrictions had been effective at halting a rapidly spreading outbreak, but acknowledged the very high costs in a country where more than 50% of people <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ZAF/south-africa/poverty-rate\">live in poverty</a>. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold the lockdown for ever \u2026 There has to be relief of hunger and social distress,\u201d Mkhize told reporters.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f88b78cbc361ca48ad0e68037ab43a1edec483\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f88b78cbc361ca48ad0e68037ab43a1edec483/0_390_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South African police search a local bar in downtown Johannesburg in March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South African police search a local bar in downtown Johannesburg in March after sales of alcohol were banned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics describe the prohibition on alcohol imposed by Ramaphosa on 27 March as puritanical and arbitrary. From tomorrow, alcohol sales will be <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/coronavirus/arthro/south_africa_eases_bans_on_alcohol_sales_church_services-360533/\">allowed on four days a week</a>. No alcohol can be bought on Fridays and over the weekend, and it must be consumed only at home, with bars remaining closed.<br><br>South Africa has some of the highest levels of violent crime in the world, and more than half of murder victims have elevated levels of alcohol in their blood, experts say. Half of all murders take place on a Friday or Saturday night.<br><br>\u201cMurders have come down by 63% during the lockdown and that suggests that other violent crimes have gone down too,\u201d said Gareth Newham, head of the governance, crime and justice division at the Institute for Security Studies, a thinktank in Pretoria.<br><br>Traffic accidents \u2013 another major cause of deaths in South Africa \u2013 have also reduced in number significantly.<br><br>Overall, mortality rates have dropped since the first cases of Covid were detected in the country at the beginning of March, while hospitals have seen only a third of the usual number of <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/news/covid-19-ban-on-alcohol-sees-trauma-unit-numbers-significantly-lowered-say-healthworkers-46980267\">severe wounds and injuries</a>.<br><br>Cigarette sales were also initially banned, on the basis that smoking weakens the respiratory system and that in poorer areas people share cigarettes, possibly increasing the risk of spreading the virus.<br><br>But the prohibitions created a booming illicit trade, providing huge opportunities for organised criminals. Police have described an increase in smuggling of contraband into South Africa from its neighbours and a spate of burglaries of stores stocking alcohol.<br><br>South Africa has long had a problem of criminal gangs illegally selling cigarettes.

      "bodyText": "The lockdown has been tough for David Mkoswe, a mechanic who lives in Alexandra, a sprawling township on the north-eastern edges of Johannesburg. Since Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, restricted the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants to their homes in late March, Mkoswe only earns if he works, and any savings are quickly spent. For the last three weeks, there has been no money to buy milk for his nine-month-old daughter. \u201cMy little girl has been crying all the time,\u201d Mkoswe, 38, said yesterday. But there has been another problem too. The strict lockdown imposed eight weeks ago included a prohibition on buying or transporting alcoholic drinks. \u201cWithin days, there was no more beer. Then there was no whisky,\u201d said Mkoswe, who struggles with alcoholism. The lockdown is now almost over. On Monday, South Africa will move to \u201clevel three\u201d of five, allowing many more businesses and some public transport to function under strict conditions. Covid-19 has spread relatively slowly across Africa, where there are only 130,000 cases. But South Africa is the worst hit country, with more than 27,000 of these, and scientists predict a surge over the coming months. Zweli Mkhize, the health minister, said last week that the drastic restrictions had been effective at halting a rapidly spreading outbreak, but acknowledged the very high costs in a country where more than 50% of people live in poverty. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold the lockdown for ever \u2026 There has to be relief of hunger and social distress,\u201d Mkhize told reporters. Critics describe the prohibition on alcohol imposed by Ramaphosa on 27 March as puritanical and arbitrary. From tomorrow, alcohol sales will be allowed on four days a week. No alcohol can be bought on Fridays and over the weekend, and it must be consumed only at home, with bars remaining closed. South Africa has some of the highest levels of violent crime in the world, and more than half of murder victims have elevated levels of alcohol in their blood, experts say. Half of all murders take place on a Friday or Saturday night. \u201cMurders have come down by 63% during the lockdown and that suggests that other violent crimes have gone down too,\u201d said Gareth Newham, head of the governance, crime and justice division at the Institute for Security Studies, a thinktank in Pretoria. Traffic accidents \u2013 another major cause of deaths in South Africa \u2013 have also reduced in number significantly. Overall, mortality rates have dropped since the first cases of Covid were detected in the country at the beginning of March, while hospitals have seen only a third of the usual number of severe wounds and injuries. Cigarette sales were also initially banned, on the basis that smoking weakens the respiratory system and that in poorer areas people share cigarettes, possibly increasing the risk of spreading the virus. But the prohibitions created a booming illicit trade, providing huge opportunities for organised criminals. Police have described an increase in smuggling of contraband into South Africa from its neighbours and a spate of burglaries of stores stocking alcohol. South Africa has long had a problem of criminal gangs illegally selling cigarettes. Networks which already sold narcotics have now added alcohol to the illegal goods they offer their customers. \u201cThis has given a massive boost to organised crime. Demand has remained the same, but the supply side has simply shifted into the control of the illicit industry. It is going to be very difficult to roll back,\u201d said Newham. While criminals have thrived, South Africa\u2019s thousands of bars and restaurants have sustained massive losses, threatening huge numbers of jobs in a country already suffering high unemployment and a flagging economy. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to be feeling the pain \u2026 it\u2019s been very, very, very hard,\u201d said Tobogo Phiri, who shut his popular venue in Soweto when the lockdown was imposed. South African pubs and bars will remain closed until further notice, along with hotels, game lodges and restaurants, although the government has said it is committed to progressively lifting restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s no bad thing that the pubs are shut,\u201d Mkoswe said. \u201cIt\u2019s much safer to drink at home. I don\u2019t know what Monday will bring but I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be having a party.\u201d",

The approval of the new guidelines paves the way for the UK\u2019s film and high-end television production industry, which includes series that cost \u00a31m-plus per episode, to get cameras rolling again \u2013 potentially as soon as July. The resumption of production, which ground to a halt in the face of the spread of the coronavirus, will be warmly welcomed by broadcasters, streaming services and cinema owners facing a possible future content drought. It will also be welcome news to tens of thousands of self-employed freelance film and TV workers, from directors and camera operators to prop makers and makeup artists, who have been ineligible for government financial support and struggling to make ends meet. The guidelines, drawn up by the British Film Commission and the British Film Institute, include rules on physical distancing, safety training and temperature tests. The document has been signed off by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive. However, it will still be up to each individual production to decide how, and when, to restart filming.

      "body": "<p>Police&nbsp;across swathes of Africa&nbsp;have failed to find more than a fraction of&nbsp;hundreds of people who&nbsp;have escaped from often unsanitary and uncomfortable&nbsp;Covid-19 quarantine centres&nbsp;in recent weeks.</p> <p>There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, but low levels of testing means the true total is likely to be much higher.</p> <p>In Malawi, more than 400 people repatriated from South Africa and elsewhere fled a makeshift centre set up at a stadium in Blantyre, the commercial capital, last week. Police and health workers told reporters they were unable to stop the escapees as they lacked adequate protective gear.</p> <p>At least 46 escapees had tested positive for the virus, officials said. Some of those who fled told reporters they had bribed police. In separate incidents 26 people left the Mwanza border post while waiting for test results and eight others, all tested and shown to be infected, broke out of an isolation centre in Blantyre.</p> <p>In Zimbabwe, Paul Nyathi,&nbsp;a police spokesman, said a total of 148 people had escaped from centres where a 21-day quarantine is mandatory for those returning from abroad.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cSecurity has been beefed up at the quarantine centres and measures are being taken to repair porous dura walls and security fences at some of the facilities,\u201d Nyathi said.</p> <p>There has also been at least one mass breakout in Kenya, while individuals have also escaped from quarantine in&nbsp;Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, <a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Truck-drivers-with-Covid-19-escape/1066-5563964-rfy9ydz/index.html\">Uganda&nbsp;</a>and <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/202005250631.html\">Namibia</a>.</p> <p>Zimbabwe\u2019s information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, told reporters earlier this month that the government is increasing security at the schools, colleges and hotels used as quarantine centres.

      "bodyText": "Police across swathes of Africa have failed to find more than a fraction of hundreds of people who have escaped from often unsanitary and uncomfortable Covid-19 quarantine centres in recent weeks. There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, but low levels of testing means the true total is likely to be much higher. In Malawi, more than 400 people repatriated from South Africa and elsewhere fled a makeshift centre set up at a stadium in Blantyre, the commercial capital, last week. Police and health workers told reporters they were unable to stop the escapees as they lacked adequate protective gear. At least 46 escapees had tested positive for the virus, officials said. Some of those who fled told reporters they had bribed police. In separate incidents 26 people left the Mwanza border post while waiting for test results and eight others, all tested and shown to be infected, broke out of an isolation centre in Blantyre. In Zimbabwe, Paul Nyathi, a police spokesman, said a total of 148 people had escaped from centres where a 21-day quarantine is mandatory for those returning from abroad. \u201cSecurity has been beefed up at the quarantine centres and measures are being taken to repair porous dura walls and security fences at some of the facilities,\u201d Nyathi said. There has also been at least one mass breakout in Kenya, while individuals have also escaped from quarantine in Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda and Namibia. Zimbabwe\u2019s information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, told reporters earlier this month that the government is increasing security at the schools, colleges and hotels used as quarantine centres. Government spokesman Nick Mangwana suggested that security officers guarding centres with high walls and razor wire might be receiving bribes to allow people to leave early. Nearly all of Zimbabwe\u2019s 75 new coronavirus cases last week came from centres that hold hundreds of people who have returned, sometimes involuntarily, from neighbouring South Africa and Botswana. There have been widespread complaints about conditions in the quarantine centres, but the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said the returnees should not expect luxury. \u201cWe can try to provide for them, but we cannot provide five-star facilities like hotels,\u201d Mnangagwa said on Thursday. Norman Matara, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, told the Guardian it was impossible to observe social distancing in the centres, which posed a significant risk to those held in them and to the country as a whole. \u201cIt is disturbing. It may show that people are being infected in quarantine centres. So people should not share things like amenities and do not eat in overcrowded dining rooms,\u201d Matara said. South Africa, a developed economy which attracts migrant workers from across the region, has more than 27,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 \u2013 the most in Africa. There are fears that the outbreak there could spread across southern Africa, where health systems are considerably less able to cope. Zimbabwe\u2019s government is also worried about people crossing porous borders illegally. The information ministry has set up a hotline number and is asking people to stop harbouring \u201cborder jumpers\u201d and those who \u201cabscond\u201d from quarantine. The busy border with South Africa was shut in March but there are close to 200 illegal crossing points used by traffickers to obtain basic goods that are unavailable or unaffordable in Zimbabwe. Earlier this month, 41 Malawian immigrants were picked up by police after skipping the border from South Africa through the Limpopo River. Nine are being kept at a quarantine centre at the Beitbridge border point after they tested positive for Covid-19. Sean Muguti, a freight clearing agent at Beitbridge, said smugglers were working with truckers: \u201cIt is a battle for survival \u2026 They will always find ways to beat the system.\u201d South Africa has been able to provide relatively comfortable quarantine facilities when necessary, hosting one group of nationals returning from China in a tourist lodge in the province of Limpopo. But elsewhere centres are often unsanitary, uncomfortable and in some cases dangerous, human rights campaigners say. In Kenya, investigations by Human Rights Watch revealed poor conditions, including lack of bedding, water, food, and cleaning supplies. People held in quarantine facilities told HRW they were not told of test results and that staff did not wear protective equipment. A 22-year-old man who was quarantined following his arrival from France on 23 March told the organisation that his centre had lacked electricity, bathing water, food and water to drink. \u201cThe beds had no mattresses or beddings. I slept on the spring bed with no mattress and nothing to cover myself. They told me I had to pay for water,\u201d he said. Many others described similar conditions in other facilities and said the authorities sometimes extended quarantine periods from the initial mandatory 14 days to more than 30 days, even when people tested negative several times. All were asked to pay for accommodation, food and other costs before being allowed to leave. Many of those who could not pay were held for additional days and in one instance police were called in to beat those who persisted in pleading their inability to pay, victims and witnesses said.",

      "body": "<p>There was a moment, in early lockdown, when everything \u201clive\u201d seemed to stop. No gigs, no plays, no clubs, no classes, no festivals. Nothing happening right now, no moments that brought you closer to strangers, nothing spontaneous and fun and immediate.</p> <p>Nothing, except radio. Radio gives us, as it always has, a constantly live event, familiar but ever changing. Whether you\u2019re a news junkie, a music fiend, or you just like silly chat, there are stations for you. There are phone-ins if you want to vent, pop quizzes for distraction, sing-alongs, help with schoolwork. Plus, if you find a show you like, a DJ can become a replacement friend \u2013 a warm presence chuntering in the kitchen corner, cracking quips over your headphones, blasting tunes out of speakers you\u2019ve put on the window ledge.</p> <p>As a medium, radio responded quickly to the coronavirus pandemic. Time slots were shifted and simplified: Radio 2 and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music\">6 Music</a> changed their schedules to reflect the lack of a school run or commute. Special shows popped up: comedy slots on <a href=\"https://www.unionjack.co.uk/\">UnionJACK</a>, an altered Drive on 5Live; <a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/\">Fun Kids</a> expanded its home school offering. And listeners liked it. Ratings have soared. Recent <a href=\"https://www.rajar.co.uk/content.php?page=listen_market_trends\">Rajars</a> (the official radio listening figures), which cover the weeks immediately following lockdown, saw increases for 6 Music\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c000j\">Lauren Laverne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080x5m\">Radio 1\u2019s Greg James</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.heart.co.uk/radio/shows-presenters/heart-breakfast-jamie-theakston-amanda-holden/\">Heart\u2019s Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden</a>. Local commercial stations saw digital listening increase by around 40%, with some up 75%; LBC, which talks virus nonstop, has seen its daily online reach grow 43%. (Music streaming has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/17/everyones-stuck-at-home-so-why-are-people-streaming-less-music-lady-gaga-dua-lipa\">gone down</a> since the pandemic started.) </p> <p>Some shows have blossomed during lockdown. Some have been born: NoSignal\u2019s live soundclash show <em>10v10</em> has exploded into success, with hundreds of thousands tuning in worldwide to hear Vybz Kartel tracks played&nbsp;in competition against Wizkid\u2019s, or Ian Wright clash with Julie Adenuga with 80s v 90s tunes. The excitement across social media, the fun and good vibes\u2026 these are live events, and we can all join in, all feel connected, even though we\u2019re stuck at home.

Less is said about her breakfast gig, which has created a similar, intimate space since Laverne took it over in early 2019. \u201cI like to think of the show as making a new mixtape for a friend every day,\u201d she says, which says a lot about her appeal.</p> <p>The programme is pitched as an adventurous show of musical discovery, in which Laverne plays forgotten classics, obscurities and new releases. More often than not she starts with an unexpected, spirit-raising banger, such as Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Everyday People or LCD Soundsystem\u2019s All My Friends. But it\u2019s her warm style and inclusive personality that have kept her listeners locked in and that seems particularly well suited to the current times. It\u2019s clear that she thinks a lot about radio\u2019s role in people\u2019s lives. \u201cWhen something dramatic happens in a film or TV, like a big world event, the scene will cut, and you\u2019ll hear someone speaking to you from a radio,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be an old grand dame in the media, but in these situations, it\u2019s what people turn to. Radio\u2019s what we should do well.\u201d</p> <p>In early March, as listeners\u2019 messages started to flood her inbox and Twitter feed, Laverne realised she had to respond to the pandemic and cancelled plans to take a fortnight off: \u201cIt felt right to do that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t ignore what is happening. We just try to provide the right emotional cushion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>6 Music DJs were possibly better prepared for the situation, Laverne says, because of their experience responding to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/15/how-radio-reacted-to-bowie-people-come-and-join-you-thats-the-way-it-should-be\">emotional reactions of their listeners</a> after David Bowie\u2019s and Prince\u2019s sudden deaths in 2016. \u201cThose were huge moments of collective grief that we had to work out literally live on air. We turned up for work, put our shows in the bin, and realised we had to talk about how people felt. That was very new for us.\u201d</p> <p>In the early days of lockdown, her mood and her music choices were more gentle and calming, but as time moved on, she recognised that our pandemic experiences weren\u2019t just about one emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re sitting in a car going to a funeral, broken-hearted, then someone tells a funny story and you\u2019re all in hysterics. You need different things. Sometimes people want a moment of escape, a kitchen disco, and that\u2019s not necessarily about euphoria. It\u2019s often about catharsis.\u201d</p> <p>Finding music that was hopeful but not chirpy became Laverne\u2019s goal. I mention her playing Coldcut and Lisa Stansfield\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IoWjow6xDs\">People Hold On</a> around the peak of the epidemic, and how perfect that felt. She nearly leaps off the bed. \u201cOh God, yes! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever played that before, but that was quite a moment.\u201d She\u2019s also been reminded how much great music comes out of struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s there in every genre: rock\u2019n\u2019roll, soul, disco, everything. Music can give us such support.\u201d</p> <p>Listener interaction is a big part of the show \u2013 Laverne alternates between asking her listeners \u201cbig emotional questions\u201d and having \u201cdaft, fun moments\u201d. She mentions a recent \u201clockdown hair\u201d slot, and a picture she\u2019d been sent of a father who\u2019d given both sides of his hair for different children to cut (\u201cI was in stitches\u201d). She also gets sent pictures every day from a listener of his elderly mum. \u201cShe\u2019s 89, she\u2019s self-isolating, called Annelise, and there she is on a Tuesday, waving to me in an amazing hat!\u201d Laverne doesn\u2019t seem to think this is peculiar at all: quite the contrary. \u201cThat\u2019s the really nice thing about the job. You\u2019re a part of people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>She has also heard from listeners who have come to the show for the first time, and more families listening. Does she think people want an escape from the news? \u201cI don\u2019t think they necessarily want an alternative \u2013 they want a counterpoint. We don\u2019t ignore what is happening. We just try to provide the right emotional cushion.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing illustrates this better than the slot every Thursday that the show dedicates to different key workers. These have included groups rarely celebrated in the media: charity fundraisers; delivery drivers; shop workers. Many have got in touch to thank her for remembering them, which has moved her profoundly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting there in your little studio you\u2019re quite sequestered from the world, but your voice is reaching out to places you can\u2019t even imagine. And to think of those people wiping the trolleys, putting the bread on the shelves, messaging you to say thank you for thanking them\u2026 it reminds you what public service broadcasting is here for.\u201d</p> <p>Laverne knows live radio can do this like nothing else can. \u201cIt\u2019s one person broadcasting to one another person, and that intimacy, but it\u2019s also community. And to be doing it at breakfast time, and getting people up to face the day\u2026\u201d She laughs. \u201cWell, above all, you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re playing the right tunes.\u201d <strong>JR</strong></p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your live radio hero?<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/09/vanessa-feltz-nickname-vanessa-the-undresser-preserve-your-mystique-at-all-costs\">Vanessa Feltz</a> on BBC London is in a league of her own.

Well, in a crisis like this, it genuinely isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Dale has been a fixture on LBC, Britain\u2019s biggest commercial news talk station, since 2010 \u2013 he presides over the 7-10pm slot from Monday to Thursday. Far from impartial, the 57-year-old stood as the Tory candidate in North Norfolk in the 2005 general election and, though he later quit active politics, is closer aligned to stablemates Nick Ferrari and Nigel Farage than the left-leaning, Brexit-despairing James O\u2019Brien.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Friends say I sound much more personal and intimate since I've been doing this at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Dale has a soft side too. \u201cOne of the first things I learned when I joined LBC was: open up about yourself, make sure that people can relate to you,\u201d he says, down the line from his house in Tunbridge Wells. \u201cSo my audience knows that I support West Ham, that I drive an Audi, that I have a jack russell and a miniature schnauzer, and that means that when they phone in on an emotional topic, especially if it\u2019s to do with coronavirus, they will talk to you in a way that they just wouldn\u2019t if they were being interviewed on television. It makes it so much more intimate and powerful.\u201d</p> <p>That intimacy has only increased since Dale, who has type 2 diabetes and is therefore at high risk during the pandemic, stopped coming into LBC\u2019s Leicester Square studios in mid-March. \u201cI\u2019m literally broadcasting from my bedroom,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only room in the house with a carpet, so it sucks up the echoes. The duvet, the quilted headboard, the curtains \u2013 they all make it much more of a studio sound. It\u2019s a bit like that <em>Midnight Caller </em>TV programme: you really have got this one-to-one feel. I\u2019ve had a couple of friends say: \u2018You\u2019ve changed since you\u2019ve been doing this at home, you\u2019re sounding much more personal and intimate.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dale has had some extraordinarily raw on-air encounters since the pandemic struck. \u201cI had a guy phone in the middle of April saying: \u2018I\u2019ve called you because my mother died of coronavirus two hours ago.\u2019 Your instant thought is, why on earth would you phone a radio station two hours after your mother died? The reason was that he wanted people to obey the government\u2019s instructions, because he hadn\u2019t \u2013 he had gone to visit his mother and now he thought he\u2019d passed on the virus to her and basically killed her. Imagine having that weight on your mind.\u201d</p> <p>The man then phoned again to say he now had the virus himself, and a third time to say that he\u2019d recovered. \u201cOne of the things that the audience like, when a caller has a powerful story to tell, is to hear the follow-up,\u201d says Dale.</p> <p>Politics is still a central part of the show, and Dale points out that his leanings don\u2019t stop him from grilling government ministers over its response to the pandemic and the economic fallout. (He gave minister for London Paul Scully a hard time earlier this month about public transport fare increases, and is critical of Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown trips, tweeting that two of his friends used Cummings\u2019 actions as a justification for rule-bending behaviour of their own.) But it\u2019s his dialogue with listeners that really resonates. When I ask if he considers his show a release valve for the 563,000 people tuning in every week \u2013 LBC says digital listening hours to the show were up by 44% in April compared to February \u2013 Dale replies: \u201cI think this is ultimately public service broadcasting. People think of commercial radio as just commercial, but it isn\u2019t: you are providing a social service in times like this.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the technical challenges of broadcasting from home, it\u2019s worked very well so far, he says. During the show Dale has two laptops on the go, one to communicate with his producers and another to monitor incoming calls. His audio, captured on the \u201creally good\u201d microphone he uses to record his <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/iain-dale/for-the-many-subscribe-lbc-brand-new-podcast-now/\">For the Many podcast with Jacqui Smith</a>, is zapped back to Leicester Square with the help of a Mediaport router. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had to go to pre-prepared tape twice in around 50 programmes, which isn\u2019t a bad ratio,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Would he like to continue working from home after lockdown? He does enjoy the lifestyle, he admits \u2013 his husband, John, is at home, and he can walk the dogs every day. But if he\u2019s interviewing a politician, \u201cI like to have the politician in front of me, I like to see the whites of their eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was just doing three hours of straight phone-in, then yes, I could [do it from home]. But, no,\u201d he concludes, with a hint of regret: \u201cI couldn\u2019t do my normal radio show like this all the time.\u201d <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your live radio hero?<br></strong>Brian Hayes, the Australian presenter who was on LBC, BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio 2. I learned a hell of a lot from him, almost subconsciously, about how to keep an audience engaged and how to talk to people \u2013 if you\u2019re going to be quite acerbic, do it in a way that people don\u2019t think is gratuitously rude.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your funniest live radio moment?<br></strong>Five or six years ago, we were doing a discussion on homosexuality and I took a call from Margaret in Glasgow. She was going on about how gay people were sinners and they all had to be shot. At one point I said: \u201cMargaret, can I just stop you there, before you dig your hole even deeper, and tell you that you\u2019re talking to one.\u201d The phone line went silent for about three seconds, which in radio feels like 10. And she said: \u201cOh I didn\u2019t mean you, Iain.\u201d I hope that when she put the phone down, she did some rethinking.</p> <h2>Scully and Henrie Kwushue: \u2018We\u2019re definitely on to something here\u2019</h2> <p><em>Presenters of No Signal 10v10 soundclashes, <a href=\"https://www.theresnosignal.com/\">theresnosignal.com</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b87ae01cb93dcf2cf42fcf95df2d7021bf624674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b87ae01cb93dcf2cf42fcf95df2d7021bf624674/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henrie Kwushue and Scully, outside their houses in, respectively, Peckham, and Croydon, south London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henrie Kwushue and Scully, outside their houses in, respectively, Peckham, and Croydon, south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three months ago, no one had heard of No Signal, now a London-based online radio station with a heaving Twitter base and raucously innovative music shows \u2013 for the simple reason that it didn\u2019t exist. Launched in late March by brothers Jojo and David Sonubi, it has made creative use of the fact that its target audience is stuck at home thirsting for social engagement, with screens and speakers at their disposal.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I realised we were making a connection beyond our immediate friends group was Nicki Minaj vs Lil Kim,\u201d says Jason Kavuma, AKA Scully, a host of the station\u2019s breakout show, <em>10v10</em>, which pits two artists\u2019 songs against each other, culminating in a public vote on Twitter. \u201cPrior to that we were getting a couple of hundred listeners. Then several thousand people locked in. A lot of Nicki Minaj fans started voting and it was like: \u2018Oh, this could actually be big.\u2019 Then we featured [UK rappers] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/23/j-hus-big-conspiracy-album-review\">J Hus</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/06/kojo-funds-review-afro-swinger-grime-rap-trap-electric-brixton\">Kojo Funds</a>\u2026\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were trending No 1 on UK Twitter.

When we were checking the hashtag #NS10v10, it was no longer just friends of friends. It was random people I\u2019d never heard of coming in and making their opinion known.\u201d It got bigger still when more than a million tuned into <a href=\"http://grmdaily.com/ns10v10-vybz-kartel-vs-wizkid\">Vybz Kartel v Wizkid</a> on 3 May.</p> <p>Adept, charismatic hosts who maintain a lively pace over 90 minutes, Kavuma, 26, and Kwushue, 25, both got their start on the youth-led radio station <a href=\"https://www.reprezent.org.uk/\">Reprezent</a> in Brixton. They learned about production as well as presenting \u2013 Kavuma went on to work as an assistant producer at the BBC \u2013 though in both cases it was obvious that they thrived in front of a microphone. When the Sonubi brothers, who run the popular <a href=\"https://www.theresnosignal.com/\">Recess</a> club nights in south London, were seeking hosts for their new lockdown radio project, Kavuma and Kwushue were obvious choices.</p> <p>On <em>10v10</em>, which airs at 9pm on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays (this evening\u2019s battle is between UK and international drill music), each artist or subgenre is represented by a champion who selects 10 tracks and agitates on their behalf. Kwushue describes it as a gameshow rather than a soundclash \u2013 a judgment less on the quality of the artist than how convincingly they are represented. If the show is a little rough and ready at times \u2013 the participants communicate via Google Hangouts and the resulting audio is streamed to a radio server \u2013 it is more than compensated for by the exuberance of the presenters and the sheer fun they have with their audience on social media.</p> <p>That audience has grown to include the artists themselves. When Nigerian singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/28/burna-boy-african-giant-review\">Burna Boy</a> was matched against dancehall artist Popcaan, both megastars tuned in and stirred up their followers. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is crazy,\u2019\u201d says Kavuma. \u201c\u2018Two artists that I\u2019m a massive fan of are locking into me talking to other fans of their music from, like, this boxy bedroom. We\u2019re definitely on to something here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Their whirlwind success is testament to the freedom and immediacy of online radio \u2013 anyone with a bit of tech knowhow can do it, and fast \u2013 but you still need skill and sharp ideas. The genius of <em>10v10</em>, according to Kwushue, is combining a communal, live radio event with the instant kick of social media. \u201cPeople love sitting down together, watching each other\u2019s tweets and getting involved in the conversation,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think this is a really new and innovative way to do it.\u201d <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your live radio hero?<br>Kavuma:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkth\">Zane Lowe</a>. I like that he gets to play a combination of everything that he finds amazing. As someone with eclectic musical tastes, that\u2019s always inspired me.<br><strong>Kwushue:</strong> It\u2019s a toss-up between <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071stt\">MistaJam</a> [1Xtra] and <a href=\"http://www.julieadenuga.com/\">Julie Adenuga</a> [Beats 1].

We\u2019d see the ticket warden downstairs and I\u2019d be like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to a song real quick,\u201d and cut to the song while the artist ran downstairs to plead with the warden.<br><strong>Kwushue:</strong> I have a feature on my Reprezent show called Sing the Scenario.

Because he doesn\u2019t need to use public transport, he is one of the few BBC radio presenters still able to go into the studio. In some ways it is spooky: \u201cI\u2019m getting out of the lift, and wandering down empty corridors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know how lucky I am that my life hasn\u2019t changed very much, although it\u2019s very odd to get here walking on such silent streets. But you should see the way the light falls on Regent Street first thing in the morning. It makes you feel very lucky.\u201d</p> <p>Trelawny\u2019s warm, gentle style, and his commitment to his listeners, have helped his show come into its own during lockdown. His audience has been telling him the show is \u201ca lifeline\u201d, he says. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018There\u2019s something very reassuring about the new day starting with this familiar voice. I hear you, and this lovely music, and I know we\u2019ve got through the night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Classical music radio listening was already rising before the pandemic: in February 2020, Radio 3 posted its highest audience ratings in years, at 2.13 million listeners. And perhaps it is no surprise that many people are preferring Beethoven and Brahms at breakfast to the unrelenting news cycle (<em>Breakfast</em> now has only one bulletin, midway through the show).</p> <p>Trelawny has noticed his audience broadening, with an increase of messages over social media and email; parents and children, who would have otherwise been in work or in school, are listening, as are families far away from each other, who tune in together. He mentions one 87-year-old self-isolating far from her daughter, who requested a special birthday song for her mother \u2013 a memorable moment. \u201cThese loved ones are three or three hundred miles away from each other, but they\u2019re sharing the experience. That\u2019s very moving,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just about sharing this lovely, private moment. It\u2019s been oddly profound</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trelawny has worked hard to strike the right tone. \u201cI realised early on that there\u2019s no need to be going: \u2018This is a national emergency!\u2019 Everyone knows that. There\u2019s a grave danger in being too portentous.\u201d Often, he lets his music choices speak for him. He has been playing Schubert songs about the importance of working through our relationships, and others about the value of life, or the beauty of the countryside. A recent series of compositions about bluebells was particularly popular. \u201cThere\u2019s a sadness and grief there, of course, but we will be back in the bluebell woods again.\u201d<br><br>He has also added new, more rousing segments such as March of the Day (\u201cwhich came after a silly conversation with my producer about people missing <em>Match </em><em>of </em><em>the Day</em>\u201d) and the show\u2019s Friday sing-along, which has featured Scarborough Fair and A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square. The tunes are first played during the week so listeners can practise, but Trelawny has been at pains for this not to be a public, shared experience. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the lovely familiarity of sharing a song in strange, unfamiliar times. This is not about tweeting videos of yourself. You could be an out-of-work operatic tenor or someone who is literally embarrassed by their singing voice at a wedding \u2013 it\u2019s just about sharing this lovely, private moment. It\u2019s been oddly profound.\u201d</p> <p>Trelawny regularly recommends online performances that his listeners may want to access and recently played a series of songs inspired by museums around the country, which are in need of support.

A regular presenter on the central London online station, who has increased her output fivefold during the pandemic, Lynch was midway through her hour-long breakfast programme when disaster struck. \u201cMy sound desk literally went up in smoke,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt just completely cut out.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch, who has lived in Soho for 20 years, was broadcasting from her flat on Brewer Street, where she\u2019d cobbled together a home studio. After lockdown began on 23 March, she had grabbed a sound card from the now-empty radio station, procured a studio-quality microphone from eBay and covered her bedroom with sound-absorbing fabric and egg trays from the local dairy. She already had a sound desk from working on podcasts \u2013 Lynch produced the art series <em><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5014385\">Sculpting Lives</a></em> \u2013 and by the end of March she was operational, connecting with guests via Zoom and <a href=\"https://zencastr.com/\">Zencastr</a> and with listeners via Twitter and Instagram.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When my sound desk blew up, a listener down the street got a spare to me within the hour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sound desk packing in felt like a catastrophe, but help wasn\u2019t far away. \u201cOne of my listeners, who lives on the other end of my street, messaged me on Twitter even before the show had ended, saying: \u2018I have a spare sound desk, do you want me to loan it to you?\u2019 Within an hour, the box was outside my door and next morning I was up and running again. It was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>For Lynch, this gesture underlines the strength of community in Soho, a part of London that people don\u2019t often think of as residential. Normally thronging with shoppers and revellers, the area had fallen disconcertingly quiet since lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s very absent and strange \u2013 I\u2019m still not really used to it,\u201d she says. But as she has reached out to the neighbourhood through her show, the other residents \u2013 \u201cwe have around 3,000 people living here\u201d \u2013 have been tuning in and displaying their appreciation.</p> <p>Local radio has played a vital role in the pandemic, unearthing inspiring tales and forging connections in a crisis. The story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/beacon-of-light-capt-tom-moore-to-be-knighted\">Captain Tom Moore</a>, who raised more than \u00a330m by walking around his garden before his 100th birthday, came to us through BBC Three Counties Radio, while BBC Radio Devon helped connect a frontline NHS worker whose car had broken down with a mechanic who rode to her rescue.</p> <p><em>The Soho Hour</em> takes a similar approach. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be extremely local in one sense,\u201d says Lynch. Her guests \u2013 she has three on each morning \u2013 have included the local MP, the headteacher of Soho\u2019s primary school, and a lawyer from a nearby practice, attempting to clarify the government\u2019s lockdown guidance. She encourages local traders to send in homemade ads informing customers about opening hours and delivery services. Meanwhile, listeners get in touch to share information on where to buy bedding plants or find the nearest functioning post office. Lynch reads out obituaries, of which there have been a distressing number lately, but also celebrates births, birthdays and other happier occasions.</p> <p>The focus may be local but the appeal of the show, like that of the neighbourhood it represents, is much broader. \u201cSo many people think of Soho as home, even if it\u2019s not where they actually live, and the show is speaking to them as well.\u201d You may not be able to go to <a href=\"http://baritaliasoho.co.uk/\">Bar Italia</a>, or Gerry\u2019s Club, or <a href=\"http://www.frenchhousesoho.com/\">the French House</a>, but by interviewing their owners and staff, Lynch has been able to give listeners a connection to the landmarks they love.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a way for people to hear each other,\u201d she says. \u201cLocal radio brings a sense of community that has gotten lost in recent years. People are reconnecting with their local community under lockdown, and radio is the perfect entry point.\u201d <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><strong>Which radio presenters are seeing you through the pandemic?<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00llg30/episodes/player\">Cerys Matthews on BBC 6 Music</a> for a whole world of music and sound, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1rtmf0y9DWkzm3Pwb0cHP2g/jane-garvey\">Jane Garvey on BBC Radio 4 </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1rtmf0y9DWkzm3Pwb0cHP2g/jane-garvey\">Woman\u2019s Hour</a></em> for Covid-related news. </p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your live radio hero?<br></strong>I grew up listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/27/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">John Peel</a> in my bedroom.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment, in early lockdown, when everything \u201clive\u201d seemed to stop. No gigs, no plays, no clubs, no classes, no festivals. Nothing happening right now, no moments that brought you closer to strangers, nothing spontaneous and fun and immediate. Nothing, except radio. Radio gives us, as it always has, a constantly live event, familiar but ever changing. Whether you\u2019re a news junkie, a music fiend, or you just like silly chat, there are stations for you. There are phone-ins if you want to vent, pop quizzes for distraction, sing-alongs, help with schoolwork. Plus, if you find a show you like, a DJ can become a replacement friend \u2013 a warm presence chuntering in the kitchen corner, cracking quips over your headphones, blasting tunes out of speakers you\u2019ve put on the window ledge. As a medium, radio responded quickly to the coronavirus pandemic. Time slots were shifted and simplified: Radio 2 and 6 Music changed their schedules to reflect the lack of a school run or commute. Special shows popped up: comedy slots on UnionJACK, an altered Drive on 5Live; Fun Kids expanded its home school offering. And listeners liked it. Ratings have soared. Recent Rajars (the official radio listening figures), which cover the weeks immediately following lockdown, saw increases for 6 Music\u2019s Lauren Laverne, Radio 1\u2019s Greg James, and Heart\u2019s Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden. Local commercial stations saw digital listening increase by around 40%, with some up 75%; LBC, which talks virus nonstop, has seen its daily online reach grow 43%. (Music streaming has gone down since the pandemic started.) Some shows have blossomed during lockdown. Some have been born: NoSignal\u2019s live soundclash show 10v10 has exploded into success, with hundreds of thousands tuning in worldwide to hear Vybz Kartel tracks played in competition against Wizkid\u2019s, or Ian Wright clash with Julie Adenuga with 80s v 90s tunes. The excitement across social media, the fun and good vibes\u2026 these are live events, and we can all join in, all feel connected, even though we\u2019re stuck at home. Good times, happening in the moment, open to all. Perfect radio. Miranda Sawyer Lauren Laverne: \u2018Sometimes what you need is a kitchen disco\u2019 Presenter of BBC 6 Music\u2019s breakfast show (weekdays, 8.30am-midday) Earlier this month, the first set of Rajar figures for 2020 showed a record-breaking audience for Lauren Laverne\u2019s 6 Music weekday breakfast show: 1.3 million listeners from January to the end of March 2020, which included the early days of lockdown. \u201cWhen people say you\u2019re getting it right, it feels like a massive thing,\u201d she says, when we speak via Zoom on a weekday afternoon. Laverne is warm and relaxed: she\u2019s on her bed at home, wearing glasses, shirt and dungarees, chatting in between sending emails to sort out guests and running orders for future programmes. She is still presenting from the studio, but her team is split up (she\u2019s in one room behind glass, a producer in another, with other people working remotely). In the early days of lockdown, she walked the six miles home every day to decompress, \u201cbut that quickly got knackering. Now my family drive me in and pick me up, bless them.\u201d This involves her husband, Graham Fisher, bundling two sons, Fergus and Mack, into the car before 7am (\u201cSome days it\u2019s easier than others,\u201d she laughs). Much has been written about Laverne\u2019s hosting of Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs (since 2018). Not all feedback has been kind, such is the high-profile nature of the gig, but her version of the show really hit its groove earlier this year when revealing episodes with Ian Wright and Daniel Radcliffe made the news (a lockdown special, Your Desert Island Discs, featuring stories of ordinary people, will continue this theme). Less is said about her breakfast gig, which has created a similar, intimate space since Laverne took it over in early 2019. \u201cI like to think of the show as making a new mixtape for a friend every day,\u201d she says, which says a lot about her appeal. The programme is pitched as an adventurous show of musical discovery, in which Laverne plays forgotten classics, obscurities and new releases. More often than not she starts with an unexpected, spirit-raising banger, such as Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s Everyday People or LCD Soundsystem\u2019s All My Friends. But it\u2019s her warm style and inclusive personality that have kept her listeners locked in and that seems particularly well suited to the current times. It\u2019s clear that she thinks a lot about radio\u2019s role in people\u2019s lives. \u201cWhen something dramatic happens in a film or TV, like a big world event, the scene will cut, and you\u2019ll hear someone speaking to you from a radio,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be an old grand dame in the media, but in these situations, it\u2019s what people turn to. Radio\u2019s what we should do well.\u201d In early March, as listeners\u2019 messages started to flood her inbox and Twitter feed, Laverne realised she had to respond to the pandemic and cancelled plans to take a fortnight off: \u201cIt felt right to do that.\u201d 6 Music DJs were possibly better prepared for the situation, Laverne says, because of their experience responding to the emotional reactions of their listeners after David Bowie\u2019s and Prince\u2019s sudden deaths in 2016. \u201cThose were huge moments of collective grief that we had to work out literally live on air. We turned up for work, put our shows in the bin, and realised we had to talk about how people felt. That was very new for us.\u201d In the early days of lockdown, her mood and her music choices were more gentle and calming, but as time moved on, she recognised that our pandemic experiences weren\u2019t just about one emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re sitting in a car going to a funeral, broken-hearted, then someone tells a funny story and you\u2019re all in hysterics. You need different things. Sometimes people want a moment of escape, a kitchen disco, and that\u2019s not necessarily about euphoria. It\u2019s often about catharsis.\u201d Finding music that was hopeful but not chirpy became Laverne\u2019s goal. I mention her playing Coldcut and Lisa Stansfield\u2019s People Hold On around the peak of the epidemic, and how perfect that felt. She nearly leaps off the bed. \u201cOh God, yes! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever played that before, but that was quite a moment.\u201d She\u2019s also been reminded how much great music comes out of struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s there in every genre: rock\u2019n\u2019roll, soul, disco, everything. Music can give us such support.\u201d Listener interaction is a big part of the show \u2013 Laverne alternates between asking her listeners \u201cbig emotional questions\u201d and having \u201cdaft, fun moments\u201d. She mentions a recent \u201clockdown hair\u201d slot, and a picture she\u2019d been sent of a father who\u2019d given both sides of his hair for different children to cut (\u201cI was in stitches\u201d). She also gets sent pictures every day from a listener of his elderly mum. \u201cShe\u2019s 89, she\u2019s self-isolating, called Annelise, and there she is on a Tuesday, waving to me in an amazing hat!\u201d Laverne doesn\u2019t seem to think this is peculiar at all: quite the contrary. \u201cThat\u2019s the really nice thing about the job. You\u2019re a part of people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d She has also heard from listeners who have come to the show for the first time, and more families listening. Does she think people want an escape from the news? \u201cI don\u2019t think they necessarily want an alternative \u2013 they want a counterpoint. We don\u2019t ignore what is happening. We just try to provide the right emotional cushion.\u201d Nothing illustrates this better than the slot every Thursday that the show dedicates to different key workers. These have included groups rarely celebrated in the media: charity fundraisers; delivery drivers; shop workers. Many have got in touch to thank her for remembering them, which has moved her profoundly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting there in your little studio you\u2019re quite sequestered from the world, but your voice is reaching out to places you can\u2019t even imagine. And to think of those people wiping the trolleys, putting the bread on the shelves, messaging you to say thank you for thanking them\u2026 it reminds you what public service broadcasting is here for.\u201d Laverne knows live radio can do this like nothing else can. \u201cIt\u2019s one person broadcasting to one another person, and that intimacy, but it\u2019s also community. And to be doing it at breakfast time, and getting people up to face the day\u2026\u201d She laughs. \u201cWell, above all, you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re playing the right tunes.\u201d JR Who\u2019s your live radio hero? Vanessa Feltz on BBC London is in a league of her own. Whip-smart, not afraid to have fun and with a bloodhound\u2019s nose for a story. What\u2019s your funniest live radio moment? My early days presenting with Shaun Keaveny on XFM, doing live indie bingo with his character Roy \u201cGolden Balls\u201d Butler. All I have to do is look at Shaun still, and I\u2019m in stitches. Your Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4, 5 June, 9am. Lauren Laverne will take part in the BBC\u2019s weekend of music on TV, radio and online to mark what would have been Glastonbury\u2019s 50th anniversary festival, 25-28 June Iain Dale: \u2018I\u2019m literally broadcasting from my bedroom\u2019 Presenter of LBC\u2019s evening show (Mon-Thurs, 7-10pm) \u201cRadio is such an intimate medium compared to television,\u201d says Iain Dale. \u201cOften people think of it as TV\u2019s poor relation. Well, in a crisis like this, it genuinely isn\u2019t.\u201d Dale has been a fixture on LBC, Britain\u2019s biggest commercial news talk station, since 2010 \u2013 he presides over the 7-10pm slot from Monday to Thursday. Far from impartial, the 57-year-old stood as the Tory candidate in North Norfolk in the 2005 general election and, though he later quit active politics, is closer aligned to stablemates Nick Ferrari and Nigel Farage than the left-leaning, Brexit-despairing James O\u2019Brien. But Dale has a soft side too. \u201cOne of the first things I learned when I joined LBC was: open up about yourself, make sure that people can relate to you,\u201d he says, down the line from his house in Tunbridge Wells. \u201cSo my audience knows that I support West Ham, that I drive an Audi, that I have a jack russell and a miniature schnauzer, and that means that when they phone in on an emotional topic, especially if it\u2019s to do with coronavirus, they will talk to you in a way that they just wouldn\u2019t if they were being interviewed on television. It makes it so much more intimate and powerful.\u201d That intimacy has only increased since Dale, who has type 2 diabetes and is therefore at high risk during the pandemic, stopped coming into LBC\u2019s Leicester Square studios in mid-March. \u201cI\u2019m literally broadcasting from my bedroom,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only room in the house with a carpet, so it sucks up the echoes. The duvet, the quilted headboard, the curtains \u2013 they all make it much more of a studio sound. It\u2019s a bit like that Midnight Caller TV programme: you really have got this one-to-one feel. I\u2019ve had a couple of friends say: \u2018You\u2019ve changed since you\u2019ve been doing this at home, you\u2019re sounding much more personal and intimate.\u2019\u201d Dale has had some extraordinarily raw on-air encounters since the pandemic struck. \u201cI had a guy phone in the middle of April saying: \u2018I\u2019ve called you because my mother died of coronavirus two hours ago.\u2019 Your instant thought is, why on earth would you phone a radio station two hours after your mother died? The reason was that he wanted people to obey the government\u2019s instructions, because he hadn\u2019t \u2013 he had gone to visit his mother and now he thought he\u2019d passed on the virus to her and basically killed her. Imagine having that weight on your mind.\u201d The man then phoned again to say he now had the virus himself, and a third time to say that he\u2019d recovered. \u201cOne of the things that the audience like, when a caller has a powerful story to tell, is to hear the follow-up,\u201d says Dale. Politics is still a central part of the show, and Dale points out that his leanings don\u2019t stop him from grilling government ministers over its response to the pandemic and the economic fallout. (He gave minister for London Paul Scully a hard time earlier this month about public transport fare increases, and is critical of Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown trips, tweeting that two of his friends used Cummings\u2019 actions as a justification for rule-bending behaviour of their own.) But it\u2019s his dialogue with listeners that really resonates. When I ask if he considers his show a release valve for the 563,000 people tuning in every week \u2013 LBC says digital listening hours to the show were up by 44% in April compared to February \u2013 Dale replies: \u201cI think this is ultimately public service broadcasting. People think of commercial radio as just commercial, but it isn\u2019t: you are providing a social service in times like this.\u201d Despite the technical challenges of broadcasting from home, it\u2019s worked very well so far, he says. During the show Dale has two laptops on the go, one to communicate with his producers and another to monitor incoming calls. His audio, captured on the \u201creally good\u201d microphone he uses to record his For the Many podcast with Jacqui Smith, is zapped back to Leicester Square with the help of a Mediaport router. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had to go to pre-prepared tape twice in around 50 programmes, which isn\u2019t a bad ratio,\u201d he says. Would he like to continue working from home after lockdown? He does enjoy the lifestyle, he admits \u2013 his husband, John, is at home, and he can walk the dogs every day. But if he\u2019s interviewing a politician, \u201cI like to have the politician in front of me, I like to see the whites of their eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was just doing three hours of straight phone-in, then yes, I could [do it from home]. But, no,\u201d he concludes, with a hint of regret: \u201cI couldn\u2019t do my normal radio show like this all the time.\u201d KF Who\u2019s your live radio hero? Brian Hayes, the Australian presenter who was on LBC, BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio 2. I learned a hell of a lot from him, almost subconsciously, about how to keep an audience engaged and how to talk to people \u2013 if you\u2019re going to be quite acerbic, do it in a way that people don\u2019t think is gratuitously rude. What\u2019s your funniest live radio moment? Five or six years ago, we were doing a discussion on homosexuality and I took a call from Margaret in Glasgow. She was going on about how gay people were sinners and they all had to be shot. At one point I said: \u201cMargaret, can I just stop you there, before you dig your hole even deeper, and tell you that you\u2019re talking to one.\u201d The phone line went silent for about three seconds, which in radio feels like 10. And she said: \u201cOh I didn\u2019t mean you, Iain.\u201d I hope that when she put the phone down, she did some rethinking. Scully and Henrie Kwushue: \u2018We\u2019re definitely on to something here\u2019 Presenters of No Signal 10v10 soundclashes, theresnosignal.com Three months ago, no one had heard of No Signal, now a London-based online radio station with a heaving Twitter base and raucously innovative music shows \u2013 for the simple reason that it didn\u2019t exist. Launched in late March by brothers Jojo and David Sonubi, it has made creative use of the fact that its target audience is stuck at home thirsting for social engagement, with screens and speakers at their disposal. \u201cThe first time I realised we were making a connection beyond our immediate friends group was Nicki Minaj vs Lil Kim,\u201d says Jason Kavuma, AKA Scully, a host of the station\u2019s breakout show, 10v10, which pits two artists\u2019 songs against each other, culminating in a public vote on Twitter. \u201cPrior to that we were getting a couple of hundred listeners. Then several thousand people locked in. A lot of Nicki Minaj fans started voting and it was like: \u2018Oh, this could actually be big.\u2019 Then we featured [UK rappers] J Hus vs Kojo Funds\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd that was huge,\u201d says the show\u2019s alternating host, Henrie Kwushue. \u201cWe were trending No 1 on UK Twitter,\u201d says Kavuma. \u201cBoth artists had heard of the show and were locking in. When we were checking the hashtag #NS10v10, it was no longer just friends of friends. It was random people I\u2019d never heard of coming in and making their opinion known.\u201d It got bigger still when more than a million tuned into Vybz Kartel v Wizkid on 3 May. Adept, charismatic hosts who maintain a lively pace over 90 minutes, Kavuma, 26, and Kwushue, 25, both got their start on the youth-led radio station Reprezent in Brixton. They learned about production as well as presenting \u2013 Kavuma went on to work as an assistant producer at the BBC \u2013 though in both cases it was obvious that they thrived in front of a microphone. When the Sonubi brothers, who run the popular Recess club nights in south London, were seeking hosts for their new lockdown radio project, Kavuma and Kwushue were obvious choices. On 10v10, which airs at 9pm on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays (this evening\u2019s battle is between UK and international drill music), each artist or subgenre is represented by a champion who selects 10 tracks and agitates on their behalf. Kwushue describes it as a gameshow rather than a soundclash \u2013 a judgment less on the quality of the artist than how convincingly they are represented. If the show is a little rough and ready at times \u2013 the participants communicate via Google Hangouts and the resulting audio is streamed to a radio server \u2013 it is more than compensated for by the exuberance of the presenters and the sheer fun they have with their audience on social media. That audience has grown to include the artists themselves. When Nigerian singer Burna Boy was matched against dancehall artist Popcaan, both megastars tuned in and stirred up their followers. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is crazy,\u2019\u201d says Kavuma. \u201c\u2018Two artists that I\u2019m a massive fan of are locking into me talking to other fans of their music from, like, this boxy bedroom. We\u2019re definitely on to something here.\u2019\u201d Their whirlwind success is testament to the freedom and immediacy of online radio \u2013 anyone with a bit of tech knowhow can do it, and fast \u2013 but you still need skill and sharp ideas. The genius of 10v10, according to Kwushue, is combining a communal, live radio event with the instant kick of social media. \u201cPeople love sitting down together, watching each other\u2019s tweets and getting involved in the conversation,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think this is a really new and innovative way to do it.\u201d KF Who\u2019s your live radio hero? Kavuma: Zane Lowe. I like that he gets to play a combination of everything that he finds amazing. As someone with eclectic musical tastes, that\u2019s always inspired me. Kwushue: It\u2019s a toss-up between MistaJam [1Xtra] and Julie Adenuga [Beats 1]. With MistaJam, I used to think I need to be as eloquent, funny and relatable as he is. And Julie is so incredible. What\u2019s your funniest live radio moment? Kavuma: A couple of times while broadcasting out of [shipping container community hub] Pop Brixton for Reprezent, guests would forget to pay for parking. We\u2019d see the ticket warden downstairs and I\u2019d be like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go to a song real quick,\u201d and cut to the song while the artist ran downstairs to plead with the warden. Kwushue: I have a feature on my Reprezent show called Sing the Scenario. When I had [comedian] Mo Gilligan on, he absolutely smashed it. He went far beyond my expectations and it was absolutely hilarious. Petroc Trelawny: \u2018We will be back in the bluebell woods again\u2019 Presenter of Breakfast, BBC Radio 3 (weekdays, 6.30\u20139 am) Every weekday, not long after sunrise, Radio 3 breakfast presenter Petroc Trelawny leaves his house in Camden and walks 25 minutes into work at the BBC\u2019s Broadcasting House. Because he doesn\u2019t need to use public transport, he is one of the few BBC radio presenters still able to go into the studio. In some ways it is spooky: \u201cI\u2019m getting out of the lift, and wandering down empty corridors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know how lucky I am that my life hasn\u2019t changed very much, although it\u2019s very odd to get here walking on such silent streets. But you should see the way the light falls on Regent Street first thing in the morning. It makes you feel very lucky.\u201d Trelawny\u2019s warm, gentle style, and his commitment to his listeners, have helped his show come into its own during lockdown. His audience has been telling him the show is \u201ca lifeline\u201d, he says. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018There\u2019s something very reassuring about the new day starting with this familiar voice. I hear you, and this lovely music, and I know we\u2019ve got through the night.\u2019\u201d Classical music radio listening was already rising before the pandemic: in February 2020, Radio 3 posted its highest audience ratings in years, at 2.13 million listeners. And perhaps it is no surprise that many people are preferring Beethoven and Brahms at breakfast to the unrelenting news cycle (Breakfast now has only one bulletin, midway through the show). Trelawny has noticed his audience broadening, with an increase of messages over social media and email; parents and children, who would have otherwise been in work or in school, are listening, as are families far away from each other, who tune in together. He mentions one 87-year-old self-isolating far from her daughter, who requested a special birthday song for her mother \u2013 a memorable moment. \u201cThese loved ones are three or three hundred miles away from each other, but they\u2019re sharing the experience. That\u2019s very moving,\u201d he says. Trelawny has worked hard to strike the right tone. \u201cI realised early on that there\u2019s no need to be going: \u2018This is a national emergency!\u2019 Everyone knows that. There\u2019s a grave danger in being too portentous.\u201d Often, he lets his music choices speak for him. He has been playing Schubert songs about the importance of working through our relationships, and others about the value of life, or the beauty of the countryside. A recent series of compositions about bluebells was particularly popular. \u201cThere\u2019s a sadness and grief there, of course, but we will be back in the bluebell woods again.\u201d He has also added new, more rousing segments such as March of the Day (\u201cwhich came after a silly conversation with my producer about people missing Match of the Day\u201d) and the show\u2019s Friday sing-along, which has featured Scarborough Fair and A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square. The tunes are first played during the week so listeners can practise, but Trelawny has been at pains for this not to be a public, shared experience. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the lovely familiarity of sharing a song in strange, unfamiliar times. This is not about tweeting videos of yourself. You could be an out-of-work operatic tenor or someone who is literally embarrassed by their singing voice at a wedding \u2013 it\u2019s just about sharing this lovely, private moment. It\u2019s been oddly profound.\u201d Trelawny regularly recommends online performances that his listeners may want to access and recently played a series of songs inspired by museums around the country, which are in need of support. It\u2019s his duty, he feels, to support cultural institutions and practitioners \u201cgoing through a terrible time\u201d and he believes his listeners want to support them, too. He hopes that a renewed enthusiasm for live radio will have a cultural impact long-term. \u201cPeople have realised that the sense of an experience being live, and sharing it together, and being there at the same time as the person who\u2019s guiding you, of being human beings together, means so very much.\u201d JR Who is your live radio hero? Paddy O\u2019Connell on Radio 4\u2019s Broadcasting House. He brings humour and an easy spontaneity to his work, and intelligence. He never sounds overly important. What\u2019s your funniest live radio moment? Having to fill for 15 minutes on a broadcast, as the solo pianist due to do a live concert was still fast asleep. Clare Lynch: \u2018Local radio brings a sense of community that\u2019s been lost in recent years\u2019 Presenter of The Soho Hour, Soho Radio (weekdays, 9-10am) One of Clare Lynch\u2019s worst \u2013 and best \u2013 moments of lockdown so far happened on 9 April, less than a fortnight into her new \u201cself-isolation daily\u201d show on Soho Radio. A regular presenter on the central London online station, who has increased her output fivefold during the pandemic, Lynch was midway through her hour-long breakfast programme when disaster struck. \u201cMy sound desk literally went up in smoke,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt just completely cut out.\u201d Lynch, who has lived in Soho for 20 years, was broadcasting from her flat on Brewer Street, where she\u2019d cobbled together a home studio. After lockdown began on 23 March, she had grabbed a sound card from the now-empty radio station, procured a studio-quality microphone from eBay and covered her bedroom with sound-absorbing fabric and egg trays from the local dairy. She already had a sound desk from working on podcasts \u2013 Lynch produced the art series Sculpting Lives \u2013 and by the end of March she was operational, connecting with guests via Zoom and Zencastr and with listeners via Twitter and Instagram. The sound desk packing in felt like a catastrophe, but help wasn\u2019t far away. \u201cOne of my listeners, who lives on the other end of my street, messaged me on Twitter even before the show had ended, saying: \u2018I have a spare sound desk, do you want me to loan it to you?\u2019 Within an hour, the box was outside my door and next morning I was up and running again. It was incredible.\u201d For Lynch, this gesture underlines the strength of community in Soho, a part of London that people don\u2019t often think of as residential. Normally thronging with shoppers and revellers, the area had fallen disconcertingly quiet since lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s very absent and strange \u2013 I\u2019m still not really used to it,\u201d she says. But as she has reached out to the neighbourhood through her show, the other residents \u2013 \u201cwe have around 3,000 people living here\u201d \u2013 have been tuning in and displaying their appreciation. Local radio has played a vital role in the pandemic, unearthing inspiring tales and forging connections in a crisis. The story of Captain Tom Moore, who raised more than \u00a330m by walking around his garden before his 100th birthday, came to us through BBC Three Counties Radio, while BBC Radio Devon helped connect a frontline NHS worker whose car had broken down with a mechanic who rode to her rescue. The Soho Hour takes a similar approach. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be extremely local in one sense,\u201d says Lynch. Her guests \u2013 she has three on each morning \u2013 have included the local MP, the headteacher of Soho\u2019s primary school, and a lawyer from a nearby practice, attempting to clarify the government\u2019s lockdown guidance. She encourages local traders to send in homemade ads informing customers about opening hours and delivery services. Meanwhile, listeners get in touch to share information on where to buy bedding plants or find the nearest functioning post office. Lynch reads out obituaries, of which there have been a distressing number lately, but also celebrates births, birthdays and other happier occasions. The focus may be local but the appeal of the show, like that of the neighbourhood it represents, is much broader. \u201cSo many people think of Soho as home, even if it\u2019s not where they actually live, and the show is speaking to them as well.\u201d You may not be able to go to Bar Italia, or Gerry\u2019s Club, or the French House, but by interviewing their owners and staff, Lynch has been able to give listeners a connection to the landmarks they love. \u201cIt\u2019s been a way for people to hear each other,\u201d she says. \u201cLocal radio brings a sense of community that has gotten lost in recent years. People are reconnecting with their local community under lockdown, and radio is the perfect entry point.\u201d KF Which radio presenters are seeing you through the pandemic? Cerys Matthews on BBC 6 Music for a whole world of music and sound, and Jane Garvey on BBC Radio 4 Woman\u2019s Hour for Covid-related news. Who\u2019s your live radio hero? I grew up listening to John Peel in my bedroom. His programmes were an education. From my parents\u2019 home in a suburban cultural desert I was able to enter an extraordinary other world.",

      "bodyText": "On 1 April, with the UK death toll rising, 6.9 million people tuned in to the BBC to watch The Repair Shop \u2013 a show about craftspeople who restore treasured possessions like tippling sticks and pub clocks. Surviving as we are in an unfolding, dystopian nightmare, watching a man fix a clock is perhaps the ultimate escapism. In times of upheaval, we don\u2019t want to be thrilled. The ideal feeling is to feel nothing at all. Our interest in one of the biggest sectors of the last decade, post-apocalyptic fiction, will dry up now because \u201cwe\u2019re living it\u201d, says Lesley Thorne, the film/TV rights director at Aitken Alexander literary agents. When Paramount announced last week that it was making a Michael Bay thriller about a virus that won\u2019t stop mutating, the public reaction was a collective whimper of anxiety. My favourite tweet just reads: \u201cBarf. Go away\u201d. Captive and traumatised, we\u2019re asking for something sweeter from the arts. Something more predictable. Speaking to me anonymously, one TV agent told me that the unwritten rule for what gets cut versus what gets commissioned in corona times is: \u201cNothing too depressing; anything with Judi Dench.\u201d When I watch TV these days I treat myself like a very precious and delicate egg. What I want to feel is blank, but it\u2019s difficult. Anything romantic now makes me piercingly lonely. When I watch Bake Off, I\u2019ve started thinking about how nice it would feel to be the dough. The key is to choose programmes that prevent you from thinking, ever, about the future. One friend explains her obsession with MasterChef \u2013 which has been pulling lockdown audiences of nearly 8 million \u2013 in terms of trying to stop time: \u201cIt\u2019s all set in the studio with no daylight so you have no idea what time it is. The idea of time moving forward is terrifying to me now. The way the cook-off format just repeats and repeats makes me feel happy and numb.\u201d What will likely happen is that, as commissioners scramble to provide comfort-viewing on dwindling ad revenue, more adventurous work simply won\u2019t get made. John Ridley, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of 12 Years A Slave, has had his latest film dropped in the wake of coronavirus. In an interview with the LA Times, Ridley explained that the objection to the project was that it was a story about race that was morally ambiguous, with no clear hero and victim: \u201cThere is no bad guy \u2026 But if we can\u2019t tell this story, I don\u2019t know how you get into something that is more complicated, showing people of colour suffering in a different way.\u201d If the point of art is to make people feel things \u2013 difficult, contradictory things \u2013 what happens to that art when people just want to feel nothing? \u201cPeople want happiness and escapism \u2013 of course they do,\u201d said Ridley. \u201cBut \u2026 it breaks my heart that most people won\u2019t have the wherewithal to go after something more complicated.\u201d Moral uncertainty is difficult to stomach now.

      "bodyText": "A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families. Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures. As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year \u2013 a 63% increase compared to 2018. Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network. America\u2019s food insecurity crisis was dire even before the Covid-19 pandemic, when at least 37 million people lived in households without adequate resources to guarantee consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. Food insecurity varies vastly from state to state, and county to county, and had only recently fallen to pre-Great Recession levels. The current crisis will almost certainly reverse hard-fought for improvements, and exacerbate existing inequalities. It\u2019s in southern states where the economic impact and food insecurity will probably penetrate deepest: more than 11 million people in the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Tennessee are projected to suffer food insecurity in 2020. The projections assume a national annual unemployment rate of 11.5% \u2013 7.6 percentage points higher than 2018 \u2013 and a national annual poverty rate of 16.6% \u2013 4.8 points higher than 2018. In Mississippi, proportionately the worst-affected state before and since the pandemic, almost three-quarters of a million people could need food aid this year, including one in every three children. Further west, tourist mecca Las Vegas is bracing itself for tough times as even the casinos, hotels and restaurants which survive the shutdown will take months to fully reopen. \u201cWe were on the precipice of being the first food bank to meet the meal gap but we just don\u2019t have the food sources to meet this sudden, dramatic increase. We have to completely retool our organization to accommodate this,\u201d said Larry Scott, chief operating officer of the Three Square food bank in the city. Here, about 65% more food aid will be needed to stop people from going hungry: one of the biggest jumps in the country. \u201cPeople are going to go hungry, that\u2019s the truth,\u201d said Scott. The situation looks dire statewide: one in three children and one in five adults in Nevada are projected to suffer from food insecurity this year \u2013 a rise of almost 60% since 2018. Why? The Nevada jobless figure is higher than any state ever, including during the Great Depression, signaling an extraordinary turnabout in fortune after unemployment hit an all-time-low in February. \u201cThis pandemic continues to impact the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors nationwide, putting millions of additional people at risk of hunger while continuing to hurt people already familiar with hardship,\u201d said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America.

Food banks aren\u2019t in it alone. Record numbers of people have applied for food stamps, and advocates are pushing for the bump in how much people receive to be included in the next federal relief package, pointing to individual and wider economic benefits. Research shows that every $1bn spent on food stamps results in $1.54bn being added to gross domestic product. In addition, the US department of agriculture (USDA)\u2019s $3bn coronavirus Farmers to Families Food Box programme has started delivering truckloads of surplus perishable produce like milk, meat and vegetables to food banks and pantries. But it\u2019s unclear how long this and other federal aid will last, which is causing advocates sleepless nights. \u201cEverything feels so unpredictable, I\u2019ve literally no idea what\u2019s going to happen in three months, and we got the short end of the stick from the USDA,\u201d said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts. In this region, one in six is expected to suffer food insecurity in 2020 \u2013 a 50% rise due to Covid-19, with predominantly black and brown urban areas hardest hit.

      "body": "<p>Neuroscientist <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KJFRI52\">Karl Friston</a>, of University College London, builds mathematical models of human brain function. Lately, he\u2019s been applying his modelling to Covid-19, and using what he learns to advise <a href=\"http://www.independentsage.org/\">Independent Sage</a>, the committee set up as an alternative to the UK government\u2019s official pandemic advice body, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). </p> <p><strong>How do the models you use differ from the conventional ones epidemiologists</strong><strong> rely</strong><strong> on to advise governments in this pandemic?<br></strong>Conventional models essentially fit curves to historical data and then extrapolate those curves into the future. They look at the surface of the phenomenon \u2013 the observable part, or data. Our approach, which borrows from physics and in particular the work of Richard Feynman, goes under the bonnet. It attempts to capture the mathematical structure of the phenomenon \u2013 in this case, the pandemic \u2013 and to understand the causes of what is observed. Since we don\u2019t know all the causes, we have to infer them. But that inference, and implicit uncertainty, is built into the models. That\u2019s why we call them generative models, because they contain everything you need to know to generate the data. As more data comes in, you adjust your beliefs about the causes, until your model simulates the data as accurately and as simply as possible.</p> <p><strong>Can you give an example of what you mean by uncertainty, with respect to Covid-19, and how you build it into your models?<br></strong>A common type of epidemiological model used today is the SEIR model, which considers that people must be in one of four states \u2013 susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) or recovered (R). Unfortunately, reality doesn\u2019t break them down so neatly. For example, what does it mean to be recovered? We know that with Covid-19 you can be infected but asymptomatic, so does it mean recovered from the symptoms or recovered from the infection? And that question hides a host of others, including questions relating to national testing strategies. SEIR models start to fall apart when you think about the underlying causes of the data. You need models that can allow for all possible states, and assess which ones matter for shaping the pandemic\u2019s trajectory over time.</p> <p><strong>This is the first time the generative approach has been applied to a pandemic</strong><strong>.

They\u2019ve been running your iPhone and nuclear power stations for a long time. In my field, neurobiology, we call the approach dynamic causal modelling (DCM). We can\u2019t see brain states directly, but we can infer them given brain imaging data. In fact, we have pushed that idea even further. We think the brain may be doing its own dynamic causal modelling, reducing its uncertainty about the causes of the data the senses feed to it. We call this the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/\">free energy principle</a>. But whether you\u2019re talking about a pandemic or a brain, <a href=\"https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/karl-friston-takes-on-the-pandemic-with-the-brain-s-arsenal\">the essential problem is the same</a> \u2013 you\u2019re trying to understand a complex system that changes over time.

The data is generated by Covid-19 patients rather than neurons, but otherwise it\u2019s just another day at the office.</p> <p><strong>You say generative models are also more efficient than conventional ones. What do you mean?<br></strong>Epidemiologists currently tackle the inference problem by number-crunching on a huge scale, making use of high-performance computers. Imagine you want to simulate an outbreak in Scotland. Using conventional approaches, this would take you a day or longer with today\u2019s computing resources. And that\u2019s just to simulate one model or hypothesis \u2013 one set of parameters and one set of starting conditions. Using DCM, you can do the same thing in a minute.

With conventional SEIR models, interventions and surveillance are something you add to the model \u2013 tweaks or perturbations \u2013 so that you can see their effect on morbidity and mortality. But with a generative model these things are built into the model itself, along with everything else that matters. Our response as individuals \u2013 and as a society \u2013 becomes part of the epidemiological process, part of one big self-organising, self-monitoring system. That means it is possible to predict not only numbers of cases and deaths in the future, but also societal and institutional responses \u2013 and to attach precise dates to those predictions.</p> <p><strong>How well have your predictions been borne out</strong><strong> in this first wave of infections?<br></strong>For London, we <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04463.pdf\">predicted</a> that hospital admissions would peak on 5 April, deaths would peak five days later, and critical care unit occupancy would not exceed capacity \u2013 meaning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">Nightingale</a> hospitals would not be required. We also predicted that improvements would be seen in the capital by 8 May that might allow social distancing measures to be relaxed \u2013 which they were in the prime minister\u2019s announcement on 10 May.

I\u2019ve heard defensive politicians say its very existence impugns the real Sage, but as a scientist I can\u2019t subscribe to that. In my view there can never be anything wrong with transparent, informed discussion.

The real worry is that a second wave could erupt some months down the line when that immunity wears off. We can test a range of hypotheses, based on a very short duration of immunity \u2013 as with a common cold \u2013 right through to immunity that lasts for decades. For each duration we can calculate the probability that a second wave will emerge, and when. It\u2019s early days for this work, and I look forward with genuine excitement to new data on immunity becoming available, now that reliable antibody <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/public-health-england-approves-roche-test-for-coronavirus-antibodies\">tests</a> exist. But the important message is that we have a window of opportunity now, to get test-and-trace protocols in place ahead of that putative second wave.

Why? There are various possible explanations, but one that looks increasingly likely is that Germany has more immunological \u201cdark matter\u201d \u2013 people who are impervious to infection, perhaps because they are geographically isolated or have some kind of natural resistance. This is like dark matter in the universe: we can\u2019t see it, but we know it must be there to account for what we can see.

      "bodyText": "Neuroscientist Karl Friston, of University College London, builds mathematical models of human brain function. Lately, he\u2019s been applying his modelling to Covid-19, and using what he learns to advise Independent Sage, the committee set up as an alternative to the UK government\u2019s official pandemic advice body, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). How do the models you use differ from the conventional ones epidemiologists rely on to advise governments in this pandemic? Conventional models essentially fit curves to historical data and then extrapolate those curves into the future. They look at the surface of the phenomenon \u2013 the observable part, or data. Our approach, which borrows from physics and in particular the work of Richard Feynman, goes under the bonnet. It attempts to capture the mathematical structure of the phenomenon \u2013 in this case, the pandemic \u2013 and to understand the causes of what is observed. Since we don\u2019t know all the causes, we have to infer them. But that inference, and implicit uncertainty, is built into the models. That\u2019s why we call them generative models, because they contain everything you need to know to generate the data. As more data comes in, you adjust your beliefs about the causes, until your model simulates the data as accurately and as simply as possible. Can you give an example of what you mean by uncertainty, with respect to Covid-19, and how you build it into your models? A common type of epidemiological model used today is the SEIR model, which considers that people must be in one of four states \u2013 susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) or recovered (R). Unfortunately, reality doesn\u2019t break them down so neatly. For example, what does it mean to be recovered? We know that with Covid-19 you can be infected but asymptomatic, so does it mean recovered from the symptoms or recovered from the infection? And that question hides a host of others, including questions relating to national testing strategies. SEIR models start to fall apart when you think about the underlying causes of the data. You need models that can allow for all possible states, and assess which ones matter for shaping the pandemic\u2019s trajectory over time.

I think I\u2019m just trying to recreate that lost home.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa Lane, 54, and her fianc\u00e9 Peter Baker, 62, met as DJs on the vintage weekender scene. The couple bonded over their shared passion for the mid-20th century and recently moved to a 1929 three-bed semi which they are restoring to a 1930s look, ripping out the UPVC windows and replacing them with wooden windows with art deco motifs, and painting the exterior a lively primrose offset by black gloss.</p> <p>The couple regularly invite neighbours round for a sit-down tea of meat and two veg plus apple pie or steamed pudding, and Lane, who runs vintage shop the Source Pot in Wigan, has noticed an improvement in her health since she switched to a midcentury diet. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, wholesome stuff like the food you used to eat as a kid before you ran out to play,\u201d she explains. \u201cNothing fussy or flown in.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes<em><strong> </strong></em>to a yearning for the social mores of times gone by, there\u2019s an obvious rub. Stern speaks of the dark side of nostalgia \u2013 its tendency to naturalise colonialism and the (supposedly vanished) days of male supremacy, and \u201cmake domination appear innocent and pure\u201d. Social psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley speaks of the problematic elisions in the idea of a \u201cretreat to the comforts of grandma\u2019s apron\u201d. She asks: \u201cWhere\u2019s grandma\u2019s lived experience in all this? What if her life was actually quite grim, cooking meals from scratch in a cold kitchen\u2026? What if she\u2019d have killed for a microwave?\u201d</p> <p>Ernie Samat, 54, graduated to vintage living through the war reenactment scene, where he dressed as a Second World War RAF officer, to his current civilian style: three-piece tweeds, with a silk handkerchief (\u201cstrictly top left pocket\u201d) and brogues. The look is based on photographs of Samat\u2019s socialite grandparents in 1930s Singapore. \u201cThey dressed so elegantly,\u201d he explains, \u201cit\u2019s sad I never really got to know them.\u201d</p> <p>Samat has stripped the fireplace in his Wanstead sitting room back to its Arts and Crafts surround and installed a chaise longue and period display cabinets. Decor, however, is an ongoing compromise with his partner Lorraine Wood, 61: \u201cShe\u2019s not into living in a museum, so I only get a few rooms where I can express myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c2c72309a4216158d483b965162495b35406d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c2c72309a4216158d483b965162495b35406d72/0_28_8281_10347/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s a complex story of attachment to a motherland that in many ways rejects you\u2019: 1940s style fan Ernie Samat.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a complex story of attachment to a motherland that in many ways rejects you\u2019: 1940s style fan Ernie Samat, photographed at the Two Brewers pub, 34 Park Street, Windsor SL4 1LB.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Samat, his involvement in the vintage scene is a tribute to the Commonwealth citizens who are airbrushed out of history: \u201cIt\u2019s a complex story that isn\u2019t really told, of attachment to a motherland that in many ways rejects you.\u201d</p> <p>Bristol-based Mick Sinclair, 53, admits his favoured vintage incarnation as a wartime contraband-pedalling spiv might play into the hands of outdated social attitudes which, he says, are sadly prevalent on the wartime vintage scene: \u201cBrexit hasn\u2019t helped with that.\u201d But he points out that the UK scene doesn\u2019t have the same association with rightwing politics seen in the similar \u201ctradlife\u201d movement in the US, which shades into surrenderism (it advocates the \u201ctraditional\u201d submission of wives to their husbands) and white supremacy.</p> <p>Sinclair also experimented with military wear before settling upon a 40s three-piece suit, trilby and pipe. \u201cMy parents were upright Jamaicans who raised me properly and taught me respect,\u201d he says of his London childhood. \u201cThe way I see it, everything went a bit south with the 1960s, when the railways were closed and all that.\u201d</p> <p>There is a tension in the vintage-living world between era purists, who live their favoured period down to the fashions and decor of a designated year, and adherents with a more free-wheeling attitude to authenticity. Era-trolls stalking social media to pile on to inaccuracies in diet and dress are a growing problem. Turner and Easton recently came offline for a period after suffering a spate of trolling at the hands of an incensed historian. Samat speaks of middle-aged men on the reenactment scene being upbraided for wearing replica uniforms meant for lithe 20-something paratroopers. \u201cOften people just think that I want to put women back into the kitchen,\u201d Koropisz says of the criticism he typically faces. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t, for the record.\u201d</p> <p>Sims says that critics who argue that these impulses are de facto reactionary are missing much of the subculture\u2019s subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to scoff at the idea of these throwbacks who have no idea how repressive it was to be a 1950s housewife,\u201d she says. \u201cBut many of the people I interviewed [for her PhD] talked about the inspirational socialism of the postwar era: the founding of the NHS, for example, or the pursuit of the common good.\u201d</p> <p>Bilson, for her part, strives to resist golden ageism about the decade that produced Thatcherism and the three-day week, and refuses to give herself a hard time about cherry-picking the best of the 70s. She, like most living historians, has held on to her mobile phone.</p> <p>Koropisz\u2019s vintage Victorian bicycle was recently stolen, so he\u2019s reluctantly travelling by car until a longed-for horse and carriage is within financial reach. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to get into a taxi wearing a top hat and frock coat,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically, you have to almost fully undress.\u201d</p> <p>The idea that any era was purely \u201cof itself\u201d is, of course, nonsense anyway, as historian Claire Langhamer points out. \u201cHistory is messy and midcentury houses were full of all sorts of things from other periods,\u201d she says. \u201cSo living historians who pick and choose their favourite bits of the 40s and 50s are perfectly in keeping.\u201d</p> <p>In Laura Wade\u2019s 2019 Olivier award-winning play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/04/home-im-darling-review-laura-wade-katherine-parkinson\" title=\"\">Home, I\u2019m Darling</a></em>, protagonist Judy becomes disillusioned by her office job and takes voluntary redundancy to devote herself to living like a 1950s housewife. We meet Judy dressed in a frilly apron and pearls, slicing the top off her husband\u2019s breakfast egg before she waves him goodbye at the door with a perfect smile. It\u2019s Judy\u2019s mother Fran, a battle-scarred second-wave feminist, who brings a dose of reality to this honeyed fiction. \u201cThe 50s were dull, cold and grey with bomb holes still around, and your husband had a legal right to fuck you,\u201d she scoffs. \u201cThis is a cartoon.\u201d</p> <p>The tension between fantasy and reality can serve another purpose for retromaniacs, says Sims. \u201cIf they think about it, most people don\u2019t want to live the social conditions, or hardships of the 1950s,\u201d she says. \u201cImmersion in history can be a way of realising how much we have to be thankful for in the here and now.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct a reference to the \u201c2012 Golden Jubilee\u201d; that year saw Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Diamond Jubilee.</p>",

Eavesdroppers might even catch the strains of Gilbert and Sullivan issuing from an 1890s gramophone as Michael Koropisz, a 24-year-old portrait artist who goes about his daily life as if he\u2019s a well-to-do Briton of the 1890s, stages a tea party for fellow Victorian enthusiasts. \u201cWe do get children pointing and laughing, and passersby taking selfies in front of us,\u201d says Koropisz, who wears a top hat and 120-year-old frock coat, and adheres to a \u201cpious\u201d code of conduct. Koropisz, who also eschews television and any \u201cmusic that post-dates 1900\u201d, hosts these Saturday-night tea parties in his bedroom at his parents\u2019 house, which is fitted out with replica cornicing and ceiling roses, a grandfather clock, an upright ebony piano and a bureau for the ink stand and quill that replaced his laptop when his historical enthusiasm became a lifestyle in 2017. His dad Bob, a plasterer, helped with the wood- panelling and classical dentils, with the refit costing \u00a38,000. \u201cMy parents are Ukrainian and a bit bemused by my choices, but they\u2019re very supportive,\u201d explains Koropisz. \u201cI just think that when all the cornicing and arches and aesthetic stuff went away the best of society went with it,\u201d he explains, adding that he takes his behavioural lead from Victorian etiquette books. Koropisz is one of a growing number of Britons seeking to embrace a lifestyle based on a past era \u2013 nostalgia enthusiasts who see more value in the past than the present and choose to dress, eat and behave to suit. In her work on cultural nostalgia, US academic Barbara B Stern differentiates between two brands of nostalgia: \u201chistorical nostalgia\u201d, which expresses a desire to retreat from contemporary life into a distant past viewed as superior to the present; and \u201cpersonal nostalgia\u201d, which recollects a (largely fictionalised) home of one\u2019s childhood as a font of warmth, security and love. \u201cNostalgia has a number of psychological functions,\u201d explains Tim Wildschut, a professor of psychology at the University of Southampton who studies personal nostalgia. \u201cIt gives meaning and connectedness, and makes sense of our own identity through time as well as offering us escape from the troubles of the present.\u201d Nostalgia, he says, is exerting a particularly powerful pull now, in a moment of national crisis that calls to mind the Second World War years, which are popularly presented as the embodiment of gumption and community spirit. \u201cOur research shows that loneliness and social isolation trigger nostalgia. Nostalgia, in turn, increases perceived social connectedness and support. Viewed in this way, nostalgia offsets the negative effects of loneliness.\u201d Living history offers a dual pay-off, forming our self-hood as it swaddles us in the psychological comfort blanket of an imagined past. Britons have long enjoyed vintage dress-up: 50s teddy boys based their style on Edwardian street gangs; men born long after D-Day still gather to reenact the battles of both world wars. What\u2019s new are people who, like Koropisz, commit to living their lives as if the intervening 40, 50 or 130 years never happened \u2013 as well as the communities that have grown around vintage lifestyles. The latter include online interest groups, such as the #tradwife movement; weekends themed for everything from 50s dancing to the lifestyle of the world wars and subsequent years (the War and Peace Revival attracted 50,000 attendees for its fourth outing in 2019); and the grand Victorian balls that are the highlight of Koropisz\u2019s year. While the scene has been emergent since the turn of the millennium, the 2012 Diamond Jubilee supercharged British nostalgia for the 1950s, says Dr Stella Sims, who wrote her cultural studies doctorate on this wave of \u201cretromania\u201d. \u201cIn the early 2010s you got this surge of interest in 1950s fashion and pastimes, from knitting to partner-dancing, cupcake baking and the WI,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the World War One centennial, from 2014-2018, also fed into this.\u201d For University of Sussex historian Claire Langhamer, the nostalgia for 20th century lifestyles, in particular, can be put down to a cultural appetite for escapism. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on at the moment, from the climate to Brexit and now Covid-19, it\u2019s no wonder there\u2019s this urge to retreat to an era when the future seemed to be about progress and optimism, rather than environmental and political collapse,\u201d she says, adding that living historians\u2019 fetishistic focus on domestic arrangements is telling. \u201cWhen you have no hope of affording your own home it\u2019s seductive, isn\u2019t it, to hark back to eras when home ownership was an ordinary expectation?\u201d The domestic retreat demanded by the coronavirus lockdown, she adds, has served to heighten people\u2019s focus on domestic aesthetics and routines. The living history scene has its celebrities: period tailor Zack Pinsent (@pinsent_tailoring) commands 355,000 followers on Instagram, Georgian enthusiast Kitty Pridden (@18thCent_Kitty) feeds 6,000 Twitter followers close-ups of powdered wigs and court dress; and Dean Turner and Linda Easton have achieved social media fame with their 1940s aesthetic, house and garden. \u201cIt\u2019s the community that I like,\u201d says Estelle Bilson, 41, a technical designer who shares her love of 1970s living with Stephen De Sarasola and their son, and bases her style on a Good Life-era Penelope Keith. \u201cA woman in the States recently sent me a frosted Christmas bauble because she knows it\u2019s the era I\u2019m into, but we\u2019ve never met.\u201d The family enjoy Angel Delight and \u201chilariously phallic\u201d Fanny Craddock banana candles in their \u201cpretty orangey\u201d dining room, surrounded by teak G-Plan furniture, wicker hanging baskets, JH Lynch portraits and a sunburst rug. When Bilson recently bagged a 70s bathroom suite for \u00a39.99 on eBay, De Sarasola, a sound engineer, demurred: \u201cI told her straight out: it\u2019s shit-brown.\u201d De Sarasola also takes exception to the peacock TV light and tiger\u2019s head planters which sit, grimacing, in the dining room. \u201cI prefer a 70s look that\u2019s a bit more Sly and the Family Stone and less \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 Elvis,\u201d he explains. Bilson takes pleasure in the fact that the family\u2019s lifestyle is eco by default, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing bought new in the house, apart from mattresses, so we have a naturally low carbon footprint,\u201d she says, adding that, for many living historians, sustainability is part of the attraction. \u201cAnalogue technology is also much easier to fix,\u201d she says. When asked about the motivations that led to her retro immersion, Bilson\u2019s answer is straight out of Wildschut\u2019s personal nostalgia playbook. \u201cMy earliest memory is from 1980, when my family was flooded out of our bungalow and re-homed in a council house without our Bauhaus long chair and lovely cabinets,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was pretty traumatic. I think I\u2019m just trying to recreate that lost home.\u201d Lisa Lane, 54, and her fianc\u00e9 Peter Baker, 62, met as DJs on the vintage weekender scene. The couple bonded over their shared passion for the mid-20th century and recently moved to a 1929 three-bed semi which they are restoring to a 1930s look, ripping out the UPVC windows and replacing them with wooden windows with art deco motifs, and painting the exterior a lively primrose offset by black gloss. The couple regularly invite neighbours round for a sit-down tea of meat and two veg plus apple pie or steamed pudding, and Lane, who runs vintage shop the Source Pot in Wigan, has noticed an improvement in her health since she switched to a midcentury diet. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, wholesome stuff like the food you used to eat as a kid before you ran out to play,\u201d she explains. \u201cNothing fussy or flown in.\u201d When it comes to a yearning for the social mores of times gone by, there\u2019s an obvious rub. Stern speaks of the dark side of nostalgia \u2013 its tendency to naturalise colonialism and the (supposedly vanished) days of male supremacy, and \u201cmake domination appear innocent and pure\u201d. Social psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley speaks of the problematic elisions in the idea of a \u201cretreat to the comforts of grandma\u2019s apron\u201d. She asks: \u201cWhere\u2019s grandma\u2019s lived experience in all this? What if her life was actually quite grim, cooking meals from scratch in a cold kitchen\u2026? What if she\u2019d have killed for a microwave?\u201d Ernie Samat, 54, graduated to vintage living through the war reenactment scene, where he dressed as a Second World War RAF officer, to his current civilian style: three-piece tweeds, with a silk handkerchief (\u201cstrictly top left pocket\u201d) and brogues. The look is based on photographs of Samat\u2019s socialite grandparents in 1930s Singapore. \u201cThey dressed so elegantly,\u201d he explains, \u201cit\u2019s sad I never really got to know them.\u201d Samat has stripped the fireplace in his Wanstead sitting room back to its Arts and Crafts surround and installed a chaise longue and period display cabinets. Decor, however, is an ongoing compromise with his partner Lorraine Wood, 61: \u201cShe\u2019s not into living in a museum, so I only get a few rooms where I can express myself.\u201d For Samat, his involvement in the vintage scene is a tribute to the Commonwealth citizens who are airbrushed out of history: \u201cIt\u2019s a complex story that isn\u2019t really told, of attachment to a motherland that in many ways rejects you.\u201d Bristol-based Mick Sinclair, 53, admits his favoured vintage incarnation as a wartime contraband-pedalling spiv might play into the hands of outdated social attitudes which, he says, are sadly prevalent on the wartime vintage scene: \u201cBrexit hasn\u2019t helped with that.\u201d But he points out that the UK scene doesn\u2019t have the same association with rightwing politics seen in the similar \u201ctradlife\u201d movement in the US, which shades into surrenderism (it advocates the \u201ctraditional\u201d submission of wives to their husbands) and white supremacy. Sinclair also experimented with military wear before settling upon a 40s three-piece suit, trilby and pipe. \u201cMy parents were upright Jamaicans who raised me properly and taught me respect,\u201d he says of his London childhood. \u201cThe way I see it, everything went a bit south with the 1960s, when the railways were closed and all that.\u201d There is a tension in the vintage-living world between era purists, who live their favoured period down to the fashions and decor of a designated year, and adherents with a more free-wheeling attitude to authenticity. Era-trolls stalking social media to pile on to inaccuracies in diet and dress are a growing problem. Turner and Easton recently came offline for a period after suffering a spate of trolling at the hands of an incensed historian. Samat speaks of middle-aged men on the reenactment scene being upbraided for wearing replica uniforms meant for lithe 20-something paratroopers. \u201cOften people just think that I want to put women back into the kitchen,\u201d Koropisz says of the criticism he typically faces. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t, for the record.\u201d Sims says that critics who argue that these impulses are de facto reactionary are missing much of the subculture\u2019s subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to scoff at the idea of these throwbacks who have no idea how repressive it was to be a 1950s housewife,\u201d she says. \u201cBut many of the people I interviewed [for her PhD] talked about the inspirational socialism of the postwar era: the founding of the NHS, for example, or the pursuit of the common good.\u201d Bilson, for her part, strives to resist golden ageism about the decade that produced Thatcherism and the three-day week, and refuses to give herself a hard time about cherry-picking the best of the 70s. She, like most living historians, has held on to her mobile phone. Koropisz\u2019s vintage Victorian bicycle was recently stolen, so he\u2019s reluctantly travelling by car until a longed-for horse and carriage is within financial reach. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to get into a taxi wearing a top hat and frock coat,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically, you have to almost fully undress.\u201d The idea that any era was purely \u201cof itself\u201d is, of course, nonsense anyway, as historian Claire Langhamer points out. \u201cHistory is messy and midcentury houses were full of all sorts of things from other periods,\u201d she says. \u201cSo living historians who pick and choose their favourite bits of the 40s and 50s are perfectly in keeping.\u201d In Laura Wade\u2019s 2019 Olivier award-winning play, Home, I\u2019m Darling, protagonist Judy becomes disillusioned by her office job and takes voluntary redundancy to devote herself to living like a 1950s housewife. We meet Judy dressed in a frilly apron and pearls, slicing the top off her husband\u2019s breakfast egg before she waves him goodbye at the door with a perfect smile. It\u2019s Judy\u2019s mother Fran, a battle-scarred second-wave feminist, who brings a dose of reality to this honeyed fiction. \u201cThe 50s were dull, cold and grey with bomb holes still around, and your husband had a legal right to fuck you,\u201d she scoffs. \u201cThis is a cartoon.\u201d The tension between fantasy and reality can serve another purpose for retromaniacs, says Sims. \u201cIf they think about it, most people don\u2019t want to live the social conditions, or hardships of the 1950s,\u201d she says. \u201cImmersion in history can be a way of realising how much we have to be thankful for in the here and now.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct a reference to the \u201c2012 Golden Jubilee\u201d; that year saw Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Diamond Jubilee.",

And that\u2019s why the test and tracing system will help us not just bear down on the virus, but take further steps along our roadmap to bringing life back to something a bit more resembling normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked whether this meant the possible lockdown of an entire city, such as Manchester, Raab replied: \u201cWe will make sure we\u2019ve got the panoply of measures that can be taken in a targeted way. I\u2019ve been following the geographic data for weeks now, and there are slight variations. But overall we\u2019ve made good progress across the four nations, across regions, in bringing down the virus.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Questioned again on whether this meant the possible targeted lockdown of certain cities or areas, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got the ability and we will target specific settings or particular regions, or geographic areas, yes, absolutely. And that gives us the confidence to make sure-footed steps forward in the way that we\u2019re doing tomorrow.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government is facing intense pressure over its decision to ease restrictions, with a number of scientists who attend Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group&nbsp;for&nbsp;Emergencies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">warning </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">it has come too soon</a>, with England still recording about 8,000 new infections a day.</p> \n<p>In a separate interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Raab said it was up to politicians to \u201ctake the final judgment call\u201d on such decisions.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right to say that the scientists won\u2019t always agree,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is actually the essence of the Sage group. There are, at any one time, 25 scientists who are participating, and a whole range of other sub-groups, and the expert advice that they get. And frankly, with a new pandemic it would be totally surprising if they all agreed in unanimity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government had previously said it would not ease restrictions before its own traffic-light system of coronavirus alert, which is set by the UK\u2019s new joint biosecurity centre (JBC), had moved from four to three.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Raab told the Andrew Marr Show that the level was \u201ctransitioning from level four to level three\u201d, but that the decision would be made by the JBC when it was fully opertional.</p> \n<p>But, he said, progress had been made, with the number of new cases and of critically ill Covid-19 cases falling: \u201cBecause we\u2019ve made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely, week in, week, out, we can \u2013 very gradually, very carefully \u2013 take the steps that we are taking tomorrow.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cOf course, we won\u2019t take any further steps, or indeed we\u2019ll have to take further restrictive measures, if we find any uptick in the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>A key element of the gradual opening is the new test and trace system, under which new local outbreaks are meant to be snuffed out by tracing teams identifying people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients and getting them to self-isolate for 14 days.</p> \n<p>Raab said the system, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-creating-false-sense-of-security\">has also faced criticism</a> for being far from completely ready, has the capacity to trace the contacts for up to 10,000 cases.</p> \n<p>Asked how many people had been traced so far, Raab said: \u201cI don\u2019t have the exact figures, because it\u2019s only been running since Thursday, but they will be set out this week.\u201d</p>",

Asked what would happen if the relaxing of rules, which allow groups of up to six people to meet outdoors from Monday, brought a rise in infections, Raab said the government did not want to reimpose national restrictions. \u201cWhat we really want to avoid is any re-entering of the lockdown,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. \u201cIf we had a second spike, in the way you\u2019ve described, it would obviously be bad on public health grounds, but it would be bad for the economy, and I think it would be bad for public confidence. \u201cSo the really important thing is, as we take the measures, if there\u2019s any uptick in any particular locality or setting, we\u2019ve got the ability to take targeted measures. And that\u2019s why the test and tracing system will help us not just bear down on the virus, but take further steps along our roadmap to bringing life back to something a bit more resembling normal.\u201d Asked whether this meant the possible lockdown of an entire city, such as Manchester, Raab replied: \u201cWe will make sure we\u2019ve got the panoply of measures that can be taken in a targeted way. I\u2019ve been following the geographic data for weeks now, and there are slight variations. But overall we\u2019ve made good progress across the four nations, across regions, in bringing down the virus.\u201d Questioned again on whether this meant the possible targeted lockdown of certain cities or areas, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got the ability and we will target specific settings or particular regions, or geographic areas, yes, absolutely. And that gives us the confidence to make sure-footed steps forward in the way that we\u2019re doing tomorrow.\u201d The government is facing intense pressure over its decision to ease restrictions, with a number of scientists who attend Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, warning it has come too soon, with England still recording about 8,000 new infections a day. In a separate interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Raab said it was up to politicians to \u201ctake the final judgment call\u201d on such decisions. \u201cYou\u2019re right to say that the scientists won\u2019t always agree,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is actually the essence of the Sage group. There are, at any one time, 25 scientists who are participating, and a whole range of other sub-groups, and the expert advice that they get. And frankly, with a new pandemic it would be totally surprising if they all agreed in unanimity.\u201d The government had previously said it would not ease restrictions before its own traffic-light system of coronavirus alert, which is set by the UK\u2019s new joint biosecurity centre (JBC), had moved from four to three. Raab told the Andrew Marr Show that the level was \u201ctransitioning from level four to level three\u201d, but that the decision would be made by the JBC when it was fully opertional. But, he said, progress had been made, with the number of new cases and of critically ill Covid-19 cases falling: \u201cBecause we\u2019ve made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely, week in, week, out, we can \u2013 very gradually, very carefully \u2013 take the steps that we are taking tomorrow.\u201d He added: \u201cOf course, we won\u2019t take any further steps, or indeed we\u2019ll have to take further restrictive measures, if we find any uptick in the virus.\u201d A key element of the gradual opening is the new test and trace system, under which new local outbreaks are meant to be snuffed out by tracing teams identifying people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients and getting them to self-isolate for 14 days. Raab said the system, which has also faced criticism for being far from completely ready, has the capacity to trace the contacts for up to 10,000 cases. Asked how many people had been traced so far, Raab said: \u201cI don\u2019t have the exact figures, because it\u2019s only been running since Thursday, but they will be set out this week.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Every Thursday at 8pm, millions of Britons have opened their front doors or stood on balconies to applaud the NHS. The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, \u201cwe already have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020\">fantastic NHS,</a> fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d</p> <p>Yet those who have experienced the government\u2019s emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte.</p> <p>Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon.</p> <p>When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020\">the job</a> would be done with an as\u2013yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\" data-alt=\"Testing infrastructure\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\">Testing infrastructure</a> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic.</p> <p>They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour\u2019s years in power.</p> <p>\u201cThe undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,\u201d said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. \u201cThere has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you\u2019re now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Councils left in the dark</h2> <p>Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>Yet Newham\u2019s director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02/1100_1065_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point.</p> <p>Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk \u2013 many of them over 70, living alone and isolated.</p> <p>Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate.</p> <p>\u201cContact tracing is a sensitive issue \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people\u2019s local context,\u201d Strelitz said.</p> <p>Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns. Speaking earlier this month he said there was \u201ca huge disconnect\u201d between different branches of government, with some functions of the local public health system having been disabled in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like environmental health officers, community and neighbourhood teams, youth services workers \u2013 the people who you could deploy in a crisis, who already know where the vulnerable are and how to reach them \u2013 those were the kind of staff they used during 2009 swine flu to work closely with the NHS, but they have been lost,\u201d Harrison said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1/0_35_3878_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Labour leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, said Conservative ministers had spent so many years shrinking the state locally \u201cthey have forgotten what local authorities can do\u201d. Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has <a href=\"https://mhclgmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/14/response-to-lewis-goodall-newsnight-on-local-authority-funding/\">defended</a> as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>A decade of austerity</h2> <p>Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">announced</a> the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-longest-deepest-cuts-ifs\">deepest period of cuts</a> to public service spending since the second world war.</p> <p>Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=60%25&amp;title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"60% cut in local authority funding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=60%25&title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\">60% cut in local authority funding</a> </figure>  <p>It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.</p> <p>Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\">according to the Local Government Association</a>. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\">fell disproportionately</a> on those authorities with the poorest populations.</p> <p>Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=32%2C000&amp;title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\" data-alt=\"32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=32%2C000&title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\">32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09</a> </figure>  <p>Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/\">lost</a> from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour.

Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/never-again\">disruptive top-down reorganisations</a>, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.</p> <p>Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.</p> <p>But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.</p> <p>Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c/0_200_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes.

She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.</p> <p>The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3850m&amp;title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\" data-alt=\"\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A3850m&title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\">\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015</a> </figure>  <p>The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond.

Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> review.</p> <p>During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign.</p> <p>He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d.</p> <h2>Testing time for Public Health England</h2> <p>No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested it had failed</a> to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its&nbsp;emeritus medical director and director for health protection&nbsp;until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.</p> <p>However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/trust-draining-away-over-dangerous-downgrade-ppe-guidance\">unions to accuse</a> it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence. This month, it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/mask-guidance-downgraded-amid-reports-of-failing-stock/7027562.article\">downgraded the type of masks</a> NHS workers should use \u201cas a pragmatic approach for times of severe shortage\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda/0_413_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>PHE disputes that it was slow off the mark, and Selbie points out that it rolled out the details for its first diagnostic test in January, making it \u201cthe fastest deployment of a novel test in recent UK history\u201d. It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages.</p> <p>\u201cOur track record speaks for itself,\u201d a PHE spokesperson said. \u201cDuring 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox. Our flu vaccination programme grows every year and cases of TB have fallen to the lowest level since records began.\u201d They said that far from being invisible, Selbie had been at the coalface, helping to advise government on its decision-making.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson cited a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/661350/PHE-Evaluation_and_Recommendations.pdf\">positive report</a> by the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, which described PHE as a \u201cstrong, capable, coordinated, united and efficient public health agency\u201d. The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A040%25&amp;title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\" data-alt=\"40% cut to PHE operational budget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A040%25&title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\">40% cut to PHE operational budget</a> </figure>  <p>In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.</p> <p>It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.</p> <p>PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.</p> <p>\u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">accused</a> PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.</p> <p>The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.</p> <p>Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d</p> <p>PHE said&nbsp;the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added:&nbsp;\u201cPHE&nbsp;could deal with 5 new cases a week&nbsp;and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and&nbsp;modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d</p> <p>By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.</p> <p>In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9cf7d0-3d11-443e-a156-d111b333fd72\">5,000 confirmed</a> Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">estimated</a> 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.</p> <p>William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d</p> <h2>The elusive 100,000 target</h2> <p>On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">announced</a> a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/\">122 NHS labs</a> in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6/0_49_3529_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.</p> <p>A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.</p> <p>The Guardian soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">received reports</a> from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.</p> <p>In the last week of April, the government <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2425455/\">changed its criteria</a> for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.</p> <p>For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every Thursday at 8pm, millions of Britons have opened their front doors or stood on balconies to applaud the NHS. The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, \u201cwe already have a fantastic NHS, fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d Yet those who have experienced the government\u2019s emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte. Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon. When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said the job would be done with an as\u2013yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft. On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel. The government\u2019s reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic. They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour\u2019s years in power. \u201cThe undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,\u201d said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. \u201cThere has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you\u2019re now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.\u201d Councils left in the dark Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales. Yet Newham\u2019s director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from. \u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point. Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk \u2013 many of them over 70, living alone and isolated. Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up. In addition to the contact-tracing app, the government has once more turned to outsourcing companies, including Serco and Sitel, to recruit and train 25,000 contact tracers. Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate. \u201cContact tracing is a sensitive issue \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people\u2019s local context,\u201d Strelitz said. Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns. Speaking earlier this month he said there was \u201ca huge disconnect\u201d between different branches of government, with some functions of the local public health system having been disabled in recent years. \u201cPeople like environmental health officers, community and neighbourhood teams, youth services workers \u2013 the people who you could deploy in a crisis, who already know where the vulnerable are and how to reach them \u2013 those were the kind of staff they used during 2009 swine flu to work closely with the NHS, but they have been lost,\u201d Harrison said. The Labour leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, said Conservative ministers had spent so many years shrinking the state locally \u201cthey have forgotten what local authorities can do\u201d. Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has defended as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown. A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said. A decade of austerity Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and announced the longest and deepest period of cuts to public service spending since the second world war. Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs. It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze. Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, according to the Local Government Association. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts fell disproportionately on those authorities with the poorest populations. Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population. Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been lost from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour. Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, points out that the number of beds lost is roughly the same as the beds the NHS had to scramble to free up for Covid-19 patients. When the coronavirus spread to Europe earlier this year, the UK ranked 24th among European countries for its numbers of critical care beds, with 6.6 per 100,000 population, compared with Germany, which topped the league with 29.2 per 100,000. NHS fragmentation Two years after Osborne\u2019s announcement, with austerity beginning to bite, the then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, embarked on a complete market-oriented restructuring of the NHS. Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, disruptive top-down reorganisations, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that. Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health. But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said. Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health. \u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes. She said it took her a year to work out where her infectious disease control nurses had gone. \u201cNo one knew and there was no one to ask.\u201d Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, argues it was right for local authorities to have a key role in tackling health inequalities, which tend to relate to people\u2019s living circumstances and socio-economic status. She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards. The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d. The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond. Lord Lansley did too. He told the Guardian that an independent review of the public health changes from 2013 published by the the King\u2019s Fund thinktank in January, \u201cconcluded that they were the right reforms, but were not supported subsequently by the right level of resources\u201d. Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said. The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to the King\u2019s Fund review. During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign. He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d. Testing time for Public Health England No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggested it had failed to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d. Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d. Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its emeritus medical director and director for health protection until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout. However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading unions to accuse it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence. This month, it downgraded the type of masks NHS workers should use \u201cas a pragmatic approach for times of severe shortage\u201d. PHE disputes that it was slow off the mark, and Selbie points out that it rolled out the details for its first diagnostic test in January, making it \u201cthe fastest deployment of a novel test in recent UK history\u201d. It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages. \u201cOur track record speaks for itself,\u201d a PHE spokesperson said. \u201cDuring 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox. Our flu vaccination programme grows every year and cases of TB have fallen to the lowest level since records began.\u201d They said that far from being invisible, Selbie had been at the coalface, helping to advise government on its decision-making. The DHSC spokesperson cited a positive report by the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, which described PHE as a \u201cstrong, capable, coordinated, united and efficient public health agency\u201d. The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d. In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019. It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions. PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme. \u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said. Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, accused PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy. The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test. The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people. Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d PHE said the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added: \u201cPHE could deal with 5 new cases a week and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction \u2013 which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate. In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were 5,000 confirmed Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London estimated 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March. William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d The elusive 100,000 target On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock announced a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with 122 NHS labs in England. Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them. A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies. But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing. The Guardian soon received reports from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours. In the last week of April, the government changed its criteria for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May. For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For as long as she can remember, Jenny Carter has gone to bed late and not woken up until late the following morning, sometimes even the early afternoon. Growing up, she didn\u2019t have a bedtime, and at university she preferred to write her essays between 6pm and 10pm. She loves evenings. They\u2019re when she feels the most creative and can concentrate the best. But that\u2019s not when her employer or society expects her to be productive.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to bed at a \u2018normal\u2019 time feels so unnatural to me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut society just doesn\u2019t cater for people whose sleep cycle doesn\u2019t fit the generic 9 to 5.\u201d She has got into trouble at work for her timekeeping, which has led to disciplinary action. \u201cI\u2019ve had to write off so many events, meetings and opportunities, because they were in the morning and I just knew I wouldn\u2019t be awake.\u201d</p> <p>Carter, 27, an NHS co-ordinator, is an \u201cextreme night owl\u201d, one of an estimated 8.2% of the population whose natural inclination is to fall asleep well after midnight. Left to her own devices, she\u2019d prefer to go to bed around 3am and wake up about noon.</p> <p>She has struggled to organise her life in a way that suits her natural sleeping pattern. She negotiated a slightly later start time at work \u2013 10am \u2013 but wishes she could begin at noon and finish at 8pm. Instead, she deprives herself of sleep during the week and catches up at weekends, when she often sleeps until 3pm.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t what frustrates her most about being a night owl. \u201cI think one of the worst things is people equating night owls and late risers with laziness,\u201d she says. \u201cI am just as productive, enthusiastic and organised as others, but at a different time. Feeling completely out of sync with the rest of society is the hardest thing, like you must be the one that\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a growing body of evidence that suggests it\u2019s society, not night owls like Carter, that is wrong. The field of chronobiology seeks to understand how individuals are driven by an internal clock \u2013 their \u201cchronotype\u201d \u2013 one that is set by genetics, not willpower. The term night owl is shorthand for the chronotype that drives people to go to bed later and rise later. This contrasts with morning larks, who naturally want to go to bed early and wake up early. Most people fall somewhere between the two, with an average sleep cycle running from around 11.30pm until 7.30am. People tend to change over their lifetime. They are larks in childhood, night owls as teens, and more lark-like again as they get older.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"507fb626020d593ce12e30381a636f0688c5c1c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/507fb626020d593ce12e30381a636f0688c5c1c4/0_86_886_978/453.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Say goodbye to your inner farmer.

Experiments show that teens with later school start times achieve better grades, while adults tend to be healthier and more productive when they are allowed to sleep when they want and to work flexibly.</p> <p>So why do night owls exist? There is no single universally accepted theory, but evolutionary biologists think that communities with more variation in chronotypes may have been more likely to survive. If not everyone needs to sleep at the same time, then some members of the tribe can stand guard and protect those who are resting.</p> <p>A recent study of a modern-day hunter-gatherer tribe found that during a three-week period, there were only 18 minutes during which all of the 33 tribe members were asleep simultaneously.</p> <p>Another theory is that variation is simply how genetics works. Colin Espie, professor of sleep medicine at the University of Oxford, says this mirrors differences in hair, eye and skin colour, or height. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like any other biological characteristic. There\u2019s a normal distribution, so there are people on both extremes \u2013 and the majority of people are neither.\u201d</p> <p>Natural night owls<em><strong> </strong></em>are fundamentally different to insomniacs or people who stay up until the early hours because of family or work circumstances. Being a night owl isn\u2019t a problem \u2013 unless you\u2019re trying to fit into a schedule that doesn\u2019t suit your natural cycle.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t always well understood. Jessica Batchelor is a medical writer who feels most productive at 11pm in the evening. \u201cI can\u2019t tell anyone when I went to sleep, woke up, showered, ate a meal, or took a nap without being judged,\u201d she says. \u201cI struggle with feelings of guilt and shame.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re brainwashed to believe that early birds are happier, more successful, more disciplined and all-round better human beings than night owls. The hours when I feel most alive are considered \u2018ungodly\u2019 and likened to a vampire\u2019s schedule. Owls like myself internalise this message, and we believe we must be lazy, depressed and irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>Espie has treated night owls who want to adapt their sleeping patterns. He does this by asking night owls to gradually shift their sleeping pattern earlier, usually by 15 minutes or half an hour per week, through doses of bright light in the morning. This causes the brain to shut down the production of melatonin, the hormone that causes sleepiness. In the evening, night owls must make their bedrooms as dark as possible.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take quite some weeks to shift the body clock, but that way you have the best chance of shifting it for a decent amount of time,\u201d Espie says. \u201cYou\u2019re unlikely to convert an extreme night owl to a morning person, but you can help them get to a middle ground.\u201d</p> <p>Espie\u2019s approach is similar to that advocated by academics at three universities whose research received widespread media coverage last year. They showed that night owls can \u201cretrain\u201d their body clocks through lifestyle adjustments, including exercise and meals at set times, combined with light exposure.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that night owls can easily adjust. Many think that the ideal solution for night owls is to find work that better suits their natural rhythm. For some, this may be shift work, while others opt for flexible employment, such as setting up their own business or freelancing.</p> <p>This is Mary McCleod\u2019s experience. She left her role as a fashion buyer, working 9am to 5pm, to start up her own business selling natural soaps, working 11am until 3pm, then again between 8pm and 1am. \u201cWhen I was going into the office for 9am I would find my mornings would be fairly unproductive and I would tend to stay late to get my \u2018good\u2019 work done, so overall I was missing out on other activities in my day,\u201d she says. \u201cI love working to a schedule that suits me better.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah Edwards, who runs her cake business after her children have gone to bed, agrees. \u201cI am absent-minded and easily distracted during the day,\u201d she says. \u201cStaying up late to get work finished is never a chore or a challenge \u2013 when everyone else is tired I\u2019m just getting going. It means my productivity, creativity and output levels are then incredibly high compared to others who have nothing left in the tank.\u201d</p> <p>Flexible work schedules are currently not the norm, but sleep experts believe they should be. For 15 years, Camilla Kring has run <a href=\"https://www.b-society.org/\" title=\"\">B Society</a>, which advises companies around the world on how to implement \u201cchronoleadership\u201d \u2013 the idea that they should adapt their work patterns to suit the sleeping schedules of their employees, rather than the other way around.</p> <p>While morning larks equally benefit from being allowed to arrive at work early and leave early, Kring feels that the battle is hardest for night owls, who experience more stigma. Many night owls say they receive sarcastic comments from colleagues about being lazy when they arrive at work later, even when they stay late to compensate.</p> <p>This mentality is rooted in our agrarian past, when farm work had to begin at dawn, she says, since people who slept in were unable to provide for their families. These ingrained belief systems are evidenced through aphorisms that span cultures, such as \u201cthe early bird catches the worm\u201d. Kring thinks that they no longer apply to the modern world: \u201cWe should say goodbye to our inner farmer \u2013 we don\u2019t have to get up with the cows any more.\u201d</p> <p>Equally, Kring views the idea that everyone should be in the office at the same time as a hangover from the industrial revolution, when most people worked in factories. \u201cIt\u2019s this mentality of \u2018I see you therefore you\u2019re working,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case when you\u2019re a knowledge worker. It\u2019s more about the quality of your work than how much you\u2019re working.\u201d</p> <p>For night owls,<em><strong> </strong></em>the expectation that they should adapt their behaviours can also be frustrating outside work. Lisa Akker, who is 60, has been a night owl her whole life and thinks the tendency runs in her family. \u201cIt\u2019s caused problems in my marriage. My husband doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t change my sleep times so I can be more of a lark. My cousin is always making fun of my sleeping late proclivity; she\u2019s the quintessential illustration of the early bird getting the worm, and prizes that.\u201d</p> <p>Some night owls say that they deliberately schedule emails to send in the morning or avoid texting friends at night for fear of judgment. Akker said she recently messaged a friend at 11.19pm to ask about her coronavirus recovery. \u201cI texted her, saying: \u2018I know you\u2019ll answer me tomorrow, but I just wanted to know how you are.\u2019 She responded at 8am: \u2018Wow, our sleep schedules are so different!\u2019 And the purpose of saying that is? Jeez, it was only 11.19pm.\u201d</p> <p>The prevalence of this attitude is especially surprising when you consider that in society we are all becoming more nocturnal. Till Roenneberg, the circadian biologist who developed the <a href=\"https://www.thewep.org/documentations/mctq\" title=\"\">Munich ChronoType Questionnaire</a>, used to determine whether we are night owls or morning larks, says that because we are exposing our bodies to less natural light than before, we are shifting our body clocks later.</p> <p>\u201cThe biological clock evolved to get a lot of light during the day and get none after night, because we didn\u2019t have electrical light,\u201d Roenneberg says. \u201cIn the past, the distribution of larks and owls was much narrower. If you couldn\u2019t fall asleep in those days until 2am and would routinely sleep until 10am you were probably an outlier, or you were sick.\u201d</p> <p>This is why, according to Roenneberg, it\u2019s now the norm for people to use alarm clocks. He coined the term \u201csocial jetlag\u201d to refer to the mismatch between most people\u2019s body clocks and the schedules imposed on them by society. \u201cThere is practically no health factor that has been looked at that does not become worse with increasing social jetlag.\u201d</p> <p>Roenneberg\u2019s vision of an ideal society would see nobody use an alarm clock: \u201c[People] would fall asleep when they\u2019re tired and wake up when they have slept to the biological end.\u201d</p> <p>So if all the<em><strong> </strong></em>scientific evidence<em><strong> </strong></em>supports the idea of flexible schedules aligned with our individual sleeping patterns, why aren\u2019t we there yet?

Yet this belies a glaring inconsistency: around eight hours of good-quality sleep is essential for better health for almost everybody.</p> <p>But Professor Espie thinks the tide is turning. When he first qualified as a doctor 40 years ago, exercise, smoking and diet weren\u2019t taken seriously by the medical profession. \u201cNo self-respecting doctor would run clinics encouraging people to lose weight or get fit,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve been advocating for sleep and it\u2019s been falling on deaf ears.

      "bodyText": "For as long as she can remember, Jenny Carter has gone to bed late and not woken up until late the following morning, sometimes even the early afternoon. Growing up, she didn\u2019t have a bedtime, and at university she preferred to write her essays between 6pm and 10pm. She loves evenings. They\u2019re when she feels the most creative and can concentrate the best. But that\u2019s not when her employer or society expects her to be productive. \u201cGoing to bed at a \u2018normal\u2019 time feels so unnatural to me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut society just doesn\u2019t cater for people whose sleep cycle doesn\u2019t fit the generic 9 to 5.\u201d She has got into trouble at work for her timekeeping, which has led to disciplinary action. \u201cI\u2019ve had to write off so many events, meetings and opportunities, because they were in the morning and I just knew I wouldn\u2019t be awake.\u201d Carter, 27, an NHS co-ordinator, is an \u201cextreme night owl\u201d, one of an estimated 8.2% of the population whose natural inclination is to fall asleep well after midnight. Left to her own devices, she\u2019d prefer to go to bed around 3am and wake up about noon. She has struggled to organise her life in a way that suits her natural sleeping pattern. She negotiated a slightly later start time at work \u2013 10am \u2013 but wishes she could begin at noon and finish at 8pm. Instead, she deprives herself of sleep during the week and catches up at weekends, when she often sleeps until 3pm. But this isn\u2019t what frustrates her most about being a night owl. \u201cI think one of the worst things is people equating night owls and late risers with laziness,\u201d she says. \u201cI am just as productive, enthusiastic and organised as others, but at a different time. Feeling completely out of sync with the rest of society is the hardest thing, like you must be the one that\u2019s wrong.\u201d There\u2019s a growing body of evidence that suggests it\u2019s society, not night owls like Carter, that is wrong. The field of chronobiology seeks to understand how individuals are driven by an internal clock \u2013 their \u201cchronotype\u201d \u2013 one that is set by genetics, not willpower. The term night owl is shorthand for the chronotype that drives people to go to bed later and rise later. This contrasts with morning larks, who naturally want to go to bed early and wake up early. Most people fall somewhere between the two, with an average sleep cycle running from around 11.30pm until 7.30am. People tend to change over their lifetime. They are larks in childhood, night owls as teens, and more lark-like again as they get older. These preferences have a huge influence on health and wellbeing. Experiments show that teens with later school start times achieve better grades, while adults tend to be healthier and more productive when they are allowed to sleep when they want and to work flexibly. So why do night owls exist? There is no single universally accepted theory, but evolutionary biologists think that communities with more variation in chronotypes may have been more likely to survive. If not everyone needs to sleep at the same time, then some members of the tribe can stand guard and protect those who are resting. A recent study of a modern-day hunter-gatherer tribe found that during a three-week period, there were only 18 minutes during which all of the 33 tribe members were asleep simultaneously. Another theory is that variation is simply how genetics works. Colin Espie, professor of sleep medicine at the University of Oxford, says this mirrors differences in hair, eye and skin colour, or height. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like any other biological characteristic. There\u2019s a normal distribution, so there are people on both extremes \u2013 and the majority of people are neither.\u201d Natural night owls are fundamentally different to insomniacs or people who stay up until the early hours because of family or work circumstances.

By Thursday, it was nearly gone, and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd\u2019s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Walz added that it <strong>was people of color who were being hit the hardes</strong>t when the protests turn to violence and looting.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses that took decades to build.

At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s morning on the east coast of the US and we\u2019ve started up a fresh blog to keep track of developments on Sunday. You can read it here: Authorities in Minneapolis deployed the National Guard on Saturday to deal with protests and riots in the city, determined to avoid the scenes of looting and destruction from the night before. Their tactics were aggressive, as this video below shows, with guardsmen marching through residential neighbourhoods ordering people to go inside their homes \u2013 and firing non-lethal rounds at them if they failed to comply. This footage, not usually the kind associated with American cities, is being widely shared. Reuters is the latest media outlet to report its staff were attacked by police last night. They\u2019ve just posted this story: Two members of a Reuters TV crew were hit by rubber bullets and injured in Minneapolis on Saturday night when police moved into an area occupied by about 500 protesters in the southwest of the city shortly after the 8 p.m. curfew. Footage taken by cameraman Julio-Cesar Chavez showed a police officer aiming directly at him as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowd. \u201cA police officer that I\u2019m filming turns around points his rubber-bullet rifle straight at me,\u201d said Chavez. Minutes later, Chavez and Reuters security advisor Rodney Seward were struck by rubber bullets as they took cover at a nearby gas station. On footage captured as they ran for safety, several shots are heard ringing out and Seward yells, \u201cI\u2019ve been hit in the face by a rubber bullet.\u201d Asked about the incident, Minneapolis Police Department spokesman John Elder requested a copy of the video and made no immediate comment. Chavez, one of the journalists, has posted pictures of his injuries. Rioting appears to be ongoing and intense in the Californian city of La Mesa, close to San Diego. A curfew has been imposed but at least two banks and a fire truck have now been set on fire, local media is reporting, with unverified footage on social media indicating the damage may be far more extensive. A police officer in the city was put on leave two days ago after footage emerged of him detaining an African American man after twice shoving him onto a bench. The officer claimed he was arresting the man for assault, but there\u2019s no evidence of that on the video that was posted to Instagram this week and quickly amassed more than half a million views. We\u2019re getting more information now from Indianapolis, where police are saying three people were shot, one fatally, after peaceful protests there turned violent on Saturday night. Earlier reports had only mentioned the one fatal shooting. It\u2019s still unclear who fired the weapons but police say their officers were not involved. The Indianapolis Star reported six people were arrested on Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major American cities including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. Hello, it\u2019s Michael Safi taking over from Sam Levin. It\u2019s 3.55am on the US east coast and 12.55am on west coast, and I\u2019ll be steering you through the next hours as protests appear to quiet down across the country - but continue in parts of Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Sacramento and San Diego. One among the many disturbing features of the unrest of recent days has been attacks on journalists covering the protests and riots. The latest to surface is from Oakland, California, where reporter and photographer Sarah Belle Lin was shot with a paintball round as she was filming protesters running from police. She says she was wearing press accreditation and clearly had her camera out. \u201cI confronted the line of police to inquire who had shot me and why. No one provided me with an identity,\u201d she says. You can see footage of the incident at the end of the video below. Lin says she\u2019s okay and was able to get home. We\u2019ve collated accounts of journalists being injured and attacked by police tonight in Minneapolis and other US cities here. It\u2019s now just past midnight in California, and I\u2019m signing off here in Los Angeles. Here\u2019s where things stand and some key updates and links from the day of unrest across the US: There are curfews in place in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Seattle, Miami, Cleveland, Columbus, Portland, Milwaukee and Salt Lake City, as protests continued late into the evening. Governors activated their state national guards in Colorado, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. Protests stayed on the streets in Minneapolis after the curfew, and police responded with more teargas and rubber bullets. The unrest came to Donald Trump\u2019s doorstep as protesters clashed with the Secret Service and police outside the White House for the second successive day. Police have made an estimated total of 1,400 arrests around the country during the protests, though the number is likely higher, according to an AP tally. Some of the protests and clashes seemed to start calming down later into the night, while looting and fires continued. In New York City, a video of two police vehicles driving through protesters blocking a road quickly went viral. Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the action of the police driving the cars, further angering New Yorkers. Several journalists reporting on the protests in Minneapolis on Saturday were injured and teargassed as police worked to impose an evening curfew, just a day after a CNN reporter in the city was arrested live on air. Trump further ignited tensions, lashing out at \u201canarchists\u201d he blamed for stoking the deadly unrest and urging the Minneapolis mayor to act more forcefully against demonstrators. George Floyd\u2019s brother urged police to arrest and charge the three other officers present, and said Trump was brief in a call with him: \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the opportunity to even speak.\u201d Tim Arvier, a US correspondent for Nine News Australia, reporting on the ground in Minneapolis, tweeted that he was \u201cdetained and searched\u201d by police. Officers allegedly handcuffed his cameraman and security, but have since let them go: More from journalists on the ground in Minneapolis: One person was killed and two other were shot during protests in downtown Indianapolis, according to a late-night announcement from police chief, Randal Taylor. Officials did not have details on the person who died, any suspects, or the injuries of others shot, the Indianapolis Star reported. The circumstances of the shooting remained largely unclear, though Taylor said police had not fired the shots and were not injured. Police made arrests and deployed teargas during the night, and there were ongoing reports of looting. There have been a number of new accounts of journalists in Minneapolis getting injured and attacked by police after trying to get out of the way, attempting to follow their order and making clear that they are reporters. Ryan Faircloth, a reporter for the Star Tribune, said officers blew out his car window with some kind of rubber bullet, writing, \u201cThe glass shattered into my face and body. I\u2019m bleeding from the side of my face and down my left arm.\u201d He said he was trying to get out of the area when officers fired on his car, causing glass to explode and his vehicle to fill with smoke. Michael Anthony Adams, a reporter with Vice in Minneapolis, tweeted a video that captured him repeatedly shouting that he was press and showing his press ID, at which point an officer forced him on the ground and another one pepper-sprayed him in the face: And here\u2019s more from a Los Angeles Times reporter, whose story of being teargassed we covered earlier: State police did not respond to a request for comment on the treatment of journalists. The mayor of San Francisco has just announced a curfew, effective immediately until 5am. London Breed also said the National Guard is on standby: The late-night announcement came just as California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, where police have been attempting to enforce a curfew on protesters. The National Guard has already been deployed to LA and the surrounding areas. There are also ongoing reports of looting in Emeryville, near Oakland, where there are a number of chain outlets, including Target, Marshalls, Ross, Best Buy and Guitar Center. Target announced today that it was temporarily closing a number of stores due to the protests, including a wide range throughout Minnesota, California, Texas and New York. The Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao, reporting from New York, on the mayor\u2019s controversial late-night statements: Mayor Bill de Blasio took to the podium on Saturday night to tell protestors across the city that they were \u201cheard, loud and clear\u201d. But the response from some New Yorkers made it clear that they felt otherwise. Over the course of two days, thousands of protesters swarmed through the streets of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens \u2013 holding signs, wearing masks and stopping traffic \u2013 to call for justice for the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd, and the countless other black men and women at the hands of the police. The protests were angry yet largely peaceful, but several videos and documentation of police arresting minors, brutalizing protesters and at one point, driving their car into crowds, surfaced as well. One woman was filmed being pushed over by cops, before she went into a seizure and was taken to the hospital. In response, de Blasio\u2019s main message appeared to be to keep the NYPD safe, and that violence against the police would not be tolerated. He told people they had made their point and should go home, and blamed the agitation on outsiders coming to the city. Notably, de Blasio responded to questions about the police vehicle driving into protestors with a flippant, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d and complained about damaged vehicles. The speech was a stark departure from Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who described how she felt when she watched Floyd\u2019s killing, saying she \u201churt like a mother would hurt\u201d in a speech to her city, or Muriel Bowser, the DC mayor, who called out Donald Trump for hiding \u201cbehind his fence afraid\u201d and said she stood with the people exercising their first amendment right. De Blasio sounded little like the mayor of a city with a long and bloody history of officers brutalizing people of color. His promise of change was vague and unemotional, and tucked away in the litany of patronizing rhetoric toward city protesters. Some New Yorkers on Twitter slammed his livestream, and called on him to resign. Meanwhile, sirens still blazed throughout Brooklyn, where he was giving the speech, as small fires were set in trash cans. New Yorkers are planning to protest again tomorrow in Queens. US prosecutors have filed federal charges against three people in New York, accusing them of using \u201cmolotov cocktails\u201d on New York police vehicles during the Friday protests: The three were \u201cusing and attempting to use improvised incendiary devices\u201d to target police cars, prosecutors alleged in a press release. They were arrested early Saturday morning and will have to make an initial appearance before a judge on Monday. Two of the defendants are accused of throwing a molotov cocktail at an unoccupied, parked police car, and the third allegedly threw something at a car with multiple officers inside, shattering the windows. The announcement did not suggest officers were injured. Presidential candidate Joe Biden has released a late-night statement on the protests that continue late into the night in cities across America: The presumptive Democratic nominee condemned protests that lead to \u201cdestruction\u201d: Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance. The US cities that currently have curfews in place are Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Miami, Cleveland, Columbus, Portland, Milwaukee and Salt Lake City. NBC has a helpful summary of the curfews and the potential consequences for violations: And governors have activated their state national guards in Colorado, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. The New York police department is facing intense backlash over footage showing one of its officers drive into a crowd of demonstrators in Brooklyn: Another angle: New York\u2019s mayor Bill de Blasio defended the police\u2019s actions in a late-night press conference just now, with comments that are also sparking outrage: De Blasio blamed the protesters, saying they were \u201ctrying to hurt police\u201d and \u201ctrying to damage their vehicles\u201d: It\u2019s inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers. That\u2019s wrong on its face. ... I\u2019m not going to blame officers who were trying to deal with an absolutely impossible situation ... They didn\u2019t start the situation. The situation was started by a group of protesters.\u201d Guardian reporters Lois Beckett and Maanvi Singh are reporting from Oakland, California, protests where there is a large presence of officers. So far, it appears calmer than yesterday, although it\u2019s still early. Protests are continuing in Minneapolis despite the curfew and ongoing firing of teargas and rubber bullets, according to our Chris McGreal, still reporting on the ground: Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 US cities in protests over the killing of George Floyd, which have continued across the country late into Saturday evening. That\u2019s according to an Associated Press tally, which found at least 1,383 arrests since Thursday, though the number is likely much higher at this point as arrests continue into the evening. Two journalists were also apparently arrested in New York today during the protests. HuffPost journalist Chris Mathias, who has been live-tweeting from the demonstrations, was taken into NYPD custody in an arrest that was photographed: HuffPost said he was jailed \u201cwhile doing his job as a journalist\u201d and demanded his immediate release. The New York attorney general said she was looking into it. Keith Boykin, a CNN commentator, said he was arrested in Manhattan while taking photos and video. He said he told police he was with the press, and that they \u201cthen turned around and arrested me\u201d. He said he was charged with \u201cwalking on the highway\u201d and \u201cdisorderly conduct - blocking vehicular traffic\u201d, adding that the road was already obstructed by law enforcement and protesters and that he was taking photos. The NYPD has not yet commented on the arrests. The California national guard is deploying to Los Angeles tonight, the mayor has just announced. A curfew in LA began at 8pm local time and covers the entire city. An hour before it began, residents received an emergency \u201cpublic safety alert\u201d that said the curfew would last until 5.30am, but added, \u201cTraveling to and from work, seeking or giving emergency care, and emergency responders are exempt.\u201d The curfew follows a day of intense unrest and large demonstrations in LA where police fired teargas, rubber bullets and used other aggressive tactics. The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state\u2019s capital. Thousands were involved in a peaceful protest there in the afternoon, but clashes erupted after night fell, the AP reported. Demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a former lawmaker and newspaper publisher known for racist views, according to the Tennessean, a local newspaper. By evening, police declared the protest unlawful and began deploying teargas. The governor has also activated the National Guard. In Minneapolis, police have continued to fire rubber bullets on protesters out past the curfew, according to our Chris McGreal, who remains at the scene. He said riot police are attempting to surround the demonstrators who are fleeing: Multiple journalists on the ground in Minnesota said they were teargassed and subject to other attacks by police on Saturday evening, a day after the widely condemned arrest of a CNN reporter live on air. Molly Hennessy-Fiske, a Los Angeles Times journalist, who was reporting outside the fifth precinct in Minneapolis, said she was with a group of roughly a dozen journalists when the Minnesota state patrol \u201cfired teargas canisters on us at point blank range\u201d. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Where do we go?\u2019 They did not tell us where to go. They didn\u2019t direct us. They just fired on us,\u201d she said on video, adding that she was hit in the leg. She posted a video on Twitter from inside a building where she took shelter after police cornered her and others. She said the group clearly identified themselves as journalists. The MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi said he was also hit in the leg by a rubber bullet, adding, \u201cState police supported by national guard fired unprovoked into an entirely peaceful rally.\u201d A photographer with WCCO, a local CBS station, was also arrested on Saturday night, taken into custody by state patrol. The station published video of the arrest, which showed the photographer, Tom Aviles, attempting to follow police\u2019s orders, asking the officers where he should go and repeatedly saying he was with WCCO, until police took him down to the ground and arrested him. Aviles was also hit with a rubber bullet, the station reported, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve called our CBS attorneys, and they\u2019re working on freeing him.\u201d WCCO\u2019s article on the arrest said veteran producer Joan Gilbertson was also with Aviles, and that a patrolmen told her: \u201cYou\u2019ve been warned, or the same thing will happen to you. Or you\u2019re next.\u201d Gilbertson picked up Aviles\u2019 camera and recorded what happened. State patrol did not immediately comment on their claims. In Los Angeles, at least two reporters also said they were hit by police while covering the demonstrations. Trump, who has been largely silent in recent hours, is back on Twitter, with a partisan attack on the mayor of Minneapolis and praising the work of the national guard: Minnesota, like a number of states across the country with large demonstrations, has activated the state national guard. He also tweeted praise for New York police officers, saying they \u201cmust be allowed to do their job!\u201d Tensions have escalated in New York throughout the day, and police have reported making two dozen arrests on Saturday night. In Times Square, officers in riot gear adopted an aggressive approach to push protesters back. The president has been widely condemned in recent days for his divisive and partisan comments and his violent language on social media. On Saturday, he suggested that leftwing groups were responsible for the violence \u2013 a claim which was unsubstantiated. An update on the situation in Seattle, where police say AR-15-style rifles were stolen, from the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe: Tensions and violence are flaring again in Seattle, where the Washington state governor, Jay Inslee, has sent 200 national guard troops to the city center to assist local law enforcement in trying to disperse protestors. TV news channel KOMO broadcast images of vehicles on fire in downtown, and reported that the Seattle mayor, Jenny Durkan, had issued an emergency order including a curfew until Sunday night. But thousands of protesters remained in the city after nightfall, and the AP said the Washington state patrol had closed Interstate 5 in both directions downtown. The violence followed a mostly peaceful daytime rally at the city\u2019s Westlake Park. Several police vehicles were set alight as protesters left the park. They were later dispersed by riot police using flash bang devices and pepper spray. In a worrying development, Seattle city officials said two police AR-15-style rifles were stolen from police. One was recovered but the whereabouts of the other is unknown. The unrest has come to Donald Trump\u2019s doorstep as protesters clash with the Secret Service and police outside the White House for the second successive day. Chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d, hundreds of demonstrators have circled the White House grounds, which have come to resemble a fortress more than at any time in recent memory. Armoured Secret Service, along with District of Columbia police and Park Police, lined up in front of the protesters, forming a barricade as the US president returned to the White House from a trip to Florida. Lafayette Square, the park in front of the executive mansion, has been sealed off with steel barriers. On Saturday evening, protesters overcame the barriers and entered the park but were driven out by police wielding shields, batons and pepper spray. Demonstrators damaged several Secret Service vehicles and threw themselves against officers\u2019 riot shields, the Washington Post reported. As the night wears on, tensions appear to be rising. Police fired teargas just before 10pm, according to Ellie Hall, a BuzzFeed News reporter: Trump has done little to calm the situation. He warned that if protesters had breached the White House fence they would \u201chave been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u201d. Earlier, marchers halted between the Washington Monument and Smithsonian National Museum of African American History for a nine-minute silence \u2013 recognising the nine minutes that a Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck. More from Chris McGreal in Minneapolis, who says state police in riot gear are moving in aggressively on protesters who appear peaceful, but are out past curfew: State leaders have attempted to portray the demonstrations as the work of outside agitators, but the reality is much more complex, according to Chris, who has been talking to local protesters: Historic scenes across the country: Less than an hour into Minneapolis\u2019 curfew, the situation is already dramatically escalating, according to our reporter Chris McGreal, who is on the ground. Police have already deployed flash bangs, teargas and rubber bullets: Residents in several Minneapolis communities have set up barricades anticipating tensions this evening. Some said they have little confidence in authorities to keep the calm. Ron Brown organized a barricade to seal off his street just a couple of blocks from where some of the most serious clashes happened in recent nights. \u201cI want to make sure my community is safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have no type of confidence whatsoever in the cops to protect us, or the government. They just gave up on us. They don\u2019t care. If anyone comes this way we\u2019ll look after ourselves.\u201d Brown, 22, stood with half a dozen other young men from the street. At every street corner for blocks around, similar makeshift barricades were thrown up using bollards, commandeered roadworks signs and fencing reflecting a widespread collapse in confidence among residents that the authorities will protect them if the violence mostly directed at businesses so far spills the short way into residential neighbourhoods. The city of Los Angeles is temporarily shutting down Covid-19 testing sites in response to the escalating protests against police brutality. The mayor, Eric Garcetti, said late Saturday afternoon he would be closing the facilities \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d. He did not specify how long the sites would remain closed or what the specific safety concerns were. Garcetti also adopted a curfew for the city following a night of tense demonstrations. Los Angeles remains the primary hotspot for coronavirus cases in California, and the county announced 2,112 new cases and 48 deaths on Saturday. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal is outside the 5th precinct in Minneapolis, where tense scenes unfolded last night: There are hundreds of people here, and the crowds are growing rapidly. The protests here are a real symbol of defiance. Demonstrators are clearly not obeying the curfew. The message going round here among protesters is to keep it peaceful, until the security forces don\u2019t. The crowd is diverse and racially mixed. Lots of people have made it here on bikes, suggesting they\u2019ve come from nearby. A number of protesters told me they\u2019re from Minneapolis, and not, as authorities have suggested, from outside of the state. From the Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao reporting from Brooklyn: Tensions are running high at the 84th precinct in downtown Brooklyn, where police were expecting hundreds of protesters to storm the building. So far, demonstrators have walked passed the precinct onto the Manhattan bridge, where they\u2019re being stopped by authorities. The curfew is now in effect in Minneapolis, where officials have sent an emergency alert to residents\u2019 phones, telling them to \u201cgo home\u201d and reminding them the policy is \u201cenforceable\u201d. Chants of \u201cfuck the curfew!\u201d broke out when locals received the text: The Minnesota department of public safety has used increasingly aggressive language to try and discourage people from demonstrating, warning that the police force will be tripling in size and that authorities are preparing for \u201ca sophisticated network of urban warfare\u201d. The department has also claimed that police expect \u201crioters\u201d to use \u201cdeadly force\u201d and use \u201ccivilians as shields from law enforcement and distractions\u201d. The department did not elaborate on these claims. From the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe in Miami: Police unleashed tear gas rounds and rubber bullets in Miami as protesters who closed down the I95, the city\u2019s busiest highway, began hurling bottles and rocks and set a police vehicle on fire. Unlike other cities where vehicles were left to burn, officers in riot gear quickly cleared the demonstrators, allowing fire crews to put out the blaze. Nightfall brought a change of atmosphere and a swelling in numbers of the hundreds who had earlier attended peaceful marches along the I95 and at Miami police headquarters in downtown. Earlier in the day, police chiefs and officers came out of the building to show solidarity with the protestors by taking a knee on the steps of the front entrance. Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, blamed \u201celements\u201d of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation for what he called an assault on Minneapolis. Black community leaders suggested the destruction was led by white supremacists and anarchists intent on destroying the state. But if alien revolutionaries could be found among the huge crowds who tore apart shops and businesses along a two-mile stretch of southern Minneapolis following the police killing of George Floyd, there were also plenty of people driven by nothing more than visceral anger and opportunism. The narrative of outside agitators stirring up trouble was not without truth. Young white people dressed in black, who at times did not seem to know their way around the city, were among the most aggressive with the police. They worked in groups, and spray-painted the most political graffiti, beyond the calls for justice for George Floyd or the ubiquitous \u201cFuck the police\u201d. But blaming ideological agitators is also politically convenient, not least because Walz was severely embarrassed by the failure of the police and national guard to enforce a curfew he said would end the destruction. It is also untrue. Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has now activated the state\u2019s national guard, saying \u201cviolence and looting will not be tolerated\u201d: A number of people at the Los Angeles protest, which has continued to intensify, have accused the police of escalating the conflicts this afternoon. Here\u2019s Westworld star Tessa Thompson: Black Lives Matter LA said the police department has been \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cbrutal\u201d today and has failed to show restraint. Earlier, the mayor, Eric Garcetti, said the city would always protect \u201cAngelenos\u2019 right to live without fear of violence or vandalism\u201d, and that it was implementing a curfew. Trump is postponing the G7 summit from June to possibly September, the president just told reporters on Air Force Once. He also said he wants to add Russia, Australia, South Korea and India to the leaders\u2019 summit. Earlier in the day, German chancellor Angela Merkel said she could not commit to attending a June summit in Washington DC due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis here. Police cars are burning across America. Here are a few recent images: In New York, federal prosecutors are filing charges against multiple people accused of being involved in \u201cMolotov cocktail incidents\u201d, according to law enforcement officials. Police allege that one Molotov cocktail was thrown at a van with four officers inside, but have not yet released details about the prosecution. Tense standoffs between police and demonstrators are continuing in Brooklyn today: George Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise, said on MSNBC that his conversation with Trump was brief: \u201cIt was so fast. He didn\u2019t give me the opportunity to even speak. It was hard. I was trying to talk to him but he just kept like pushing me off like \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201d He also said his brother\u2019s killing was a \u201cmodern-day lynching in broad daylight\u201d and that officer Derek Chauvin should face first-degree murder charges, not third-degree charges. He echoed the calls for the remaining three officers to be charged and arrested, and said all four should face the death penalty. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a person to them, he was scum, he was nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need them on the streets to kill anybody else.\u201d Watch more here: The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has sent more than 1,500 state troopers to a number of cities in the state in response to the ongoing protests, including Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. In Houston, nearly 200 people were arrested yesterday for \u201cobstructing a roadway\u201d after demonstrators took over a highway. Hundreds also protested outside police headquarters in Austin today. Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Atlanta have all just announced curfews. The mayor of LA said the city\u2019s curfew will go from 8pm to 5am, an announcement that comes as tensions are already escalating before nightfall while large crowds of demonstrators gather. The details on Philadelphia and Atlanta: The list of governments adopting curfews has grown in recent hours, and now includes Minneapolis, Louisville, Columbia, Denver, Portland, Milwaukee and Columbus. The NFL has released a statement this evening that offers condolences to George Floyd\u2019s family, but does not discuss racism or police brutality. The statement comes days after numerous athletes posted emotional statements about Floyd\u2019s killing, with some referencing the NFL and others\u2019 treatment of Colin Kaepernick when he did peaceful kneeling protests in 2016 to raise awareness about racism in America. From the Guardian\u2019s recent coverage: Most of the people arrested and taken to Hennepin county jail in Minnesota in connection to last night\u2019s riots were residents of the local metro area, according to records reviewed by KARE 11, a local station: This data is noteworthy given that local officials and Donald Trump have presented the protests as riots led by out-of-state residents and agitators. The arrests from the evening tied to the protests were largely for rioting, unlawful assembly and burglary. Here is the data from St Paul: The mayor of Columbus, Ohio has just announced a citywide curfew from 10pm to 6am. Minneapolis, Portland and Louisville have also implemented curfews. Columbus has further closed downtown \u201cindefinitely\u201d: Earlier, multiple elected officials said they were pepper sprayed or maced, including Congresswoman Joyce Beatty: Hi all - Sam Levin, in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage of the protests around the country, which will continue into the evening. Here in southern California, protests have already grown tense and drawn large crowds today, following an evening of clashes and more than 500 arrests. Here\u2019s the current scene in LA: Richard Luscombe has news of Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments on the protests ... Donald Trump says the department of justice is investigating possible civil rights violations in the death of George Floyd. Speaking at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center after this afternoon\u2019s historic SpaceX launch, the president also lashed out at \u201cAntifa and the violent left\u201d whom he blames for protests spreading across the United States. \u201cMy administration has opened a civil rights investigation, I have asked the attorney general and the justice department to expedite it,\u201d Trump said during a 25-minute monologue to space workers that at times resembled one of his pre-coronavirus campaign rallies. \u201cI understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. \u201cThe memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down victims. \u201cRight now, America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, and there will be no anarchy. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities.\u201d After a night in which he threatened protestors at the White House with \u201cvicious dogs and ominous weapons,\u201d Trump appeared to change his tune, painting himself as a supporter of those angered by Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cI stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America justice is never achieved at the hands of an angry mob. I will not allow angry mobs to dominate.\u201d There are large scale protests in Los Angeles this afternoon. The protests started out peacefully in Pan Pacific Park but CNN has shown footage of police cars being vandalised and the police have fired rubber bullets in return. However, the large scale unrest seen last night has not taken place so far in the city. On the east coast, Philadelphia\u2019s mayor has spoken about the pain felt by the black community after the killing of George Floyd, but has appealed for protesters to demonstrate peacefully. \u201cYou should not have to bear witness to the killing of yet another unarmed Black person,\u201d wrote Jim Kenney on Twitter. \u201cYou should not have to feel as though society believes your lives are less valuable than white Americans. And you should not fear for your lives \u2013 or for your loved ones \u2013 when leaving the house ... Please keep each other safe by protesting peacefully, distancing as much as possible, and wearing masks.\u201d The Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, has joined the governors of Wisconsin and Minnesota by calling in the national guard to help oversee the protests over the death of George Floyd. DeWine said he had called in the guard to \u201cdrive out hate and violence, and to instill order\u201d. He added: \u201cSadly there is a relatively small number of violent individuals who pose a specific threat and a real threat to our law enforcement officers and the safety of people in Columbus and Franklin county.\u201d The LA Times has spoken to black Angelenos who witnessed the riots following the police beating of Rodney King in 1992. Many of the people the newspaper interviewed do not believe the situation has improved for people of colour in the nearly 30 years since. \u201cI don\u2019t feel better, and it troubles me to say that,\u201d said Kerman Maddox, who was a reporter during the King riots. \u201cIt\u2019s worse today than it was back then ... Back then, they used to beat the crap out of us, but they didn\u2019t kill us. Now when my 13-year-old son goes to the park, I worry ... is someone going to call the cops on him?\u201d The Guardian spoke to King shortly before his death in 2012 about the weight he carried from the events of 1992. New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has issued a message \u201cparticularly to white New Yorkers\u201d about the death of George Floyd and the subsequent \u201craw pain\u201d the black community has faced. \u201cStructural racism haunts the lives of people of color,\u201d he said in a message posted to Twitter. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is an overflow due to decades of injustices. I see my own privilege and can only understand so much. I know enough to say that for the black community every day is pervaded by racism. We will do better.\u201d De Blasio, whose wife is African American, has spoken in the past about his concerns for his son around law enforcement. Last year, De Blasio said he has had serious talks with his son, Dante, \u201cincluding how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police\u201d. A Fox News reporter was chased by protesters during a demonstration outside the White House on Friday night. Leland Vittert told the Associated Press \u201cwe took a good thumping\u201d from protesters. Vittert said he was not carrying any equipment that identified the organisation he worked for, but several people asked who he was a reporter for. He said one person then found his photo on his phone and told other protesters he was from Fox, which is seen as friendly to Donald Trump. \u201cThe protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,\u201d Vittert said, \u201cand that was a very different feeling\u201d. Vittert said he was followed by a number of people before someone took his microphone and threw it at his back. The incident was captured by a reporter from the Daily Caller. \u201cIt makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We\u2019re going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d The Fox News Media CEO, Suzanne Scott, said journalists should be free to do their job during a time of national crisis. \u201cWe are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,\u201d Scott wrote. A disturbing echo today of the killing of Heather Heyer during the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. At a protest in Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck suddenly accelerated through an intersection filled with protesters. According to ABC27 the truck had initially stopped and was surrounded by protesters who talked to people in the truck. ABC27 then said a punch was aimed at someone in the truck before it accelerated. A video of the incident has appeared on social media and people can be heard screaming in distress as the truck drives through the crowd. \u201cNo one was pulled under the wheels that I saw, but people were definitely hurt,\u201d one witness, Lucas von Hollen, told the Associated Press. \u201cThere was screeching ... People were crying and screaming about how it just drove through the crowd.\u201d The city\u2019s mayor, John E Dailey, said the driver had been taken into custody and no one was seriously injured. \u201cEarlier today an individual struck a crowd of peaceful protestors with their vehicle in downtown Tallahassee at a low rate of speed,\u201d wrote Dailey on Twitter. \u201cThankfully no one was seriously injured. The driver of the vehicle was immediately taken into custody.\u201d The Tallahassee police department said people had the right to protest peacefully. \u201cThis is an extremely tense, emotional time across the nation. Mutual respect among all of us is vital,\u201d the department said in a press release. \u201cThe Tallahassee police department supports the nonviolent gathering of protesters and will uphold their constitutional right to do so while making every effort to maintain a safe environment for our community.\u201d Iran has wasted no time into criticizing its longtime foe over the civil unrest in America. \u201cSome don\u2019t think #BlackLivesMatter,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Twitter. \u201cTo those of us who do: it is long overdue for the entire world to wage war against racism. Time for a #WorldAgainstRacism.\u201d Zarif also referenced a message that the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, sent to Iranian street protesters in 2018, but with some of the words changed. \u201cThe US government is squandering its citizens\u2019 resources, whether its adventurism in Asia, Africa, or Latin America...\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign ministry had earlier condemned the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer. \u201cThe voices of the protesters must be heard ... [and] the repression of suffering Americans must be stopped immediately,\u201d the ministry statement said. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has confirmed her office will investigate the clashes between police and protesters in New York City last night. Police in Brooklyn were seen shoving protesters, and one police van was set alight during Friday\u2019s demonstrations. \u201cPeaceful protest is a basic civil right. That right should be protected and guarded,\u201d said James in a statement. \u201cWe take the designation to investigate last night\u2019s actions very seriously. We will act independently to seek answers, ensure that the truth is laid bare, and that there is accountability for any wrongdoing. We will be transparent in our findings as we seek accountability for those who did wrong.\u201d Meanwhile, thousands of protesters are marching in midtown Manhattan blocking traffic. Boston\u2019s mayor used emphatic language when hosting a prayer vigil to honour the memory of George Floyd. Marty Walsh, who hosted the vigil alongside Boston\u2019s police commissioner, described Floyd\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d. Derek Chauvin, the police officer captured on video kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck before his death, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter but has yet to face trial. Walsh said the vigil was a chance to reflect on Floyd\u2019s \u201cmurder\u201d. Walsh added: \u201cIf there\u2019s ever a moment to acknowledge injustice and recommit our nation to eradicating it, it\u2019s right now ... This is our moment in time to change as a nation.\u201d The capsule carrying the astronauts on the SpaceX mission has successfully separated from its rocket and is now on its way to the International Space Station. The capsules crew of Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will now use thrusters to steer their way to the space station. The journey will take them around 19 hours. Concern has been raised by many people that the demonstrations seen around the US could help spread Covid-19. Many protesters have been seen without masks in packed crowds. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio agreed such scenes were worrying, particularly in a city with tens of thousands of deaths from the virus. \u201cI would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather it\u2019s inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic and I\u2019m going to keep urging people not to use that approach and if they do they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings,\u201d De Blasio told journalists on Saturday. De Blasio said he understood the anger fueling the protests \u201cbut the last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings. It\u2019s a very very complicated reality.\u201d Richard Luscombe in Florida has news on Nasa\u2019s latest mission: The United States is back in the business of human spaceflight after a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon crew capsule carrying two Nasa astronauts blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 3.22pm launch marked the rebirth of the nation\u2019s crewed spaceflight program as the first mission by a private contractor carrying humans into orbit. It was also the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the retirement of Nasa\u2019s space shuttle fleet in 2011. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, both veterans of shuttle missions, will join their Nasa colleague Chris Cassidy already aboard the International Space Station 250 miles above Earth after docking on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely our honor to be part of this huge effort to get the United States back in the launch business,\u201d Hurley said from the flight deck moments before lift-off. Today\u2019s launch was attended by Donald Trump, whose administration has made space a policy priority. This mission is the first crewed test flight for SpaceX, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s company, ahead of planned regular flights to the ISS commencing later this year. Tony Evers is the latest state governor to call in the national guard to help police protesters. The Wisconsin governor said at least 125 members of the state\u2019s national guard have been activated after protests escalated in Milwaukee on Friday night. A police officer suffered a minor gunshot wound in the city early on Saturday morning while near where protesters had gathered. \u201cIt is critical that people are able to peacefully express their anger and frustration about systemic racism and injustice, in Milwaukee, the State of Wisconsin, and our Nation,\u201d said Evers in a press release. \u201cThis limited authorization of citizen soldiers from the Wisconsin National Guard will help protect people who are exercising their First Amendment rights and ensure the safety of the public.\u201d The US attorney general, William Barr, has issued a statement on the civil unrest of the last few days. He started by acknowledging the anger over the death of George Floyd. \u201cThe outrage of our national community about what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis is real and legitimate. Accountability for his death must be addressed, and is being addressed, through the regular process of our criminal justice system, both at the state and at the federal level,\u201d said Barr. However, he also said that \u201cthe greatness of our nation comes from our commitment to the rule of law\u201d before, like Donald Trump, blaming the violence and looting that has taken place in some cities on elements of the left. \u201cIn many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence,\u201d he said. Neither Barr nor Trump has provided any evidence that leftwing groups are responsible for the violence. Barr concluded by saying it was a federal crime to cross state lines to stir up riots. \u201cIn that regard, it is a federal crime to cross state lines or to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting. We will enforce these laws,\u201d he said. In Chicago, protests over the killing of George Floyd continued until 5am on Saturday. There were just over 100 arrests and a dozen officers were injured according to police. \u201cSome in the crowd began confronting the police, so we had to take swift action so that the violence and property damage wouldn\u2019t escalate,\u201d said Supt David Brown. \u201cWe think we hit the right tone as it relates to allowing those who want to express their First Amendment right, and crossing the line to property damage and violence \u2013 we took swift action.\u201d Another demonstration is planned this afternoon, and Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot urged people to protest peacefully. \u201cMy hope is that if there is an additional protest... that the vast majority of people will conduct themselves the way the vast majority of people conducted themselves yesterday, which is peaceful,\u201d Lightfoot said. Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly rebuked Donald Trump, after a few days in which the President of the United States has spoken with apparent relish about the weapons he can turn on his own citizens. \u201cTo make a reference to vicious dogs is no subtle reminder to African Americans of segregationists who let dogs out on women, children, and innocent people in the south,\u201d Bowser said. On Friday, Trump tweeted, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, a phrase with racist origins which was censored by Twitter. Then, on Saturday, the president claimed without evidence that protesters in Washington DC were \u201cprofessionally\u201d organized but had failed to breach the White House perimeter. \u201cIf they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least,\u201d Trump tweeted. Bowser added that Trump\u2019s language was a \u201cglorification of violence against American citizens.\u201d She said that \u201cwhat used to be heard in dog whistles we now hear from a bull horn.\u201d Attorney general William Barr has been speaking in Washington, promising to enforce federal laws against crossing state lines or using inter-state facilities \u201cto incite or participate in violent rioting\u201d. \u201cOutside agitators\u201d have been taking over protests over the death of George Floyd, he says. From the Pentagon, meanwhile, comes news that per Donald Trump\u2019s earlier statements about being willing to use the military against rioters, some US military unites are now on four-hour recall status. The Department of Defense also says Minnesota governor Tim Walz has not requested such support. Walz said earlier today he was mounting the biggest national guard deployment since the second world war. The AP has a fascinating report about military police units being put on alert to go to Minneapolis. It\u2019s here, and here\u2019s a taste: Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act [of 1807, last used in Los Angeles in 1992] offers an exception. The Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute \u201cis deliberately vague\u201d when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state\u2019s governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he\u2019s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can\u2019t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. \u201cIt is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,\u201d he added. It\u2019s getting on for mid-afternoon on the US east coast now, and crowds of protesters are gathering in some cities. Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis for the Guardian, from where he sent this report about Friday night and Saturday morning after. He\u2019s also been out today and seen people attempting to clean up some damage. Here, meanwhile, is a picture from Newark, New Jersey, not far across the Hudson river from New York City, where protests on Friday were mostly in Brooklyn. Here\u2019s some relatively dramatic video from Columbia, South Carolina: A small army of volunteers turned out to clean up several miles of Lake Street in Minneapolis hit by Friday night\u2019s destruction. They lifted debris from restaurants and food stores, a car wash and an electronics shop. Some places were beyond help. The comprehensively plundered liquor store and dozens of places gutted by fire, including a gas station. Entire blocks of shops were razed. A church set up a makeshift stall a block long to distribute free food. Munah Wotorson-Smith grew up in the area. \u201cI had to come out. If we rebuild, we grow,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Malaika Smith, said the clean-up was the true face of the community. \u201cThere\u2019s too much focus on actors in our community that want to promote division. I think what\u2019s important is the story of George Floyd. This is a reaction to something that\u2019s happened,\u201d she said. Asked about whether, as some business owners said, the authorities failed in leaving the rioters a free hand, Smith said they had failed earlier than that. \u201cThe failure is that they didn\u2019t arrest him [the accused police officer in the death of George Floyd] immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was 300 seconds for that man to get off [Floyd\u2019s] neck. The whole world watched it. They could have arrested him immediately and stopped all this.\u201d Wotorson-Smith said the violence was an inevitable consequence of frustration but it could be used to bring about change. \u201cWe have had change since the time of slavery. Civil rights, voting rights. But it came with blood and tears,\u201d she said. Her daughter agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the mindset comes from that there can be peaceful change,\u201d said Smith. Something worth noting in light of Trump\u2019s earlier comments about deploying the military to Minnesota to quell protests: if he sends troops, it would have to be at the invitation of the state\u2019s governor. The Associated Press has more on the story: As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty US military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked the widespread protests. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, afterDonald Trump asked the defense secretary, Mark Esper, for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019 Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. \u201cWhen the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak,\u201d the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. \u201cIf this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,\u201d said Brad Moss, a Washington DC-based attorney, who specializes in national security. The rapper Killer Mike has addressed protesters in Atlanta after a troubled night that saw the city\u2019s college football hall of fame damaged and looted. Killer Mike said that people should \u201cplot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise\u201d for political change but not engage in violence. \u201cYou have a duty not to burn your own house down,\u201d he said. You can hear more of the star\u2019s comments in the video below: Before his departure to Florida, Trump added that the military would be ready to take to the streets of Minneapolis if necessary. \u201cWe have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can have troops on the ground very quickly.\u201d He again added the allegation that the left are behind the violence during protests at the killing of George Floyd. \u201cBecause these people, this Antifa, there\u2019s a lot of radical left bad people, and they\u2019ve got to be taught that you can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. The president added that America should: \u201cHonor the memory of George Floyd.\u201d In a since deleted tweet this morning, Trump appeared to invite his supporters to a counter-protest at the White House tonight, something that could easily flare into violence. When he was asked about the tweet Trump said of any potential counter-protesters: \u201cBy the way, they love African American people, they love Black people.\u201d Donald Trump has spoken to reporters before flying to Florida for the launch of the SpaceX mission. Once again, stoking up political divisions in the US, he blamed protests at the White House on Friday night on the left. He said he was grateful for members of the Secret Service who \u201chandled the Antifa or the radical left incredibly\u201d. The Secret Service said in a statement that six people were arrested on Friday night during the protests. A number of officers were also injured. The statement added that local police were also present, which contradicts an earlier tweet from Trump, who said DC\u2019s mayor had said local law enforcement would not help patrol the demonstrations. Protests in Phoenix on Friday night centered not only on the death of George Floyd, but also that of Dion Johnson, a black man shot dead by police in the city on Monday. Johnson was in a parked car early on Monday morning when a trooper said he became involved in a struggle with Johnson. Police said the trooper was not wearing a body camera and a handgun was recovered at the scene. Johnson\u2019s mother, Erma, said her son would have avoided confrontation with law enforcement. \u201cI want to know where was his body camera? I want to know why did he not call for back up?\u201d she told the Arizona Republic. \u201cIf he was so threatened, why didn\u2019t he call for some backup? It\u2019s a lot of questions that are unanswered. It\u2019s a lot of things that I want to know that happened to my son in the last minutes of his life.\u201d Protesters marched through the city\u2019s streets before stopping at headquarters. For the most part, the demonstration was peaceful before water bottles were thrown at police, who fired rubber bullets in return, according to the Arizona Republic. The protests over George Floyd\u2019s death have spread to European soccer. Weston McKinnie, a star of the US men\u2019s national team, wore an armband reading \u201cJustice for George\u201d during the German Bundesliga match between Schalke and Werder Bremen on Saturday. The 21-year-old\u2019s team tweeted out an image of McKinnie wearing the band with the with hashtag #JusticeForGeorge. McKinnie could not prevent Schalke falling to a 1-0 defeat. A number of sports stars have spoken out over Floyd\u2019s death, including LeBron James, Lewis Hamilton and the No1 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft Joe Burrow. Burrow, one of the few white US sports stars to make a public statement, said that the \u201cblack community needs our help\u201d on Twitter. \u201cThey have been unheard for far too long,\u201d said Burrow, the Heisman Trophy winner from Louisiana State and No 1 overall pick in last month\u2019s NFL draft. \u201cOpen your ears, listen, and speak. This isn\u2019t politics. This is human rights.\u201d Former NBA star Stephen Jackson, was friends with Floyd, who he called his \u201ctwin\u201d. Jackson spoke about his friend\u2019s death on Friday at a rally in Minneapolis. \u201cI\u2019m here because they\u2019re not gonna demean the character of George Floyd, my twin,\u201d Jackson said to onlookers at the Minneapolis City Hall Rotunda. \u201cA lot of times, when police do things they know that\u2019s wrong, the first thing they try to do is cover it up, and bring up your background to make it seem like the bullshit that they did was worthy. When was murder ever worthy? But if it\u2019s a black man, it\u2019s approved.\u201d Around 200 people were arrested during protests in Houston last night, and four police officers were injured, none of them seriously. The protests shut down much of the city\u2019s downtown and Houston police said most of those arrested would be charged with obstructing a roadway. The streets were finally cleared around 4am, according to the Houston Chronicle. George Floyd was originally from the Houston area. The city\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, thanked those who had demonstrated peacefully. \u201cFor those who protested peacefully yesterday, thank you,\u201d said the mayor. \u201cTo our police officers, thank you for showing incredible restraint and professionalism.\u201d A video posted to social media showed a police horse knocking over a protester. Houston police said they are reviewing the incident. \u201cWe are aware of a video circulating showing one of our mounted patrol horses and a citizen. We are currently reviewing the circumstances behind the incident,\u201d the department wrote in a tweet. Cuomo\u2019s press conference has finished. He also said that the families of frontline workers who have died during the Covid-19 pandemic will receive benefits. \u201cIt is my honor to sign into law a bill that gives death benefits to all the frontline workers who gave their lives in service to all of us during this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cProviding for their families is the least we can do.\u201d Cuomo says the attorney general would investigate whether police acted properly during protests in New York City last night. People \u201cdeserve accountability,\u201d he says. \u201cLast night we saw disturbing violent clashes amidst protests right here in NYC, in Brooklyn\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m asking Attorney General James to review the actions and the procedures that were used last night because the public deserves answers and they deserve accountability.\u201d Cuomo also expresses concern that some protesters in New York were not wearing masks. \u201cDemonstrate with a mask on, what\u2019s the difference,\u201d he says. He adds that many young people think they will not suffer from Covid-19, but he points out that they can infect other people, even if they do not suffer themselves. Cuomo attempts to strike a conciliatory note, by appealing to New Yorkers\u2019 \u201cbetter angels\u201d. New Yorkers should \u201cdemand justice\u201d over racial injustice and inequality, he says but should take note of the way people came together to fight Covid-19. He says emergency workers were not \u201cwhite New Yorkers, or black New Yorkers or Latino New Yorkers\u201d. Instead \u201cthey were Americans. They were New Yorkers.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says he understands the \u201coutrage\u201d around the death of George Floyd after clashes between police and protesters in New York City last night. However he said, \u201cviolence obscures the righteousness of the message. The violence allows people to talk about the violence rather than the situation that causes the violence.\u201d He emphasised that racial injustice in the US is very real. \u201cWhen you have one episode, two episodes maybe you can look at them as individual episodes. But when you have 10 episodes, 15 episodes, you are blind or in denial if you are still treating each one like a unique situation,\u201d the governor said. Police reportedly shoved protesters as crowds gathered near the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn on Friday night, while a molotov cocktail was thrown at a police van in nearby streets. Cuomo said the state\u2019s attorney general would look into incidents during the protests. A group of journalists of colour in the UK have written a letter to the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, expressing their concern at the arrest of a CNN reporter covering the Minneapolis protests. Omar Jimenez, who is black, was arrested on Friday morning by around half a dozen white officers who did not initially give a reason for his arrest. The letter to Johnson was signed by a number of high-profile journalists, including the Guardian\u2019s Hugh Muir, Gary Younge and Afua Hirsch. Here\u2019s the letter in full: Dear Ambassador, We are a collection of journalists of colour working in the United Kingdom. Between us we work for every major British broadcaster and numerous news outlets and a range of media. We unreservedly condemn the arrest of our fellow African-American correspondent Omar Jimenez and his fellow crew members including producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez reporting for CNN on the unrest in Minneapolis following the brutal death of the black man George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. While Jimenez and his team were released following the intervention of the president of CNN and the Governor Tim Walz we note that CNN\u2019s white reporter Josh Campbell who was working close by with his team was not arrested. We do not believe this is a coincidence or that the difference in race was incidental. It is crucial that journalists be able to conduct their work without fear of arrest of harassment by officials. It is important that this applies to all journalists irrespective of their race, gender or religion in order for the journalism that is produced to truly reflect the US\u2019s rich diversity. This is even more important when reporting on issues which specifically pertain to the country\u2019s people of colour. We believe that the arrest, seen across the world, sets a worrying precedent for how countries treat journalists, especially ones perceived as coming from racial minorities, and how they can be detained and stopped from doing their important work. In your position as ambassador we seek reassurances that British journalists will be able to work in the US without fear of arrest and that you will do everything in your power to ensure that this potential international precedent is not set. To this end we call on an immediate condemnation of the arrest by the ambassador, and all American officials based in the UK. We also call on an immediate inquiry not only into the arrest of Omar Jimenez but into the treatment of all black journalists and journalists of colour by American authorities. We call on the immediate suspension of the police officers involved in the arrest of Jimenez and his team until this inquiry is complete. We stand in solidarity with Omar Jimenez and all journalists of colour who are reporting on racism in America. Yours sincerely, Marcus Ryder (Acting Chair of the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity) The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, has followed Minnesota\u2019s lead by calling in the National Guard. There have been widescale protests in Louisville this week, caused by the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot by police in March, and Monday\u2019s killing of George Floyd. \u201cThe demonstrations in Louisville have all started peacefully, but what we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets. We cannot let Breonna\u2019s legacy be marred by violence, and we can\u2019t let our streets turn violent,\u201d Beshear said. Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer, said there would be a curfew on Saturday night after unrest on the city\u2019s streets on Friday night, during which six people were arrested. \u201cA very sad night for our city. And as violence raged across many cities in our country, it has been a sad night for America,\u201d said Fischer. The civil right activist Reverend William Barber has written an opinion piece for us on the roots of the civil unrest in America over the last few days. He says underlying issues must be addressed first: No one wants to see their community burn. But the fires burning in Minneapolis, just like the fire burning in the spirits of so many marginalized Americans today, are a natural response to the trauma black communities have experienced, generation after generation. No one wants the fires \u2013 even activists on the ground have said this. But they have also shared how their non-violent pleas and protests have gone unnoticed for years as the situation has gotten out of hand. No one knows who and what is behind the violence, but we do know that countless activists, grassroots leaders and preachers were screaming non-violently long before now: \u201cChange, America! Change, Minneapolis!\u201d Rather than listen, many of those in power saw even their non-violent protest as an unwelcome development. You can read the full article below: Major General Jon A Jensen, the director of the Army National Guard, confirmed the body will have 2,500 personnel mobilised by 12pm today in Minnesota. \u201cThe governor just announced the full mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard for the first time since world war two. What does that mean? It means we\u2019re all in,\u201d Jensen said. Minnesota governor Tim Walz also echoed the belief that many of the protesters in Minneapolis are not from the city. \u201cWhat I would ask today is if you know where these people are sleeping today, let us know and we will execute warrants,\u201d Walz said. \u201cCall that in, tell us who they were. They\u2019re not from Minneapolis, but they\u2019re staying down here.\u201d He added that he believes 80% of the protesters are from outside Minnesota, although did not offer evidence to back that figure up. Walz said he was not giving that figure to hide the fact that inequalities in his state had helped cause the civil unrest in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to deflect in any way,\u201d Walz said. From Washington, Daniel Strauss considers what the George Floyd death and ensuing protests mean for US politics, in the year of perhaps the most consequential presidential election of modern times. (Easy contrasts are available to the election of 1968, when violence raged across the summer and Richard Nixon, standing on a law and order platform which Donald Trump consciously appropriated in 2016, went on to beat Hubert Humphrey for the White House.) Here\u2019s Daniel: Donald Trump and Joe Biden offered divergent responses that point to an even more divisive political debate on race relations and between Democrats and Republicans in the months ahead. The president, in a tweet in the early hours of Friday, warned that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Later on Friday the former vice-president in a video address called for national unity and serious police reform, saying: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d At a press conference in the Rose Garden where the president seemed poised to further address Floyd\u2019s death and the riots, Trump instead announced that the US would withdraw from the World Health Organization. He did not mention the riots or Floyd\u2019s death. Meanwhile, Biden revealed he had already spoken to Floyd\u2019s grieving family and spoke emotionally of the shock at his killing and society\u2019s racial problems. \u201cWe\u2019re a country with an open wound. None of us any longer can hear the words \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and do nothing,\u201d he said. The wildly different responses by the two men battling for the White House under the ongoing cloud of the coronavirus pandemic has left party leaders unsure of what exactly the final months of the presidential election will now look like. Here\u2019s the piece in full: Protests in Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed on Monday, are expected to be even larger today and, as a result, Minnesota governor Tim Waltz has activated more than 1,000 additional members of the National Guard, to go alongside the 700 personnel already on duty yesterday. The Minnesota National Guard said it was the largest deployment in its 164-year history. In a news conference on Saturday, Walz said police had faced explosive devices, and the protests had reached a point where it was a \u201cmockery\u201d to suggest they had anything to do with Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cI think what\u2019s really important to recognize is the tactics and the approach that we have taken have evolved and need to evolve the same way,\u201d said Walz, a Democrat. \u201cWith a sensitivity to the legitimate rage and anger that came after what the world witnessed in the murder of George Floyd, and was manifested in a very healthy gathering of community to memorialize that on Tuesday night. Was still present to a certain degree on Wednesday. By Thursday, it was nearly gone, and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd\u2019s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.\u201d Walz added that it was people of color who were being hit the hardest when the protests turn to violence and looting. \u201cBecause our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses that took decades to build. Infrastructure and nonprofits that have served a struggling community were torn down and burned by people with no regard for what went into that,\u201d Waltz added. At the same press conference,Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, added that he believes most protestors were from outside the city. \u201cOur Minneapolis residents are scared and rightfully so. We\u2019ve seen longterm institutional businesses overridden. We\u2019ve seen community institutions set on fire. And I want to be very, very clear. The people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residents,\u201d he said. Portland is no stranger to protests, so it\u2019s not surprising demonstrations against George Floyd\u2019s death took place in the Oregon city last night. The protests turned violent around 11pm when people broke windows and caused fires at a downtown building housing a jail and police offices. Police later used tear gas, pepper balls and stun grenades to disperse the crowd and shop windows broken and some items stolen. By 4am on Saturday the city\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, had declared a state of emergency. There will also be a curfew in the city tonight. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is flat out breaking the law, violating our community, violating the memory of George Floyd and so many other people on such an important night,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI have had enough. The community has had enough, and I\u2019m telling those individuals go home.\u201d A security officer was killed and another injured last night after a shooting at Oakland\u2019s Federal Building. The incident happened less than half a mile from the city\u2019s police headquarters where a crowd gathered to protest the death of George Floyd. However, Oakland police in a statement that \u201cit appears the shooting is unrelated to tonight\u2019s demonstration.\u201d The demonstration over Floyd\u2019s death started at around 8.30pm and by 9pm police had deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd. Protesters set off fireworks and threw bottles towards police. Windows were broken in downtown Oakland and police used flash bangs, as well as more tear gas, against the protesters. In a since-deleted tweet, Donald Trump appeared to insinuate protesters outside the White House last night were being paid - or at least were directed by professionals. The president is, of course, known for his appetite for baseless conspiracy theories. \u201cThey professionally managed so-called \u2018protesters\u2019 at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey were just their to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily. Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???\u201d As is often the case, it is unclear what the president meant in the final line of his tweet. He is scheduled to fly to Florida today for the SpaceX launch and is due back around 8pm. His words could be interpreted by some as an invitation for a counter-protest, which would be potentially dangerous in the current climate. There was damage and looting at the college football hall of fame last night. Protests over the death of George Floyd started in central Atlanta, where the hall is located. The building front windows were smashed and the gift shop was looted, although it is not known whether anything was taken from the museum, where the hall\u2019s memorabilia is stored. Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, has called in the National Guard to Atlanta and declared a state of emergency. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, condemned the violence and looting. \u201cWhat I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr This is chaos,\u201d Lance Bottoms said. \u201cA protest has purpose. When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn\u2019t do this to our city. If you want change in America, go and register to vote. ... That is the change we need in this country.\u201d The college football hall of fame CEO, Kimberly Beaudin, said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the damage. \u201cWe support the peaceful protests that honor [Floyd\u2019s] memory but unfortunately deteriorated into chaos and disorder,\u201d Beaudin said. \u201cWe are heartbroken to see the damage to our city and the Hall of Fame. As our mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said, we are better than this, better than this as a city, better than this as a country. \u201cIn the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll work to pick up the pieces to rebuild the sacred walls that housed memories and honored those who played the game, many of whom fought these same injustices throughout their storied careers.\u201d Donald Trump is up and tweeting, and he says that had protesters breached the fence at the White House last night, they would \u201chave been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d The president was at home as protesters gathered outside the White House and he commending the US secret service for its job guarding him. But he doesn\u2019t really do calls for calm and unifying rhetoric. Trump, remember, tweeted on Friday \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, was censored by Twitter, then claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory and racist nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens. On Friday night, hundreds of demonstrators gathered across the street from the White House in Lafayette Square. Here\u2019s the AP report: Protesters hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces. By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers. Police did not immediately provide any information about arrests. The president\u2019s Saturday message is also worth quoting in full: \u201cGreat job last night at the White House by the US @SecretService. They were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn\u2019t have felt more safe. \u201cThey let the \u201cprotesters\u201d scream &amp; rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them. The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least. \u201cMany Secret Service agents just waiting for action. \u201cWe put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and good practice.\u201d As you saw last night, they were very cool &amp; very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! \u201cOn the bad side, the DC Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money &amp; help, wouldn\u2019t let the DC Police get involved. \u201cNot their job.\u201d Nice!\u201d So Trump is making a political point at a Democratic authority figure, in this case an African American in a majority African American city, once again. Shimon Prokupecz of CNN has obtained an email sent to FBI employees on Friday night by director Christopher Wray. The president may be using Twitter to make political points around the rioting, against Democrats ahead of the November election, but the man he appointed to replace James Comey at the head of the FBI is insisting US law enforcement must \u201cprotect and serve all citizens who are in custody\u201d. The FBI is part of a justice department civil rights investigation into the death of George Floyd. The investigation is unusually swift \u2013 usually states proceed with charges related to such deaths and if such cases fail, the federal agencies step in. \u201cWhen we fail to honour their rights,\u201d Wray continues, \u201cwe tarnish the badge we wear, we completely erode the trust so many of us \u2026 work so hard to build, particularly within minority communities.\u201d \u201cThe events this past week in Minneapolis,\u201d Wray adds, \u201cclearly illustrate how quickly that trust can be lost.\u201d As Chris McGreal and Kenya Evelyn reported yesterday, \u201cDerek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer captured on video kneeling on the neck of 46-year-old George Floyd as he begged for his life, was charged on Friday afternoon with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The state\u2019s bureau of criminal apprehension took Chauvin, a 19-year veteran, into custody. \u201cWe are in the process of continuing to review the evidence. There may be additional charges later,\u201d the Hennepin county attorney, Mike Freeman, said. Three other officers were involved in an arrest which the public saw from new angles with the release of new video on Friday. Footage appeared to show three officers kneeling on Floyd. An attorney for Floyd\u2019s family welcomed the arrest of Chauvin, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wanted the other officers arrested, too. Other deaths have been reported amid protests, rioting and looting. In St Louis, Missouri, police are investigating after a man was killed after being dragged by a FedEx truck. The Associated Press reports, meanwhile, on a death in Detroit, Michigan: One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of people protesting George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis custody, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11.30pm on Friday near Detroit\u2019s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt Nicole Kirkwood, a police department spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn\u2019t involved in the shooting. Kirkwood said the victim was a 19-year-old man, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. The suspect pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into the crowd, she said. Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of protests in US cities over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who was killed when he was arrested by four Minneapolis police officers and one knelt on his neck. Floyd\u2019s cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d were reminiscent of the 2014 killing in New York of Eric Garner, a case which fuelled the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests. A new wave of such protests has now hit the US, from Minneapolis in the north to Portland on the west coast, from New York and Washington on the east coast to Atlanta in the south. This morning, Minnesota governor Tim Walz has released a statement on Twitter, saying \u201cMinnesotans are asking for and deserve confidence that we can respond to this crisis, and we will. We are continuing to coordinate efforts at the state and local level while accessing resources from across the country to keep our communities safe. I urge for peace at this time.\u201d Here\u2019s the introduction to our main news report, filed by Chris McGreal from Minneapolis and other correspondents: Protests over police brutality and the death of George Floyd ignited once again on Friday, as Minneapolis faced another night of chaos and demonstrators clashed with police in cities across the US. Gatherings were largely peaceful during the day as protesters marched from Los Angeles to New York, but many demonstrations turned volatile as the night wore on. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, protesters ignored an 8pm curfew set by the state\u2019s governor, with thousands pouring on to the streets for a fourth straight night. In Atlanta, protesters set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN\u2019s headquarters, prompting Georgia\u2019s governor to declare a state of emergency. Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the shooting has caused consternation on all sides, many accusing the president of acting only to ratchet up the tension. On Friday, the president tried to excuse his swiftly infamous \u201clooting leads to shooting\u201d tweet, but many saw it as a president inciting violence against American citizens. Trump also expressed his \u201cdeepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd\u201d. Overnight, he turned to electioneering on the back of the protests, riots and looting. For now, as daylight breaks across America on a warm last weekend in May, things are relatively calm. We\u2019ll be here all day with coverage, Tom Lutz taking over from me at 9am ET. In the meantime, here\u2019s some further reading from Tom McCarthy, our national affairs correspondent, on what has changed in six years since the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown \u2026 and what hasn\u2019t:",

      "body": "<p>News on Tuesday that Tyrrells would not be renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier 15s for next season seemed on the face of it a blow for top-flight women\u2019s rugby, but with clubs having been assured that their funding from the Rugby Football Union remains ringfenced, and some in the sport not exactly mourning the crisp manufacturer\u2019s departure, mood at the top of the game remains buoyant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/tyrrells-end-sponsorship-womens-premier-15s-rfu\">Women's rugby at risk of RFU funding cuts after Tyrrells ends sponsorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the former England captain Catherine Spencer welcomed the fact that women\u2019s rugby is now free to find \u201ca more engaged sponsor\u201d that \u201cwants to be linked to sport\u201d. The suggestion is that the sport has grown considerably in the three years since Tyrrells signed up, and thus a different partner is now required.</p> <p>Giselle Mather, director of rugby at Wasps, says: \u201cIt would be a disappointment if we don\u2019t have a title sponsor for the league, but outside of that it doesn\u2019t change a massive amount for me. What I look at won\u2019t be different except for the logos on the post protectors and balls. I see it as a massive opportunity for a new sponsor, who is inheriting a product much better than the one we started with.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the close of a chapter to go to the next one. Tyrrells didn\u2019t do all the things they could have done to promote the game but they gave us a title sponsor, they gave us the start and enabled us to crack on and get the product right. Now we need a sponsor that does come to games, does get the grassroots coming in, get the women coming in so the game really builds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atlanta St John, the head of Harlequins\u2019 women\u2019s programme, has a similar view. \u201cEveryone in rugby knew this was going to be a big success but Tyrrells were still brave to put their hand up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good few years, and now we\u2019re looking at a very exciting, positive future.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I love about women\u2019s rugby is it\u2019s evolving at a rate of knots. Every week and every month is different. People are starting to understand the potential of women\u2019s sport. It\u2019s growing at such a rate compared to men\u2019s sport. A sponsor needs to realise what they\u2019re aligning with \u2013 so many stories, such diversity. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such an exciting thing.\u201d</p> <p>But for the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the competition\u2019s curtailment in mid-March, Sunday would have been Premier 15s finals day. Thoughts now turn fully to next season, which will start with the arrival of Exeter Chiefs and Sale Sharks and is due to end with the potential double boost of the Olympics, which for the second time will have rugby sevens in its schedule, and a World Cup in New Zealand that starts the following month.</p> <p>St John says: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a highly competitive year, with new teams coming in, and a huge season for women\u2019s rugby. We\u2019re going into year one of the next three-year cycle and it\u2019s going to be right at the forefront in terms of women\u2019s sport, a showpiece year for women\u2019s rugby that will give the sport a strong and visible platform. You\u2019ll hopefully get new fans from the Olympics, realising there\u2019s a top global competition to watch just a few weeks later.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/womens-six-nations-looks-to-move-in-rugby-calendar-increase-exposure\">Women's Six Nations looks to move in rugby calendar to increase exposure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rising quality of the league, and the unprecedented amount of exposure it would receive over the next couple of years if the international competitions are a success, has allowed many involved in the league to see Tyrrells\u2019 departure as an opportunity rather than a disappointment.</p> <p>Mather says: \u201cThe quality of games, the quality of the athletes, the whole infrastructure that sits behind women\u2019s top-level domestic league rugby, has improved exponentially.</p> <p>\u201cThe athletes who were playing before had this within them but they didn\u2019t have the back-up, the coaching, the analysts, the expertise. They\u2019ve got that now and the potential has flooded out of these athletes. The women\u2019s game is where there\u2019s the biggest growth, the product is there, and if we\u2019re organised and ready for when covid releases then women\u2019s sport \u2013 not just rugby \u2013 is going places.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "News on Tuesday that Tyrrells would not be renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier 15s for next season seemed on the face of it a blow for top-flight women\u2019s rugby, but with clubs having been assured that their funding from the Rugby Football Union remains ringfenced, and some in the sport not exactly mourning the crisp manufacturer\u2019s departure, mood at the top of the game remains buoyant. Last week the former England captain Catherine Spencer welcomed the fact that women\u2019s rugby is now free to find \u201ca more engaged sponsor\u201d that \u201cwants to be linked to sport\u201d. The suggestion is that the sport has grown considerably in the three years since Tyrrells signed up, and thus a different partner is now required. Giselle Mather, director of rugby at Wasps, says: \u201cIt would be a disappointment if we don\u2019t have a title sponsor for the league, but outside of that it doesn\u2019t change a massive amount for me. What I look at won\u2019t be different except for the logos on the post protectors and balls. I see it as a massive opportunity for a new sponsor, who is inheriting a product much better than the one we started with. \u201cIt\u2019s the close of a chapter to go to the next one. Tyrrells didn\u2019t do all the things they could have done to promote the game but they gave us a title sponsor, they gave us the start and enabled us to crack on and get the product right. Now we need a sponsor that does come to games, does get the grassroots coming in, get the women coming in so the game really builds.\u201d Atlanta St John, the head of Harlequins\u2019 women\u2019s programme, has a similar view. \u201cEveryone in rugby knew this was going to be a big success but Tyrrells were still brave to put their hand up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good few years, and now we\u2019re looking at a very exciting, positive future. \u201cWhat I love about women\u2019s rugby is it\u2019s evolving at a rate of knots. Every week and every month is different. People are starting to understand the potential of women\u2019s sport. It\u2019s growing at such a rate compared to men\u2019s sport. A sponsor needs to realise what they\u2019re aligning with \u2013 so many stories, such diversity. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such an exciting thing.\u201d But for the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the competition\u2019s curtailment in mid-March, Sunday would have been Premier 15s finals day. Thoughts now turn fully to next season, which will start with the arrival of Exeter Chiefs and Sale Sharks and is due to end with the potential double boost of the Olympics, which for the second time will have rugby sevens in its schedule, and a World Cup in New Zealand that starts the following month. St John says: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a highly competitive year, with new teams coming in, and a huge season for women\u2019s rugby. We\u2019re going into year one of the next three-year cycle and it\u2019s going to be right at the forefront in terms of women\u2019s sport, a showpiece year for women\u2019s rugby that will give the sport a strong and visible platform. You\u2019ll hopefully get new fans from the Olympics, realising there\u2019s a top global competition to watch just a few weeks later.\u201d The rising quality of the league, and the unprecedented amount of exposure it would receive over the next couple of years if the international competitions are a success, has allowed many involved in the league to see Tyrrells\u2019 departure as an opportunity rather than a disappointment. Mather says: \u201cThe quality of games, the quality of the athletes, the whole infrastructure that sits behind women\u2019s top-level domestic league rugby, has improved exponentially. \u201cThe athletes who were playing before had this within them but they didn\u2019t have the back-up, the coaching, the analysts, the expertise. They\u2019ve got that now and the potential has flooded out of these athletes. The women\u2019s game is where there\u2019s the biggest growth, the product is there, and if we\u2019re organised and ready for when covid releases then women\u2019s sport \u2013 not just rugby \u2013 is going places.\u201d",

The verses reflect the predicament of millions who are working from home while coping with childcare, video conferencing and the pandemic.</p> <p>Jon Whitfield QC of Doughty Street Chambers in London, who co-edited the collection Lockdown Lawyers said the 50-plus poems \u2013 including haikus, parodies and extended ballads \u2013 cover \u201cfalling revenue, falling ceilings, the fear of infection in dirty courts, police stations and prisons with no PPE, the despair of clients in custody or facing huge challenges with cases postponed indefinitely\u201d.</p> <p>Whitfield, who also sits as a judge in the court of protection and is a trustee of the Winchester poetry festival, said he asked himself: \u201cHow has the publicly funded legal system survived this pandemic at all, given it has endured 35 years of cuts whilst saddled with huge increases in expense and workload?</p> <p>\u201cHowever, as I pondered and read the contributions, I realised the answer is simple. It is the lawyers that work themselves to a standstill to keep a broken system going \u2026 Despite the endless worry of practice, multiplied by the pandemic they still find time to support each other, smile, be creative.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Trevett, a paralegal at the law firm Irwin Mitchell based in Bristol, came up with the idea after organising virtual events during the Covid-19 crisis that frequently ended with a poem being read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI sent out a message on Twitter calling for anonymous poetry from legal aid lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cI was astounded by the response. Poems flooded in from around the country. I was surprised to find other lawyers that regularly wrote poetry and, that those who did not were excited to have a go.\u201d</p> <p>Contributors include judges, QCs, the Secret Barrister blogger, other barristers and solicitors and law centre staff. None of the poems are individually signed, allowing writers the freedom to express themselves anonymously. It is published by the <a href=\"https://www.lag.org.uk/\">Legal Action Group (LAG)</a>.

That acute sensitivity about exposing domestic lives through remote working is one of the recurring themes in an anthology of legal lyrics published this week. The frustrations of our confined lives have inspired a chorus of confessions, drawing on the sense that although lockdown is only 10 weeks old it feels like an eternity. Some courts have adapted rapidly to remote working or have simply closed, but others still require lawyers, defendants, court staff and witnesses to appear for urgent cases. The book is written by and dedicated to legal aid practitioners who have kept the justice system going. The verses reflect the predicament of millions who are working from home while coping with childcare, video conferencing and the pandemic. Jon Whitfield QC of Doughty Street Chambers in London, who co-edited the collection Lockdown Lawyers said the 50-plus poems \u2013 including haikus, parodies and extended ballads \u2013 cover \u201cfalling revenue, falling ceilings, the fear of infection in dirty courts, police stations and prisons with no PPE, the despair of clients in custody or facing huge challenges with cases postponed indefinitely\u201d. Whitfield, who also sits as a judge in the court of protection and is a trustee of the Winchester poetry festival, said he asked himself: \u201cHow has the publicly funded legal system survived this pandemic at all, given it has endured 35 years of cuts whilst saddled with huge increases in expense and workload? \u201cHowever, as I pondered and read the contributions, I realised the answer is simple. It is the lawyers that work themselves to a standstill to keep a broken system going \u2026 Despite the endless worry of practice, multiplied by the pandemic they still find time to support each other, smile, be creative.\u201d Emma Trevett, a paralegal at the law firm Irwin Mitchell based in Bristol, came up with the idea after organising virtual events during the Covid-19 crisis that frequently ended with a poem being read. \u201cI sent out a message on Twitter calling for anonymous poetry from legal aid lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cI was astounded by the response. Poems flooded in from around the country. I was surprised to find other lawyers that regularly wrote poetry and, that those who did not were excited to have a go.\u201d Contributors include judges, QCs, the Secret Barrister blogger, other barristers and solicitors and law centre staff. None of the poems are individually signed, allowing writers the freedom to express themselves anonymously. It is published by the Legal Action Group (LAG). Funds raised will be donated to the Law Centres Network. COVID Limerick No 5 It\u2019s all very well to do Zoom, but it\u2019s better to be in the room. One misses the \u2018tells\u2019, the ticks and the smells, there\u2019s a danger injustice will loom!",

      "body": "<p>Desperate to get the country moving again, the government is promising a new era for cyclists, with pop-up bike lanes, car-free corridors and major investment to make roads safer across the UK. It just goes to show that sometimes you have to be forced to see the light. My own cycling conversion happened back in 2003, when the London congestion charge made it no longer possible to drive for free through the capital. I swore I would never pay it \u2013 and I never have.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given the far bigger incentive of the Covid-19 crisis, this seems a rather shaming admission, except that it makes me an outlier. Most converts quickly fall by the wayside, but \u2013 apart from the occasional snowstorm, the odd multi-journey morning \u2013 I have never wavered, and that is because I\u2019m not a zealot but a cycling pragmatist. I don\u2019t cover huge distances \u2013 around 40-50 miles in a normal working week \u2013 but they are miles free from traffic jams and overstuffed tubes, and give me regular exercise while delivering me to my destination at a speed considerably faster than the seven-minute urban car mile. So if coronavirus is encouraging you to rethink how you get around, here are my top tips for a long and happy life on two wheels.&nbsp;</p> <h2>1 A bike is for life, not just for Christmas</h2> <p>It\u2019s no good getting a posh road racer if your home is surrounded by potholes, which applies to most of us who live in post-austerity Britain. Meanwhile, those picturesque Dutch sit-up-and-begs are hard work if you live on a hill (you may not even know you do until you start riding up it), while mountain bikes are best saved for mountains. For everyday commuting, a reasonably priced hybrid is probably your best bet, while the extra poke of an e-bike will do wonders for morale after a hard day at the office. But don\u2019t take my word for it: consult a bike shop.&nbsp;</p> <p>My local indie, Push Cycles, reports a nationwide shortage of small bikes, while the Manchester co-op, Bicycle Doctor, has stopped taking on repairs so it can concentrate on new orders. But national chains Halfords and Evans Cycles have now reopened. Evans\u2019 Castleford branch in Leeds reported taking its mechanics off furlough last week and says that the supply line for big brands \u2013 Trek, for instance, which is manufactured in mainland Europe \u2013 is sorting itself out.</p> <h2>&nbsp;<strong>2 </strong><strong>Don\u2019t let the scare stories grind you down</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da1960892d3484a08ff6e7cf7f406c49ac79e87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da1960892d3484a08ff6e7cf7f406c49ac79e87/0_256_4287_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists negotiating London traffic at night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There are just 1,011 casualties for every billion cycle miles \u2013 a little more than one per million.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: D Hale-Sutton/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents points out that, according to its latest figures, there are just <a href=\"https://www.rospa.com/media/documents/road-safety/cycling-accidents-factsheet.pdf\">1,011 casualties</a> for every billion cycle miles \u2013&nbsp;a little more than one per million.And while the bike website <a href=\"https://road.cc/\">road.cc</a> says there were more than twice the number of cycling deaths in the first month of the lockdown than the average for this time of year \u2013 15 across the four nations \u2013 this begs an obvious comparison with Covid-19 casualty rates. It could also be a statistical blip.</p> <h2><strong>3 </strong><strong>The simplest precautions are often the best</strong></h2> <p>With more than 100,000 bicycles reported stolen in England and Wales last year, your biggest problem is likely to be keeping yours safe. Lincolnshire police advise spending 10%-15% of the cost of your bike on a lock. Make sure it has a Sold Secure rating, which comes in gold, silver and bronze according to the value of your bike (your insurance will not pay out without one). You can add it to the national <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a> database free of charge and deter petty thieves by buying a kit to print the number on the frame. If you are buying a bike secondhand, make sure it is not hot property by running the number through the register\u2019s BikeChecker.</p> <h2><strong>4 </strong><strong>Make visibility your mantra</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2ff42cc9c74fc7667827467eea5905c3ea0c6f9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff42cc9c74fc7667827467eea5905c3ea0c6f9e/113_323_2557_1534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bikers safety lights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Safety lights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SasPartout/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last thing you want to have to do at the end of a night out is abandon your bike because your front light has run out of battery or your back one has been stolen. It is illegal in the UK to cycle on a public road after dark without lights and reflectors and they must be on the bike and not your helmet. One solution is to invest in battery-free lights, which are attached to the frame of the bike and generate energy through the rotation of the wheel (my go-to is the Danish firm Reelight), combined with a couple of those little rubbery slip-ons, with names such as Knog Frog, which show that even if all else fails, at least you exist. On country lanes especially, visibility is your first and best defence \u2013 and make that your mantra for clothing, too.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>5 </strong><strong>Avoid the all-or-nothing fallacy</strong></h2> <p>The weather forecast is the enemy of cycling morale. But even if rain is due, the odds are that if it is dry when you start out, you will not get wet. And with a little flexibility in your working hours, you will be able to have a dry run home, too. But it is better to cycle a couple of times a week than not to cycle at all. I do not cycle in the West End of London, because I have had too many near misses with cab doors and happy-hour revellers, so if I am going out in the evening \u2013 obviously a fond memory at this moment in time \u2013 I will often ride to a nearby station and hop on the tube. So as not to arrive looking like Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz, I have a passably elegant handbag that doubles as a backpack. Try to carry a waterproof bag to put over the saddle, because there are few things more demoralising than riding home at midnight with a soggy bum.&nbsp;</p> <h2>&nbsp;<strong>6</strong><strong> A pannier is not just for carrying things</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ef226d9caea3c48438afe0e870230d75bc1517a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef226d9caea3c48438afe0e870230d75bc1517a/0_123_5680_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bicycle with brown leather panniers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A sturdy pair of rear-mounted panniers will keep your centre of gravity low.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natasha-Aleksandra/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Handlebar baskets look good but are hopeless when it rains, while dangling shopping bags from them is a shortcut to A&amp;E and nobody wants to end up there. A sturdy pair of rear-mounted panniers, preferably with reflectors or in a bright colour, will keep your centre of gravity low, which is good for balance, while encouraging motorists to give you a wider berth. No one is going to pick a fight with a pair of yellow Ortliebs.</p> <h2>&nbsp;<strong>7</strong><strong> Never forget your pump</strong></h2> <p>Think about what you need to carry around with you and equip yourself accordingly. Always carry waterproofs, a spare inner tube and one of those dinky little pumps. Now\u2019s the time to teach yourself to fix a puncture, but even if you can\u2019t, the roads are paved with cycle samaritans who will be willing to help if you can provide the tube. You can even be one yourself from time to time.</p> <h2><strong>8</strong><strong> Keep a change of clothes to hand</strong></h2> <p>You are going to need decent waterproofs when it is bucketing down, but they can make you feel like a boil-in-the-bag on warm drizzle days. Not everyone wants to go full Lycra, or is lucky enough to have the use of a shower on arrival. Mudguards will stop the worst of the splatter, but the water that splashes up, or sideways, is usually more of a problem than that which comes down. Do not assume that an old pair of jeans is the solution: there is a reason why Scottish highlanders wear kilts. Keep spares at work. And remember: it is not shameful to look wind-blown or helmet-haired for the minutes that it takes to get to a changing-room mirror. It is the inner glow that counts.</p> <h2><strong>9</strong><strong>&nbsp;Dominate the road</strong></h2> <p>This was a piece of roadside wisdom from a cycling samaritan who stopped to fix a puncture for me: do not feel you make yourself safer by making yourself small. Counterintuitive though it may seem, timid cyclists have more accidents. Command the road, particularly on bends \u2013 not only because the edges contain all sorts of hidden hazards like sunken drain covers and untended potholes, but also because a motorist will instinctively <a href=\"https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/community/how-to/road-positioning\">match the distance</a> between car and bike with that between bike and kerb. You may get some abuse, but words won\u2019t cut you up.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>10 \u2026 and have a happy holiday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217fa74670f33ed0aff998b0a4fc946aacceda80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/217fa74670f33ed0aff998b0a4fc946aacceda80/0_307_5150_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Touring isn\u2019t my bag, because I like to take stacks of books on holiday and can\u2019t bear the faff of camping or the uncertainties of summer storms. So I have devised a daisy system where you drive to a single base and cycle around a different \u201cpetal\u201d each day \u2013 that way you do not find yourself reading papier-mache and you earn your lunch. On our last fortnight\u2019s holiday, we looped our way round 300 miles of rural France, none of it more than 20 miles from home.&nbsp;Have faith that bike-friendly trains will eventually be restored to the European holiday spot of your choice \u2013 Germany in particular is cycle heaven \u2013 but so long as that remains out of bounds, try devising a daisy trail closer to home.</p> <p>The UK has 1,504 miles of dedicated traffic-free cycle routes, but even if none are in your neck of the woods, the lobbying charity Sustrans has a nifty little tool on its website that enables you to plan your own journey \u2013 by location, distance and road type \u2013 on the National Cycle Network. It also has a map of pop-up road closures imposed by local authorities to give cyclists and pedestrians a clear run through the Covid-19 crisis. Who knows, if enough of us make use of them, they might even be here to stay.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2020 because an earlier version, due to a editing error, referred to central London when the West End of London was the intended reference.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Desperate to get the country moving again, the government is promising a new era for cyclists, with pop-up bike lanes, car-free corridors and major investment to make roads safer across the UK. It just goes to show that sometimes you have to be forced to see the light. My own cycling conversion happened back in 2003, when the London congestion charge made it no longer possible to drive for free through the capital. I swore I would never pay it \u2013 and I never have. Given the far bigger incentive of the Covid-19 crisis, this seems a rather shaming admission, except that it makes me an outlier. Most converts quickly fall by the wayside, but \u2013 apart from the occasional snowstorm, the odd multi-journey morning \u2013 I have never wavered, and that is because I\u2019m not a zealot but a cycling pragmatist. I don\u2019t cover huge distances \u2013 around 40-50 miles in a normal working week \u2013 but they are miles free from traffic jams and overstuffed tubes, and give me regular exercise while delivering me to my destination at a speed considerably faster than the seven-minute urban car mile. So if coronavirus is encouraging you to rethink how you get around, here are my top tips for a long and happy life on two wheels. 1 A bike is for life, not just for Christmas It\u2019s no good getting a posh road racer if your home is surrounded by potholes, which applies to most of us who live in post-austerity Britain. Meanwhile, those picturesque Dutch sit-up-and-begs are hard work if you live on a hill (you may not even know you do until you start riding up it), while mountain bikes are best saved for mountains. For everyday commuting, a reasonably priced hybrid is probably your best bet, while the extra poke of an e-bike will do wonders for morale after a hard day at the office. But don\u2019t take my word for it: consult a bike shop. My local indie, Push Cycles, reports a nationwide shortage of small bikes, while the Manchester co-op, Bicycle Doctor, has stopped taking on repairs so it can concentrate on new orders. But national chains Halfords and Evans Cycles have now reopened. Evans\u2019 Castleford branch in Leeds reported taking its mechanics off furlough last week and says that the supply line for big brands \u2013 Trek, for instance, which is manufactured in mainland Europe \u2013 is sorting itself out. 2 Don\u2019t let the scare stories grind you down The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents points out that, according to its latest figures, there are just 1,011 casualties for every billion cycle miles \u2013 a little more than one per million.And while the bike website road.cc says there were more than twice the number of cycling deaths in the first month of the lockdown than the average for this time of year \u2013 15 across the four nations \u2013 this begs an obvious comparison with Covid-19 casualty rates. It could also be a statistical blip. 3 The simplest precautions are often the best With more than 100,000 bicycles reported stolen in England and Wales last year, your biggest problem is likely to be keeping yours safe. Lincolnshire police advise spending 10%-15% of the cost of your bike on a lock. Make sure it has a Sold Secure rating, which comes in gold, silver and bronze according to the value of your bike (your insurance will not pay out without one). You can add it to the national BikeRegister database free of charge and deter petty thieves by buying a kit to print the number on the frame. If you are buying a bike secondhand, make sure it is not hot property by running the number through the register\u2019s BikeChecker. 4 Make visibility your mantra The last thing you want to have to do at the end of a night out is abandon your bike because your front light has run out of battery or your back one has been stolen. It is illegal in the UK to cycle on a public road after dark without lights and reflectors and they must be on the bike and not your helmet. One solution is to invest in battery-free lights, which are attached to the frame of the bike and generate energy through the rotation of the wheel (my go-to is the Danish firm Reelight), combined with a couple of those little rubbery slip-ons, with names such as Knog Frog, which show that even if all else fails, at least you exist. On country lanes especially, visibility is your first and best defence \u2013 and make that your mantra for clothing, too. 5 Avoid the all-or-nothing fallacy The weather forecast is the enemy of cycling morale. But even if rain is due, the odds are that if it is dry when you start out, you will not get wet. And with a little flexibility in your working hours, you will be able to have a dry run home, too. But it is better to cycle a couple of times a week than not to cycle at all. I do not cycle in the West End of London, because I have had too many near misses with cab doors and happy-hour revellers, so if I am going out in the evening \u2013 obviously a fond memory at this moment in time \u2013 I will often ride to a nearby station and hop on the tube. So as not to arrive looking like Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz, I have a passably elegant handbag that doubles as a backpack. Try to carry a waterproof bag to put over the saddle, because there are few things more demoralising than riding home at midnight with a soggy bum. 6 A pannier is not just for carrying things Handlebar baskets look good but are hopeless when it rains, while dangling shopping bags from them is a shortcut to A&amp;E and nobody wants to end up there. A sturdy pair of rear-mounted panniers, preferably with reflectors or in a bright colour, will keep your centre of gravity low, which is good for balance, while encouraging motorists to give you a wider berth. No one is going to pick a fight with a pair of yellow Ortliebs. 7 Never forget your pump Think about what you need to carry around with you and equip yourself accordingly. Always carry waterproofs, a spare inner tube and one of those dinky little pumps. Now\u2019s the time to teach yourself to fix a puncture, but even if you can\u2019t, the roads are paved with cycle samaritans who will be willing to help if you can provide the tube. You can even be one yourself from time to time. 8 Keep a change of clothes to hand You are going to need decent waterproofs when it is bucketing down, but they can make you feel like a boil-in-the-bag on warm drizzle days. Not everyone wants to go full Lycra, or is lucky enough to have the use of a shower on arrival. Mudguards will stop the worst of the splatter, but the water that splashes up, or sideways, is usually more of a problem than that which comes down. Do not assume that an old pair of jeans is the solution: there is a reason why Scottish highlanders wear kilts. Keep spares at work. And remember: it is not shameful to look wind-blown or helmet-haired for the minutes that it takes to get to a changing-room mirror. It is the inner glow that counts. 9 Dominate the road This was a piece of roadside wisdom from a cycling samaritan who stopped to fix a puncture for me: do not feel you make yourself safer by making yourself small. Counterintuitive though it may seem, timid cyclists have more accidents. Command the road, particularly on bends \u2013 not only because the edges contain all sorts of hidden hazards like sunken drain covers and untended potholes, but also because a motorist will instinctively match the distance between car and bike with that between bike and kerb. You may get some abuse, but words won\u2019t cut you up. 10 \u2026 and have a happy holiday Touring isn\u2019t my bag, because I like to take stacks of books on holiday and can\u2019t bear the faff of camping or the uncertainties of summer storms. So I have devised a daisy system where you drive to a single base and cycle around a different \u201cpetal\u201d each day \u2013 that way you do not find yourself reading papier-mache and you earn your lunch. On our last fortnight\u2019s holiday, we looped our way round 300 miles of rural France, none of it more than 20 miles from home. Have faith that bike-friendly trains will eventually be restored to the European holiday spot of your choice \u2013 Germany in particular is cycle heaven \u2013 but so long as that remains out of bounds, try devising a daisy trail closer to home. The UK has 1,504 miles of dedicated traffic-free cycle routes, but even if none are in your neck of the woods, the lobbying charity Sustrans has a nifty little tool on its website that enables you to plan your own journey \u2013 by location, distance and road type \u2013 on the National Cycle Network. It also has a map of pop-up road closures imposed by local authorities to give cyclists and pedestrians a clear run through the Covid-19 crisis. Who knows, if enough of us make use of them, they might even be here to stay. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2020 because an earlier version, due to a editing error, referred to central London when the West End of London was the intended reference.",

The Leaning Tower of Pisa, which usually attracts 5 million visitors a year, is only permitting 15 people in at a time. They have to wear face masks and an electronic device that warns them if they are less than a metre of anyone else.</p> \n<p>Pierfrancesco Pacini, the president of the board of directors responsible for the tower and surrounding monuments, told the Italian news agency Ansa: \u201cOur budget will suffer heavy losses but we wanted to send a signal of confidence and hope.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\" data-alt=\"Johns Hopkins graph Italy\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\">Johns Hopkins graph Italy</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Visitors to the Colosseum will have to purchase their tickets online, wear face masks and have their temperature taken before entering.

The 104 people who visited on the first day were mostly local residents. Massimo Osanna, the park\u2019s director, said he hoped the site could attract 1.5 million visitors this year, 2.5 million fewer than would usually visit.</p> \n<p>For now, the sites can only be enjoyed by local residents. Restrictions on inter-regional travel are due to be lifted on 3 June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Italy is also preparing to open its borders to EU tourists, and those from the UK, from 3 June, Italians could be barred from visiting some fellow EU states because of the severity of Italy\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak.

      "bodyText": "Some of Italy\u2019s most famous cultural sites are coming back to life after being closed for more than three months as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Leaning Tower of Pisa reopened on Saturday, the Colosseum and Vatican Museums will welcome visitors again from Monday and Florence\u2019s Uffizi gallery from Tuesday. A huge exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of the Renaissance painter Raphael will open at Le Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome on Monday. All sites and museums are reopening with strict safety measures in place. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, which usually attracts 5 million visitors a year, is only permitting 15 people in at a time. They have to wear face masks and an electronic device that warns them if they are less than a metre of anyone else. Pierfrancesco Pacini, the president of the board of directors responsible for the tower and surrounding monuments, told the Italian news agency Ansa: \u201cOur budget will suffer heavy losses but we wanted to send a signal of confidence and hope.\u201d Visitors to the Colosseum will have to purchase their tickets online, wear face masks and have their temperature taken before entering. Group numbers have been capped at 14. The Pompeii archaeological park reopened last Tuesday with similar measures in place. The 104 people who visited on the first day were mostly local residents. Massimo Osanna, the park\u2019s director, said he hoped the site could attract 1.5 million visitors this year, 2.5 million fewer than would usually visit. For now, the sites can only be enjoyed by local residents. Restrictions on inter-regional travel are due to be lifted on 3 June. While Italy is also preparing to open its borders to EU tourists, and those from the UK, from 3 June, Italians could be barred from visiting some fellow EU states because of the severity of Italy\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak. Luigi Di Maio, the foreign minister, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe do not accept blacklists \u2026 if anyone thinks they can treat us like a leper colony, then they should know that we will not stand for it.\u201d",

With at least 369,000 deaths confirmed worldwide since the pandemic began in China in January \u2013 and that number believed to be an underestimate \u2013 Brazil\u2019s virus death toll of 28,834 has now surpassed that of France with the country reporting 33,274 new infections in the past 24 hours. The 6 million infections total was passed as Pope Francis pointedly insisted that people were more important than economies as countries decide how quickly to reopen from coronavirus lockdowns. The pope made his unscripted comments, without naming any specific countries, in his noon address from his window overlooking St Peter\u2019s Square, as Italy\u2019s lockdown drew to an end. \u201cHealing people, not saving [money] to help the economy [is important], healing people, who are more important than the economy,\u201d Francis said as he also appealed to people to reject pessimism.

The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, also condemned the move and pledged intensive talks with Washington on the issue. In the US, the country with the world\u2019s highest coronavirus death toll, local state and city officials warned that the public gatherings in the countrywide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis risked triggering even more infections, with some testing centres being closed because of the protests. Among them, the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, warned that hospitals were \u201con the verge of being overrun\u201d, adding that \u201cdemonstrators should wear masks and try to practice social distancing\u201d, while the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, said all coronavirus testing centres across the city had closed on Saturday because of safety concerns. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, also suggested those attending demonstrations should seek a test for Covid-19. The pandemic has provoked differing approaches from politicians and public health authorities around the world, not only over the response during the period of peak infections but also over how to ease their lockdowns. Spain\u2019s prime minister said on Sunday he would ask parliament to agree to a final two-week extension of the state-of-emergency lockdown until 21 June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements. Pedro S\u00e1nchez told regional government leaders during a video conference meeting that this would be the last lockdown as Spain\u2019s infection rates have reduced dramatically. The country\u2019s death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, reflecting a dramatic decline in daily fatalities as Spain brings the outbreak under control. The number of Covid-19 infections increased by 271 overnight to 239,228 on Saturday. In France, the country\u2019s health agency, Sant\u00e9 Publique France, said there was no sign of a rise in Covid-19 cases in the country since the strict nationwide lockdown was lifted three weeks ago. The authority reported that the circulation of Covid-19 had been dropping for more than seven weeks, meaning fewer emergency patients at hospitals and a decrease in the number of patients being admitted to intensive care. The Middle East has also seen efforts to ease restrictions, with tens of thousands of mosques across Saudi Arabia reopening on Sunday for the first time in more than two months, although with worshippers ordered to follow strict guidelines. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam\u2019s holiest site outside of Saudi Arabia, also reopened for prayers for the first time since it was closed in mid-March. With little regard for physical distancing, throngs waited outside the holy site\u2019s gates before it opened early on Sunday, with many wearing surgical masks. As they were allowed to enter, the faithful stopped to have their temperature measured. Agencies contributed to this report",

Jenrick says people of faith may find it strange that place of worship aren\u2019t open while shops are. Says they have a task force with faith leaders, who are providing guidance, including about cleaning churches, training volunteers.

Adds that it will be a staggered effort, with fewer children in each classroom, and government is working with teachers and trade unions. It\u2019s important to get children back in school, as poorer children are losing out the most.</p> \n  <p>Harries says testing capacity is very significant, and contact traces are underway.

Ask why should people feel safer now than at beginning of outbreak, given the high number of cases. Harries says we understand risk better now, and shielding was a way to reduce exposure to the virus during its peak. She says at the start it was 1/40 to meeting someone with the disease, now it is about 1/400. </p> \n  <p>Jenrick says government now feels the rate of infection is sufficiently low to do small things that will make a \u201chuge difference\u201d to the people who are shielding.

She says that some people who are at the ends of their lives may feel differently to others. Harries says we now have much more data on individual diseases, and they are trying to estimate risk better.

Stresses that the public needs to stick to the messages - not just about what it is possible to do, but what it is \u201csensible to do\u201d.

months from Monday, PA media reports.</p> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> praised their resilience as he said those shielding from Covid-19 in England will be able to spend time with other people outdoors.</p> \n  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> said the full guidance will be revealed on Sunday, as charities called for the scientific evidence behind the decision to be made clear and urged more help.<br></p> \n  <p>Those considered extremely vulnerable will be able to go outside with members of their household from Monday, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.<br></p> \n  <p>And those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.</p> \n  <p>Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks.</p> \n  <p>Johnson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been looking at how we can make life easier for our most vulnerable, so today I am happy to confirm that those who are shielding will be able to spend time outside with someone else, observing social distance guidelines.</p> \n   <p>I will do what I can, in line with the scientific advice, to continue making life easier for you over the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Jenrick said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Incidence rates of coronavirus are now significantly lower than before these measures were put in place.<br></p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we are focused on finding the right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the difficult situation more bearable - particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek.</p> \n   <p>We will now be providing regular updates to the shielded to guide them through the next phase and, we hope, to better and less restrictive times. In the meantime we will continue to provide the support that the shielded in our communities need.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"761d0ccbff530f887c0b55fd230f66d3a0ebf625\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/761d0ccbff530f887c0b55fd230f66d3a0ebf625/0_193_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this photo issued by 10 Downing Street, Britain\u2019s Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick speaks during a coronavirus media briefing in Downing Street, London, Wednesday May 13, 2020.

People who are shielding will be able to go outside, from Monday, along with household members or one person outwith their household. Dr Jenny Harries and Robert Jenrick repeatedly stressed that the changes to shielding guidance are advisory. The importance of maintaining social distancing by all was also underlined. Here are some of the figures Dr Harries presented, explaining the gradual downturn in deaths means we must remain careful and follow social distancing measures. 113 Covid-19 deaths have been confirmed over the last 24 hours. A total of 38,489 people have died. There were 1,936 cases confirmed as of 31 May, and 274,762 cases in total. Across the UK, 9% of ventilator beds are occupied, and trending downwards in every country. 545 patients were estimated to have been admitted on 29 May in England. There were 115,725 tests on 31 May, and 4,285,738 tests in total. Dame Louise Casey described the rough sleeping outreach efforts as a \u201csmall but incredible silver lining in dark cloud of Covid-19\u201d. A total of 15,000 rough sleepers are now being helped; Jenrick said 90% of rough sleepers had been offered accommodation. 6,000 new supported homes are to be made available to rough sleepers, with \u00a3160m to be spent on them this year. Rev Stephen Brooks, Keep the Faith magazine, asks about religious assembling: while it is intrinsic to people\u2019s faith, we have seen outbreaks such as one in a church in Frankfurt. Jenrick says people of faith may find it strange that place of worship aren\u2019t open while shops are. Says they have a task force with faith leaders, who are providing guidance, including about cleaning churches, training volunteers. Says first step would be to open them for private prayer, as a springboard for small weddings and then services. Crerar asks about Cummings - what will the government do if the public now doesn\u2019t follow guidelines as closely? Jenrick says it\u2019s incumbent on public as well as scientists to track it. If the R number rises above 1, we won\u2019t be able to continue easing the lockdown. Pippa Crerar, Mirror, asks how they can reassure parents and teachers that it is safe to have children return to school? Jenrick says 80% of schools have been open for children of key workers and vulnerable children. Says he believes it is safe, and that we can look to Europe to see this. Adds that it will be a staggered effort, with fewer children in each classroom, and government is working with teachers and trade unions. It\u2019s important to get children back in school, as poorer children are losing out the most. Harries says testing capacity is very significant, and contact traces are underway. Says testing for under-5s also in place. The advice for children is that they stick in small groups to reduce transmission. John Stevens, Daily Mail, asks about people with relatives in care homes - can they visit? Harries says care homes vary hugely, residential care exists for younger as well as older people. Says people with dementia may find it difficult to follow measures. She stresses importance of keeping infection very low in care homes, and says the advice will probably be very precautionary until transmission is very reduced. She says it\u2019s probably to early to make changes in care homes. Asks about \u00a31bn housing development agreed after event with the developer. Jenrick says it was judged on \u201cmerit\u201d and there was no bias in the decision. Says they offered to redetermine decision with other parties. When will playgrounds and parks open? Jenrick says parks are open, and playgrounds are more difficult as children won\u2019t social distance. Harries says it won\u2019t happen in the immediate future. Do the rules apply to all? Harries says \u201cabsolutely\u201d and on a matter of personal and professional integrity, she will always follow them. She says if we start to spot things in data, there is opportunity to change how we go forward. Jane Deith, Channel 4, asks about easing of lockdown using Covid alert system. If alert level hasn\u2019t changed, what has? Jenrick says we are still at 4, but moving to 3. Says steps that are being taken are modest and cautious and \u201centirely consistent\u201d with the PM\u2019s message about alerts. Should we be concerned that the number of deaths has plateaued? Harries says we have to keep applying measures, and limit number of interactions. We know that data relies on when cases are reported, and that a period of a few days is unreliable - rolling averages give a clearer picture. Paul Brand, ITV, asks about those who are shielding and still feel vulnerable. Ask why should people feel safer now than at beginning of outbreak, given the high number of cases. Harries says we understand risk better now, and shielding was a way to reduce exposure to the virus during its peak. She says at the start it was 1/40 to meeting someone with the disease, now it is about 1/400. Jenrick says government now feels the rate of infection is sufficiently low to do small things that will make a \u201chuge difference\u201d to the people who are shielding. Stresses that it is an individual choice. Mason asks about people who may have been asked to shield unnecessarily. Jenrick says shielded category is over 2 million people with varied conditions, and says they want to move towards a more specific approach. Says advice remains that shielded should stay home, with small changes to be made from tomorrow about going outside. Harries once again stresses that it is advice, saying that there has been a wide range of responses to this. She says that some people who are at the ends of their lives may feel differently to others. Harries says we now have much more data on individual diseases, and they are trying to estimate risk better. For the time being it will be left as it is. Chris Mason, BBC, asks if government is worried about pictures seen this weekend where social distancing hasn\u2019t been observed. Jenrick says they are confident that steps they\u2019re taking from Monday are manageable, but margin is limited. Harries says if you\u2019re outdoors, risk of transmission is very low.However, it is worrying that people may be \u201ccramming into cars\u201d, sharing cutlery on the beach and being very close together. Stresses that the public needs to stick to the messages - not just about what it is possible to do, but what it is \u201csensible to do\u201d. She also stresses the need to balance for mental health, and says interactions should be limited. Another question from the public is about how the government will support rural communities to transcend the crisis. Jenrick says the government has brought forward an unprecedented range of measures, including job retention scheme, bounce back loans for businesses. Says they are working closely with agriculture industry, thanks the food and drinks industry and supermarkets. Raises the challenge of getting workers in agriculture this summer, and says there are schemes in place encouraging this. A question about how to know if a track and trace call is genuine, one person asks. Harries says there is a lot of confidentiality and it will be unlikely you will be contacted by someone with other motives. She says it will be clear that they are genuine - they are professionally trained individuals. 113 Covid deaths have been confirmed over the last 24 hours. The numbers are coming down, she says, but quite slowly. 38,489 people have died. Across the UK, people in hospital with coronavirus down by 15%. Says there have been changes in the way data is reported in Wales and Northern Ireland. All cases are falling, but warns the downward slope is \u201cgentle\u201d. 9% of ventilator beds are occupied across UK, and trending downwards in every country. Just 545 patients estimated to have been admitted on 29 May in England. Harries says confirmed case total won\u2019t reflect the totality, but case numbers are coming down despite increased testing. The figures: 115,725 test as of 31 May. 4,285,738 test in total. 1,936 cases confirmed as of 31 May, and 274,762 cases in total. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries has the figures. Transport data compared with earlier in the year or last year. She says car use is picking up, and reminds people to only travel in car with household members. Commercial vehicle is also rising. National rail, transport and bus services have remained very low use - used by key workers only. Says it is important to be careful with transport, encourages walking and cycling. Casey says rough sleeping outreach has been a \u201csmall but incredible silver lining in dark cloud of Covid-19\u201d. Casey says she stands ready to work with all partners across UK. \u201cWe can help the most vulnerable sleepers in the long term\u201d. None of us should underestimate challenge ahead, she says, thanking the NHS, local government and charity groups. She also names the Anglican and Catholic churches as well as Comic Relief. Dame Louise Casey says \u201cpandemic is not over\u201d. Says the task was to bring as many off the streets, give them the chance to self isolate. Calls it an \u201cextraordinary response\u201d and says 15,000 people have now been helped. She thanks everyone involved, including council staff and hotels, as well as community groups. Describes it as a \u201cheartening example and best of Britain\u201d Jenrick says rough sleeping is a health issue, and says support will be offered. Homes to be a \u201cspringboard\u201d and new national asset. \u201cNo ones path is predetermined\u201d. As we enter the next phase, it\u2019s time to look ahead. \u201cWords and promises are not enough\u201d - we now know who rough sleepers are, and can tailor the support. Some will need help to enter private accommodation. 6,000 new supported home to be made available to rough sleepers. \u00a3160m to be spent this year. Now for an update on rough sleeping. Jenrick says government felt they had special duty to rough sleepers, and 90% of rough sleepers were offered accommodation. He says councils in England were provided with funding to provide accommodation. Follow the review, the NHS will write to all individuals on shielding list, with advice and support available, Jenrick says, depending on the prevalence of Covid-19 in the environment. He thanks all those shielding for \u201cpatience and fortitude\u201d. Each assessment will be based on \u201cbest data\u201d available on covid-19. The next review will take place in week of 15 June. \u201cYou should only do what you are comfortable with,\u201d Jenrick says. He adds guidance may be extended after end of June if needed. Reviews are based on latest data. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve passed the peak, the risk to those shielding is lower,\u201d Jenrick says. Stresses advice is advisory. Shielding guidance updated: from tomorrow, they can take initial steps to spend time outdoors. This is for England only, but working closely with devolved govts. They can spend time with their households, or one person from outside the household. The full guidance will be updated to gov.uk. \u201cYou must still follow social distancing guidelines\u201d but will enable shielding people to see family members beyond their household. Jenrick says he\u2019s \u201cimmensely grateful\u201d to those in NHS, local and parish councils for supporting residents. Over 350,000 have registered for government support. More than half have also said they want someone to talk to over phone, Jenrick says. \u201cnone of us should forget the mental burden\u201d of social distancing, and urges people to reach out for support if they need it. Jenrick says many of these people haven\u2019t left home for over 10 weeks. 2.5 million free food boxes have been delivered, including medicine. This has been done by working closely with NHS. Many of the people sheilding are working at home, Jenrick says. \u201cThey\u2019ve all made a huge sacrifice.\u201d He expresses admiration for their efforts, and acknowledges impact on their family members. At the start of the pandemic, vulnerable people were asked to shield until 30 June, Jenrick says. He explains who is shielding - not just older people, over half over 70 , over 90,000 are children, who will not be able to return to school. Jenrick is joined by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries and Dame Louise Casey DBE C advisor on rough sleeping. Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019ll be covering the daily coronavirus briefing, set to begin in a few minutes and led by Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus testing capacity reached 200,000 on Saturday, PA Media reports. This includes capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, and is on track to meet the milestone health secretary Matt Hancock set for the end of May. The number of people to die after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK has risen by 113 to 38,489, the Department of Health has said. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 115,725 tests were carried out or dispatched with 1,936 positive results. Overall, a total of 4,285,738 tests have been carried out and 274,762 cases have been confirmed positive. The clock is ticking down to the daily Downing Street briefing on the coronavirus crisis. It is set to take place at 4pm today and will be led by communities secretary Robert Jenrick. People in Wales who have been shielding due to coronavirus will be able to exercise outdoors from Monday, PA Media reports. They are also able to meet people from another household but must not go into another house or share food. The Welsh Government has not made any other changes to the advice for those who are shielding. Those in the group should not go shopping or attend work outside their home, and must continue to have food and medicine delivered to them. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, said: Risk can never be completely eliminated but we advise those shielding to exercise at times that are less busy, so the risk of contact with others is reduced. We have advised everyone in Wales to maintain social distance of two meters and keep good hygiene when meeting outdoors. For those who are shielding, strictly following these rules is vital. Atherton is continuing to develop his advice for shielding people and will send a letter to them in the next few weeks to set out the next steps, the Welsh Government said. Parents call for virtual school for Scottish pupils Some parents are calling for a Scotland-wide virtual school as anxieties grow at the prospect of indefinite home schooling into the autumn and beyond. While pupils transitioning into primary and secondary schools should be in class briefly before the summer holidays begin at the end of June, the majority of Scotland\u2019s schoolchildren with not return until 11 August, and then to a blended model of in-school and at-home learning. Libby Brooks has the full report: Crowds of protesters have also gathered in Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff in solidarity with the wave of demonstrations taking place across the US following the killing of an unarmed black man restrained by police. These Black Lives Matter demonstrations were organised across the UK \u2013 including in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square \u2013 after George Floyd died when a white officer held him down by pressing a knee into his neck last Monday in Minneapolis. Some London protesters, crowded together despite social distancing restrictions, held signs reading \u201cJustice for George\u201d and \u201cRest in power\u201d. Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said video footage of Floyd\u2019s death was \u201cvery distressing\u201d, but he would not comment on President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the widespread protests sparked by the killing. The president has been criticised after warning on Twitter that \u201clooting leads to shooting\u201d. He later attempted to clarify his words by further tweeting on Friday: Looting leads to shooting, and that\u2019s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don\u2019t want this to happen, and that\u2019s what the expression put out last night means. Raab told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I\u2019m not going to start commenting on the commentary or indeed the press statements that other world leaders make, or indeed the US president. What we do know is that the lead suspect has now been charged with murder, there is a federal review and we want to see de-escalation of all of those tensions and American come together. NHS England has announced 85 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,614. Of the 85 new deaths announced on Sunday: 15 occurred on May 30 31 occurred on May 29 seven occurred on May 28 The figures also show 22 of the new deaths took place between May 8 and May 27, nine occurred in April, and the remaining one death took place on March 25. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Sunday by NHS England show April 8 continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 894. The number of people to die after testing positive for Covid-19 in Scotland has risen by nine to 2,362, according to the Scottish government. The figures were revealed by health secretary Jeane Freeman during Sunday\u2019s press briefing on the Covid-19 response. The country has a total of 15,400 positive cases as of 9am on Sunday \u2013 an increase of 18 on the day prior. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran has said the government\u2019s decision to press ahead with reopening schools to more pupils on Monday is \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d . She said: Ministers have repeatedly claimed to be guided by science through this crisis yet a number of scientists - including members of Sage - have expressed concern about the easing of lockdown. It\u2019s deeply worrying that plans to reopen schools tomorrow are going ahead despite the fact that the Covid-19 risk is still classified as \u2018high\u2019. We all want to see children back in schools as an urgent priority. But not if this risks a new Covid-19 spike. The government must guarantee that public health will not be put at risk as a result of a premature or rushed effort to get children back into classrooms. Border dwellers grapple with English and Welsh lockdown rules The discrepancies in lockdown rules between the UK\u2019s four jurisdictions, from schools to exercise and social gatherings, has left those living in border areas of England and Wales grappling with conflicting guidelines. In the UK, Wales has arguably the strictest lockdown still in place. While people in England don\u2019t have a limit on the distance they can travel, those in Wales are still being told to \u201cstay local\u201d, and shops are likely to reopen later than England. My colleague Molly Blackall has the full report: The number of people to die after being infected with Covid-19 in Wales has risen by 11 to 1,342, Public Health Wales has announced. Another 82 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 13,995. Experts decry easing of coronavirus lockdown for England\u2019s shielders The government\u2019s surprise announcement that more than 2 million of the most vulnerable people will be allowed outside from Monday lacks any scientific rationale and amounts to a public relations exercise, a leading virus expert has said. Groups including the Residents and Relatives Association, which represents people in care homes, had called for steps toward lifting the tightest restrictions on the most vulnerable because of fears for their mental health, but the move came faster than many expected. Rob Burley, the director of campaigns at Muscular Dystrophy UK, said advice to shield people with muscle-wasting conditions was already confusing, but that the sudden change risked making things worse. \u201cWe are now faced with further confusion about why the advice has changed so suddenly when only a few weeks ago the government\u2019s recovery strategy said shielding would have to remain in place for a further period,\u201d he said.

The government must plug the gaps in statutory sick pay provision and not force people to choose between public health and paying their bills, Labour has said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government must extend the assistance so both people and businesses are supported when asked to comply with instructions to self-isolate under the new NHS Test and Trace system. If they do not, he warned, \u201cpeople will be expected to make an impossible choice between self-isolating or putting food on the table\u201d. He was speaking as Labour unveiled a three-point plan to get test and trace working locally as it described the government\u2019s current scheme as \u201ctotal chaos\u201d. The fact that businesses with more than 250 employees cannot claim back statutory sick pay (SSP) from the HMRC when employees have been told to self-isolate \u201crisks placing further financial stress\u201d on larger firms, Labour said. As the self-employed and low-paid do not qualify for sick pay at all and those who do receive one of the lowest rates in Europe, the party is calling on the government to urgently ensure people have what they need to meet basic living standards. Reynolds said: The Covid-19 crisis has exposed that our social security system is a safety net with too many holes in. The eligibility criteria for SSP has the same gaps, and if they are not filled, a cohort of people will be expected to make an impossible choice between self-isolating or putting food on the table. The government must consider how emergency support can be made available for people in this situation, or otherwise risk the success of the scheme and pushing those who do comply but cannot work as a result into further hardship. Here is a clip of hundreds of protesters kneeling in central London earlier today while chanting: \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d This act is symbolic of footage taken moments before Floyd\u2019s death, which showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. It also echoes a gesture made famous by NFL player Colin Kaepernick more than two years ago, after he refused to stand during the national anthem on multiple occasions to protest police brutality. Hundreds of protesters have gathered in central London in solidarity with waves of demonstrations that have rocked the US following the killing of George Floyd. Footage and pictures on social media show members of London\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cstop killing us\u201d in Trafalgar Square on Sunday. Protesters can be seen holding signs and wearing masks and gloves: Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black men spread across the US on Saturday night as mayors around the country imposed curfews and several governors called in the national guard amid scenes of violence, injuries and unrest. Read more about the latest developments in the US here: More than 2,500 Londoners have agreed not to pay rent so that they can afford food and other essentials amid the pandemic, campaigners have said. The London Renters Union (LRU) has been urging renters to sign up to its Can\u2019t Pay Won\u2019t Pay campaign since it launched on May 15. The people who have signed up have attended meetings to learn how tell their landlords they will be withholding rent, how to demand their landlord write off rent debt and also how to resist evictions, the LRU said. \u201cBecause of lockdown, this month I\u2019ve earned less than half of what I normally do, so it\u2019s been impossible to pay the rent,\u201d said Zara, a 40-year-old LRU organiser from east London. \u201cWe\u2019re not eligible for furloughing, self-employment support or Universal Credit. Our landlord already wanted to evict us, and now he\u2019s trying to get us declared bankrupt. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be worried that they might lose their home. I want to protect them from this.\u201d She urged the government to suspend rent, cancel rent debt and make the eviction ban permanent \u2013 accusing it of prioritising landlords\u2019 profit over renters\u2019 survival. No10 special adviser Dominic Cummings has been photographed, with characteristic plastic bag, outside his home in north London on Sunday: Nine-year-old Tobias Weller has completed his \u201cginormous challenge\u201d \u2013 walking a marathon outside his house using his walker over 70 days. Tobias \u2013 who has cerebral palsy and has been named Captain Tobias by his supporters in a nod to his inspiration, Captain Tom Moore \u2013 completed the distance on Sunday morning cheered on by his whole street in Sheffield. Police closed off the road as neighbours put out bunting and balloons for the final leg of his marathon fundraising effort. The young fundraiser has walked 750 metres of his 42,195-metre target each day and has raised more than \u00a343,000 for Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital and Paces School, his special school in the city. Weller was described as \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201can inspiration\u201d by Olympic heptathlon champion Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, professional footballer Esme Morgan and BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker ahead of him beginning the final leg on his journey on Sunday morning. Ennis-Hill said: I have been following your story and I just want to say I think you are absolutely incredible. What a challenge you\u2019ve taken on. How a decade of privatisation and cuts exposed England to coronavirus This latest Guardian investigation examines how a decade of privatisation, austerity and \u201creforms\u201d to public services enfeebled the state before the coronavirus struck \u2013 and how private contractors have been used to plug the void: Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has said that herd immunity \u201cwas never an aim\u201d of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and \u201cnever could be\u201d. In a piece first published in the Sunday Telegraph, Vallance sought to clarify \u201cexactly what Sage is, and what it is not\u201d after minutes from its meetings were made public for the first time this week following calls for greater transparency. On the release of the papers, Vallance said: Clearly it is right that ministers see the advice first and that they have a chance to consider it as part of their overall decision making, but I believe it is also right that the evidence base should become open for others to see too, so they can provide challenge and form new and important observations. Science advice to Cobr and to ministers needs to be direct and given without fear or favour. But it is advice. Ministers must decide and have to take many other factors into consideration. In a democracy, that is the only way it should be. The science advice needs to be independent of politics. The chief scientific adviser went on to say that Sage is \u201cnot an infallible body of experts\u201d and that its advice will not always be right. But he added that Sage \u201cendeavours\u201d to provide ministers with options to consider and to \u201cexplain the uncertainties and assumptions inherent in that science and evidence\u201d. He added that the publication of the papers would provide a chance to correct some \u201cmisconceptions that have taken hold\u201d. Specifically addressing accusations that Sage had proposed the government pursue a strategy of herd immunity early on in its response to the pandemic, Vallance said: Allowing many people to catch Covid to create widespread immunity was never an aim and never could have been with a committee comprised of many doctors who have spent their lives dedicated to improving health. Immunity on the other hand is something that prevents transmission and we all hope that a vaccine to induce immunity will become available. Ministers are acutely aware of the coronavirus crisis facing care homes in Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster has said. More than half of all Covid-19 deaths have occurred among frail and elderly care home residents. Providers have previously voiced concern about the provision of personal protective equipment and staffing levels amid the pandemic. Measures have been taken by the devolved administration in Belfast in response. Stormont\u2019s First Minister Foster told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: If we have a low number of deaths in the first place, then understandably you are going to have a concentration where there are old and vulnerable people. We are very, very conscious of the difficulties in care homes. We will look back and there will be plenty of time to look back at how we dealt with this virus. She said Northern Ireland\u2019s overall infection rate has been below that in England and Scotland because of a lower population density. She added lockdown restrictions were introduced earlier in the disease\u2019s spread in Northern Ireland. Care home residents account for 53% of all coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland, official statistics show. Of the 380 care home resident deaths in the year to May 22, 84% (318) occurred in their facility, with the remaining 62 taking place in hospital. The Department of Health has said there are 69 active care home outbreaks and 52 clusters have been closed. Local lockdowns could be used if coronavirus cases rise, says Raab The government could impose geographically targeted measures to combat coronavirus such as locking down specific cities if an easing of restrictions in England brings a rise in new cases, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary defended the decision to allow bigger outdoor gatherings and other new freedoms, which has prompted alarm from some government scientific advisers, but said he accepted it was a \u201cdelicate and dangerous moment\u201d. Asked what would happen if the relaxing of rules, which allow groups of up to six people to meet outdoors from Monday, brought a rise in infections, Raab said the government did not want to reimpose national restrictions. Peter Walker has the full report: The term \u201cLevel 1\u201d is currently trending on Twitter following the government\u2019s announcement that restrictions will be eased for extremely vulnerable people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d in England. It appears to be a reference to the government\u2019s Covid-19 alert level \u2013 a scale from one to five which reflects the degree of threat to the country from coronavirus. On Sunday, foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge that the level is currently transitioning from Level 4 to the less severe Level 3. Many on Twitter are accusing the government of easing restrictions in England as if the nation was at the least severe Level 1, while sharing the following graphic which appears to be from the Mail Online: The graphic indicates that \u201csports events return\u201d and \u201cvulnerable leave home\u201d at Level 1. An official government graphic representing the Covid-19 alert levels can be seen in this pdf slideshow. Unlike the Mail Online\u2019s version, it does not specify details around the return of sporting events or easing of restrictions for people who are shielding. The only action specified at Level 1 is \u201croutine international monitoring\u201d. However, the action at Level 4 appears to advise that \u201ccurrent social distancing measures and restrictions\u201d are maintained. \u2022 This section was amended on 4 June 2020 to clarify that restrictions are being eased in England. An entrepreneur has teamed up with medical experts to design a new protective product for treating coronavirus patients. The clear one-piece head box developed by Michael Knight shields clinical staff when they are performing procedures that result in patients expelling aerosol spray. Knight is managing director of County Down company Donite Plastics, which uses specialist heat technology \u2013 thermoforming \u2013 to mass produce moulded plastics. For the last six weeks he was been working with innovation experts from Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge to design the box for use when medics are intubating Covid-19 patients or connecting them to ventilators. As those procedures result in patients expelling spray, they bring with them a high risk of virus transmission. The inspiration for the project came during a conversation Knight had with a friend, Dr Madalina McCrea, who works as a consultant anaesthetist in Northern Ireland\u2019s Western Trust. Knight told the PA news agency: Mada knew I made things from plastic and we were chatting about a device that would sit over a patient\u2019s head, whether in a ward or an intensive care unit which would allow the medical practitioner to work on the patient, but also to protect them and the patient when carrying out procedures. There were pictures on the internet of very simple square acrylic boxes being used for this purpose in Taiwan during the height of their Covid-19 epidemic. Knight\u2019s daughter Sarah then put him in touch with a former colleague, Maighread Ireland, who is part of the clinical engineering innovation team at Addenbrooke\u2019s. He said: By coincidence, it turned out that Maighread had already been tasked by Addenbrooke\u2019s to investigate these head box devices. It made perfect sense then, that they would collaborate to develop a more sophisticated product suitable for use in the UK. The relaxing of lockdown measures for the 2.2 million extremely vulnerable people shielding in England lacks \u201cobvious rationale other than to add to an ongoing \u2018good news\u2019 narrative that appears to have little grounding in reality,\u201d an expert has said. Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019 School of Medicine, has said that there appears to be a lack of a \u201cclear explanation\u201d as to why the government is easing lockdown measures in England under the current circumstances. He said: As we have heard from Prof Van Tam, members of SAGE and its unofficial counterpart, and numerous other members of the scientific community, the daily case incidence, death rate and R0 in the UK does not represent a controlled, safe scenario. Test, track and isolate protocols are still being established and are largely untested on the scale necessary to ensure a safe route out of lockdown. Moreover, other relaxation measures recently announced mean that those venturing out will likely face difficulties in ensuring social distancing. What appears lacking from this, as well as other relaxation measures announced recently, is a clear explanation of precisely why it is felt that the situation justifies such actions. He added: We must also consider the effects that this announcement might have upon those currently shielding. How, without a clear rationale, are shielders supposed to judge whether it is indeed safe for them to alter their behaviour? The perception for many will be that it is safe, but this can also apply considerable emotional pressure to those most vulnerable to either comply, or to repeatedly have to justify why they might not feel comfortable now seeing loved ones or leaving the relative safety of their homes. Furthermore, should measures be further relaxed, shielders may experience difficulties relating to the workplace or childcare that were previously covered by simple criteria. It is imperative that the sacrifices made during lockdown are not undone by relaxing measures in haste. Clear guidelines in terms of why risks are now different are essential to provide the UK population with the tools to decide for themselves when it is safe. Coronavirus test and trace system \u2018creating false sense of security\u2019 Ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. They said that they were given details of their roles just four working days before Matt Hancock, the health secretary, launched test and trace last week. My colleagues Michael Savage, James Tapper and Sonia Sodha have the full report: The easing of lockdown might have to be done more subtly in different parts of the country which have experienced the virus to different levels, according government adviser professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College. He said it will be around two or three weeks before the effects of the latest easing of restrictions is known. He told the Andrew Marr show: It\u2019s going to be very patchy, it may be that actually easing lockdown is perfectly OK in areas like London which were hit early and hit hard, and where the epidemic seems to have been virtually passed in many parts of the community, with a few exceptions. But up north it\u2019s still a very large number of cases. I think we need to be more subtle about the geography and we need to look at the particular areas where it may be appropriate to ease lockdown. He added: Maybe there needs to be a bit more subtlety to the way in which lockdown is eased. MPs furious about forced return of \u2018physical voting\u2019 to Commons Older members of parliament and those with health conditions will be \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d and put at risk of contracting Covid-19 if they are forced back to the House of Commons for debates and votes this week, senior MPs have warned. A furious argument has broken out between backbench MPs of all parties and the government over plans which, if passed, will end all remote voting from this week and mean members have to attend in person. Parliament is resuming on Tuesday with the row still unresolved. Toby Helm has the full report: Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has said that it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d for her fellow cabinet member Rosie Duffield to resign for breaching lockdown rules. Duffield, MP for Canterbury and former Labour whip, apologised after it was revealed that she met her partner for a long walk in April while the pair were living separately, in breach of lockdown restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely correct she has taken responsibility for that and she has resigned,\u201d Dodds told the Andrew Marr show. Government scientific adviser professor Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College, has told BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that some of the people asked to shield from Covid-19 may not be as vulnerable as previously thought. Openshaw said that \u201chuge studies\u201d appear to have revealed that people who have recovered from cancer five years ago and are now well are \u201crelatively\u201d safe from the virus. He added that the same goes for people with asthma, unless they are on oral steroids. \u201cI think we are going to be able to fine tune the guidance now. I think that is really good news,\u201d he said. His comments come as the government plans to set out full guidance on how the 2.2 million extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus can safely venture out for the first time in months from Monday. Raab has told Sophy Ridge he is not sure when he became aware of Dominic Cummings\u2019 trip to Durham. \u201cWhen the story broke was when I first became aware of the detail of it,\u201d he said. Raab was acting prime minister at the time of Cummings\u2019 trip after Boris Johnson became infected with coronavirus and was admitted to hospital. \u201cI just knew [Cummings] was out of action because he had come down with coronavirus,\u201d Raab said. He added that he did not enquire into Cummings\u2019 personal circumstances at the time. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has told Sophy Ridge that the government is moving to step two of its roadmap to ease the lockdown as the UK transitions from Level Four to Level Three of the Covid Alert System. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress. Obviously this is a sensitive moment but we can\u2019t just stay in lockdown forever,\u201d he said. Ridge presses Raab on why the government is easing lockdown restrictions before it has reached Level Three. The official advice at Level Four is to maintain current lockdown measures, she said. Raab said: \u201cThe reason we are taking the steps that we are taking tomorrow \u2026 is precisely not just because the R level is down below one but also because we\u2019re making the progress on the data.\u201d Ridge asks Devi Sridhar, professor and chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University Medical School, whether it is inevitable that we will see an increase in Covid-19 cases as the lockdown eases. \u201cI am very sorry to say that I think it is inevitable looking at the numbers,\u201d Sridhar said. She said that the \u201conly thing that might save England is the good weather and the warmth\u201d if indeed the virus dies more quickly outside. She added: \u201cThe numbers are not low enough to have a testing and tracing system take over.\u201d Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has told Sophy Ridge that she supports calls to delay the reopening of schools in England until June 15. Primary schools in England are due to reopen to some pupils from Monday. The \u201cIndependent Sage\u201d group has advised that keeping lockdown measures in place for another two weeks will mean the rate of infection in children will have \u201cpassed\u201d, Bousted said. Labour\u2019s shadow communities secretary Steve Reed tells Sophy Ridge that there needs to be a set of \u201cclear national standards\u201d to help schools decide at a local level whether it is safe for them to reopen. Reid would not be drawn on what the cut off of point for closing or opening school should be. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision that should be taken locally, it\u2019s not up to me,\u201d he said. Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge asks Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon about the nation\u2019s higher death rate within care homes compared to England between March 16 and May 24. \u201cEvery single death from this virus is a matter of deep personal regret for me,\u201d Sturgeon said. Addressing the higher death rate in care homes Sturgeon said she does not \u201cbelieve that that is the case\u201d. She said that more deaths in care homes in Scotland have been attributed to Covid and believes it is a question of \u201cunderreporting\u201d in England. The government is to set out full guidance on how the 2.2 million extremely vulnerable people shielding from coronavirus can safely venture out for the first time in months from Monday, PA media reports. Boris Johnson praised their resilience as he said those shielding from Covid-19 in England will be able to spend time with other people outdoors. Communities secretary Robert Jenrick said the full guidance will be revealed on Sunday, as charities called for the scientific evidence behind the decision to be made clear and urged more help. Those considered extremely vulnerable will be able to go outside with members of their household from Monday, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. And those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household. Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks. Johnson said: We have been looking at how we can make life easier for our most vulnerable, so today I am happy to confirm that those who are shielding will be able to spend time outside with someone else, observing social distance guidelines. I will do what I can, in line with the scientific advice, to continue making life easier for you over the coming weeks and months. Jenrick said: Incidence rates of coronavirus are now significantly lower than before these measures were put in place. That\u2019s why we are focused on finding the right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the difficult situation more bearable - particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek. We will now be providing regular updates to the shielded to guide them through the next phase and, we hope, to better and less restrictive times. In the meantime we will continue to provide the support that the shielded in our communities need. Steven McIntosh, director of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said the decision was \u201ca step forward\u201d for a group who \u201chave felt left behind and forgotten\u201d as lockdown is eased for others in England. He said: For many, it\u2019ll be welcome advice that they can now choose to go outside for exercise or to meet people whilst socially distancing. But they still face heavy restrictions like being advised to avoid food shopping, going to pharmacies or their workplaces. The Government also hasn\u2019t yet delivered its commitment to provide greater help to this extremely vulnerable group, and Macmillan has heard from people living with cancer that existing \u2018shielding\u2019 support isn\u2019t getting through. So the Government must now set out how they will guarantee the needs of the most vulnerable and isolated are met. And Phil Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said people would want to hear the scientific evidence behind the decision. He said: Over 130,000 people live with MS in the UK and thousands of them have been left feeling forgotten after months of shielding. While for some it may be a relief that this relaxation is happening in England others have been left feeling confused. We\u2019re extremely concerned this news has come out of the blue - people who are extremely vulnerable will rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them. If the government is serious about supporting vulnerable people who are shielding they need more than just the ability to go outside. Crucially, we want to see better mental health support for everyone who needs it. Good morning and welcome to the Guardians\u2019 UK liveblog on the coronavirus pandemic. This is Aaron Walawalkar in London to steer you through the news. Leading our site this morning is Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Michael Savage\u2019s report on the fears of Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists that trust in government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair, posing a real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted on Monday. In a letter sent to No 10 on Friday, 26 senior UK academics and health administrators warn that public faith in the government is essential if the Covid-19 crisis is to be tackled effectively. The Sunday morning political shows are due to begin shortly. Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday will be joined by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat and Devi Sridhar, professor &amp; chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University Medical School. The Andrew Marr Show will feature shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster and government scientific adviser professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

      "bodyText": "The government claims to have exceeded its goal of a daily Covid-19 test capacity of 200,000 by the end of May. Boris Johnson set a target 200,000 tests a day earlier this month, but aides later said this referred to operational capacity rather than tests performed. On Saturday, 205,634 tests were available, meeting the target a day early, the government said. It did not release figures for the number of tests carried out. Experts questioned whether the theoretical capacity target was a meaningful way of assessing whether current levels of testing were adequate to support the newly launched track-and-trace programme. According to Department of Health figures, 127,722 diagnostic tests were performed on Saturday, of 165,634 available. There was further capacity for 40,000 antibody tests available to NHS and social care staff. The government has not released figures for how many antibody tests have been carried out, but NHS pathology labs are understood to have been given targets for performing thousands of tests a day since late last week. Testing capacity is reported by laboratories based on the their assessments of what they can deliver with the equipment and workforce available. Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cI think we need to be focused less on targets and more on getting in place the necessary local systems to do testing and tracing and isolating.

But riots have broken out nearby too. The police precinct of the officers who detained Floyd has been burned out.</p> <p>On Saturday night, crowds breaking curfew were met by massed state troops who overwhelmed them with tear gas, flash bombs and rubber bullets. Many locals barricaded businesses against looting and arson.</p> <h2>New York</h2> <p>Demonstrators marched across the Manhattan Bridge, which connects downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, on Saturday night. Thousands marched during the day in neighborhoods from Harlem and the East Village to Flatbush and Downtown Brooklyn, demanding an end to police brutality. Incidents involving Molotov cocktails and police vehicles driving into demonstrators were being investigated.</p> <h2>Los Angeles</h2> <p>A state of emergency was declared late on Saturday as two days of discord escalated with looting and vandalism. The authorities expressed support for peaceful protest but struggled to control eruptions of violence.

National guard troops were called in and violent confrontation ensued.</p> <h2>Salt Lake City</h2> <p>The capital of conservative Utah is not known as hotbed of unrest but a protest denouncing racism and deadly force by law enforcement turned violent on Saturday as protesters set cars on fire and threw rocks at businesses. Police responded with rubber bullets and arrests, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, adding that earlier, hundreds peacefully marched from the police department to the capitol.</p> <h2>Cleveland</h2> <p>Curfew is mandated from Sunday afternoon until 8am Monday morning after what started as a demonstration where people wore masks against the coronavirus and distributed hand-sanitizer, food and water escalated and businesses were smashed up.

Other Ohio cities Cincinnati and Columbus also experienced unrest.</p> <h2>Raleigh</h2> <p>Up to 1,000 protesters chanted \u201cWe want change\u201d and gathered, banging drums, in front of the courthouse in this North Carolina city.

Atlanta officials have blamed some out-of-area provocateurs for escalating demonstrations into violence in the city, a concern echoed by many other leaders, including in Minneapolis.

      "bodyText": "Protests have erupted across the US, from coast to coast and north to south, in reaction to the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis last Monday. Major cities from New York to Los Angeles and Miami to Seattle have seen a mix of peaceful demonstrations and violent outbreaks. Dozens of smaller cities also witnessed protests and fierce unrest. Under a hardline president gambling all to win re-election, the US is struggling to contain widespread anger over yet another killing of a black American by law enforcement officers, while under a coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 104,000 and cratered the economy, exposing stark inequality. Cities that became hotspots of unrest on Saturday night include: Minneapolis The intersection where George Floyd died is a mass of flowers and chalked tributes and hundreds have marched peacefully in his name. But riots have broken out nearby too. The police precinct of the officers who detained Floyd has been burned out. On Saturday night, crowds breaking curfew were met by massed state troops who overwhelmed them with tear gas, flash bombs and rubber bullets. Many locals barricaded businesses against looting and arson. New York Demonstrators marched across the Manhattan Bridge, which connects downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, on Saturday night. Thousands marched during the day in neighborhoods from Harlem and the East Village to Flatbush and Downtown Brooklyn, demanding an end to police brutality. Incidents involving Molotov cocktails and police vehicles driving into demonstrators were being investigated. Los Angeles A state of emergency was declared late on Saturday as two days of discord escalated with looting and vandalism. The authorities expressed support for peaceful protest but struggled to control eruptions of violence. Marchers in Beverley Hills chanted: \u201cEat the rich.\u201d Miami As curfew was lifted on Sunday morning, lines of police officers with helmets and shields were guarding police headquarters. Evidence of unrest ranged from \u201csystem broken\u201d spray-painted on a wall to carpets of broken glass and a burned-out squad car. Local media reported \u201cpassionate crowds\u201d in other Florida cities such as Tampa, Tallahassee, Coral Gables and Orlando, chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d. Nashville Organizers of an \u201cI will breathe\u201d rally against police mistreatment condemned those who veered from powerful protests in a park to chaotic nighttime marching that resulted in pockets of rioting and fires at the courthouse and city hall. National guard troops were called in and violent confrontation ensued. Salt Lake City The capital of conservative Utah is not known as hotbed of unrest but a protest denouncing racism and deadly force by law enforcement turned violent on Saturday as protesters set cars on fire and threw rocks at businesses. Police responded with rubber bullets and arrests, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, adding that earlier, hundreds peacefully marched from the police department to the capitol. Cleveland Curfew is mandated from Sunday afternoon until 8am Monday morning after what started as a demonstration where people wore masks against the coronavirus and distributed hand-sanitizer, food and water escalated and businesses were smashed up. Ohio governor Mike DeWine leaned on state and federal help and pledged to \u201cbring to justice those whose lawlessness escalated an otherwise peaceful protest to a riot\u201d. Other Ohio cities Cincinnati and Columbus also experienced unrest. Raleigh Up to 1,000 protesters chanted \u201cWe want change\u201d and gathered, banging drums, in front of the courthouse in this North Carolina city. Demonstrators later stood close to police in riot gear and shouted: \u201cWho do you protect? Who do you serve?\u201d When events turned tense then violent, as darkness fell, police fired smoke bombs and teargassed and pepper-sprayed the public and press. Louisville A third night of anger in Kentucky also marked the death in March of resident Breonna Taylor, when police raided her home while she slept in bed. Unrest over three nights has included multiple shootings, vandalism and looting. Taylor\u2019s sister Juniyah Palmer said the family wanted non-violent protest and those who escalated were \u201cno longer doing this for my sister\u201d. Atlanta A second day of protests saw 70 arrests and the deployment of troops ahead of further unrest in Savannah and other places across Georgia. Atlanta officials have blamed some out-of-area provocateurs for escalating demonstrations into violence in the city, a concern echoed by many other leaders, including in Minneapolis. Stores were ransacked on Friday but Saturday protests in Georgia were calmer. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson went on TV on Sunday morning to note that a majority of the 90 people arrested in the Texas city on Saturday were not from the area. San Antonio, Texas, is under curfew and Dallas is considering the same while religious leaders organise a prayer gathering on Sunday evening, \u201cfor justice and against racism\u201d. George Floyd was from Houston and the city\u2019s mayor said his body will be returning there for burial. Washington DC Protesters encircled the White House and crowds clashed with Secret Service officers, national park and metropolitan police officers for a second consecutive night. The presidential residence was guarded by armored vehicles and personnel as sweating, packed protesters eventually boiled over and threw fireworks and bottles, police swinging batons and firing pepper spay balls in response. Sporadic looting occurred elsewhere.",

The Movimento Estamos Juntos (We\u2019re In This Together Movement) was launched on Saturday as Brazil overtook France to become the country with the fourth highest official death toll. About a thousand coronavirus deaths are being confirmed each day as Latin America\u2019s biggest economy cements itself as a major focus of the pandemic. \u201cThe choice is between democracy and barbarity \u2026 It is our country\u2019s future that\u2019s at stake,\u201d tweeted Marcelo Freixo, a leftwing congressman, as he endorsed the movement\u2019s creation alongside leading lights of Brazilian academia, culture and politics.

They\u2019ve coped remarkably well, she said. Last autumn she was admitted to hospital so they know first-hand that their mum needs to be kept safe.</p> <p>The government could have come up with ways to make shielders feel safer leaving the house, said Gates. \u201cI read about how in Spain they had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelocal.es/20200430/spain-outlines-new-rules-and-time-slots-for-leaving-the-house-from-may-2nd\">designated times</a>&nbsp;when vulnerable people could go outside, knowing that only other shielding people would be out then. I like that idea \u2013&nbsp;even if it\u2019s just an hour a week. The other thing I wondered about was whether I could start socialising with other people who have been shielding for 10 weeks. They won\u2019t have Covid either, and it would mean I can see my sister-in-law and my father-in-law.\u201d</p> <p>She is reluctant to stop shielding without a personalised risk assessment from her doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how high my risk levels are on the general information from the government,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Esther Quaintmere, 32, a mechanical engineer from Cottingham in East Yorkshire, is also shielding because of a low white blood cell count, which leaves her susceptible to bacterial infections. She went outside for the first time 10 days ago after managing to speak to her consultant, who said she was statistically at low risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe consultant said that because I\u2019m a fit, healthy young woman and my bone marrow does make some white blood cells that I would be OK to go out for walks,\u201d she said. Without that information from someone she trusted, Quaintmere would still be holed up in a small terraced house with her mum, Jacqui Bruce, and boyfriend, Pip Hammond.</p> <p>Leaving the house after 60 days in isolation was a big deal for all of them, said Bruce: \u201cYour home becomes your security blanket.\u201d Without the consultant\u2019s reassurance, they wouldn\u2019t have crossed the threshold simply on the government\u2019s say-so, she added. \u201cI personally think the politicians are not listening enough to what the scientists are saying.\u201d</p>",

Her mother lives next door and has been helping out with the triplets but it has not been easy. \u201cBut we took the decision for Graham to keep working for the greater good, for the bigger picture.\u201d Helen Gates is a 39-year-old microbiologist who is on immunosuppressants for ulcerative colitis, an inflammation of the digestive system. She is also not going to be rushing out on Monday, especially as she lives in Morecambe, a seaside resort in Lancashire that has been flooded with visitors during the hot weather. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the last 10 weeks we have been told how vulnerable we are and how dangerous it would be for us to come into contact with someone who had the disease. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s changed really. Am I no longer as vulnerable? Or is it just that there is now enough capacity in the NHS if people like me do get ill?\u201d She has been isolating with her two daughters \u2013 Emily, 8, and Elizabeth, 10 \u2013 and husband Jono. He has been taking the girls out for walks but avoiding contact with others and they have not been able to play with their friends in the street since lockdown. They\u2019ve coped remarkably well, she said. Last autumn she was admitted to hospital so they know first-hand that their mum needs to be kept safe. The government could have come up with ways to make shielders feel safer leaving the house, said Gates. \u201cI read about how in Spain they had designated times when vulnerable people could go outside, knowing that only other shielding people would be out then. I like that idea \u2013 even if it\u2019s just an hour a week. The other thing I wondered about was whether I could start socialising with other people who have been shielding for 10 weeks. They won\u2019t have Covid either, and it would mean I can see my sister-in-law and my father-in-law.\u201d She is reluctant to stop shielding without a personalised risk assessment from her doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how high my risk levels are on the general information from the government,\u201d she said. Esther Quaintmere, 32, a mechanical engineer from Cottingham in East Yorkshire, is also shielding because of a low white blood cell count, which leaves her susceptible to bacterial infections. She went outside for the first time 10 days ago after managing to speak to her consultant, who said she was statistically at low risk. \u201cThe consultant said that because I\u2019m a fit, healthy young woman and my bone marrow does make some white blood cells that I would be OK to go out for walks,\u201d she said. Without that information from someone she trusted, Quaintmere would still be holed up in a small terraced house with her mum, Jacqui Bruce, and boyfriend, Pip Hammond. Leaving the house after 60 days in isolation was a big deal for all of them, said Bruce: \u201cYour home becomes your security blanket.\u201d Without the consultant\u2019s reassurance, they wouldn\u2019t have crossed the threshold simply on the government\u2019s say-so, she added. \u201cI personally think the politicians are not listening enough to what the scientists are saying.\u201d",

With the government calling a ceasefire on the last seven years of hostilities with the union movement as it attempts to reform Australia\u2019s industrial relations regime, the issue of wages has opened up as the first challenge. The Ai Group, in a supplementary submission to the annual wage review, argued against a wage increase for workers, claiming the economic conditions made it untenable. \u201cThis is the first time in the past 30 years that Ai Group has completely opposed a minimum wage increase, but a wage increase in the current circumstances would make no sense,\u201d the chief executive of the national employer association, Innes Willox, said. \u201cAwarding a minimum wage increase in this year\u2019s review would not be in anyone\u2019s interests \u2013 certainly not in the interests of low-skilled workers who would be much more likely to lose their jobs, or in the interests of the hundreds of thousands of workers who have joined the dole queues. Over the months ahead, during the recovery from the pandemic, the priority needs to be on assisting businesses to retain as many employees as possible and encouraging businesses to take on employees. McManus, one of the main stakeholders in Christian Porters\u2019 industrial relations reform roundtables, said the pandemic was not an opportunity for businesses to strip workers of wages. \u201cBusiness has consistently opposed real wage increases for working people \u2013 now they are advocating a real terms pay cut,\u201d she said. \u201cUndermining wage growth makes economic recovery harder and hurts our communities.\u201d The fair work commission is required to hand down its decision on the annual wage review by the end of June. Last year\u2019s annual wage review resulted in a 3% payrise for Australia\u2019s lowest paid workers, with the minimum wage increasing to $19.49 an hour, or $740.80 a week. The decision usually impacts around 2.2m people, but recent job losses in industries most reliant on minimum wage workers, including hospitality, have been vast, with at least 600,000 people losing their job in March and April, as the Covid-19 lockdowns took hold. Wage growth in Australia had stagnated even before the pandemic hit, with the government\u2019s 2019 economic forecast slashing projected wage growth from 2.75% in the April budget, to 2.5% by December that same year. A return to 3% wage growth was not forecast until 2022-23, a prediction which has been thrown out again by the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy. Late last year, Labor had calculated the average fulltime Australian worker would lose more than $2,000 over the next four years because of depressed wage growth. Australia\u2019s newest forecasts won\u2019t be released until the budget is handed down in October.",

as a result, such coverage puts substantial new audiences in contact with problematic content that they would not otherwise have encountered.</p> <p>\u201cTabloid media can therefore represent an important pathway for conspiracy theories to enter more mainstream public debate.\u201d</p> <p>The US president, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">signed an executive order last week</a> seeking to make social media sites liable for what their users post on the platform in retaliation for Twitter factchecking a tweet he posted containing a false assertion about mail voter fraud.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/5g-fires-australian-mobile-companies-work-with-police-to-prevent-arson-attacks\">5G fires: Australian mobile companies work with police to prevent arson attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peter Lewis, director of the Centre for Responsible Technology, said it was a good start for Twitter to factcheck Trump, but more needed to be done on bot networks to stop the spread of misinformation.</p> <p>\u201cSocial media companies need to take greater responsibility for disinformation on their sites, particularly where coordinated and automated retweeting is promoting dangerous disinformation,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhile Twitter is starting to call out some of President Trump\u2019s more egregious tweets, social media companies have a long way to go to stem the flow of divisive and dangerous disinformation on their platforms.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The report authors noted that while the research had focused on Twitter, the bot-like activity is not limited to Twitter, and has been something other platforms like Facebook had been grappling with.</p> <p>Facebook for its part has been factchecking select coronavirus claims, and banning some, including connecting 5G to the spread of coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Misinformation about the origins of Covid-19 is far more likely to be spread by pro-Trump, QAnon or Republican bots on Twitter than any other source, according to a study commissioned by the Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Responsible Technology. In late March, when the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold in the US and across much of the rest of the world, two researchers at Queensland University of Technology, Timothy Graham and Axel Bruns, analysed 2.6m tweets related to coronavirus, and 25.5m retweets of those tweets, over the course of 10 days. They filtered out legitimate accounts from those accounts most likely to be bots, which can be identified when they retweet identical coronavirus-related content within one second of each other. Through this methodology, the researchers found 5,752 accounts retweeted coronavirus-related material in a coordinated way 6,559 times. The researchers identified 10 prominent bot-like networks that were attempting to push political agendas, separate from those bot networks pushing commercial sites by hitching on to trending topics like coronavirus. The researchers found a coordinated effort to promote the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was a bioweapon engineered by China. The researchers identified a co-retweet network of 2,903 accounts with 4,125 links between them. Within this network, the researchers found 28 to 30 clusters of accounts which identified themselves as pro-Trump, Republican or associated themselves with the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory. There were 882 original tweets over the 10-day period pushing the bioweapon conspiracy theory, which were retweeted 18,498 times, and liked 31,783 times, with an estimated 5m impressions on Twitter. The researchers said the effect of the bot networks was the amplification of the misinformation. \u201cWhether the coordinated inauthentic behaviours we have observed for the bioweapon conspiracy are orchestrated by the hard core of participants in these groups themselves, or are designed by external operators to target and exploit the worldviews of such groups, the net effect is often the same: the themes and topics promoted by coordinated inauthentic activity are taken up by the wider fringe community, and thereby gain amplification and authenticity,\u201d the researchers said in the report. \u201cThe mis- and disinformation contained in the initial messages is no longer distributed solely by bots and other accounts that may be identified as acting in coordinated and inauthentic ways, but also and to a potentially greater extent by ordinary, authentic human users.\u201d From there disinformation can easily garner broader public attention when media, or people with large numbers of followers on social media, engage with the conspiracy theory, even if to refute it, they said. \u201cOfficial denials and corrections can perversely be exploited by the conspiracy theorists to claim that authorities are covering up \u2018the real truth\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cIn Australia, for example, the effects of this vicious circle are now being observed in the sharp rise in concerns about 5G technology \u2013 at least in part as a result of the circulation of the conspiracy theories about links between Covid-19 and 5G.\u201d The report authors recommend that platform operators get better at detecting and mitigating bot activity on their platforms, and mainstream media should be encouraged to reduce \u201cclickbait conspiracy theory coverage\u201d that has the potential to introduce new audiences to the misinformation . \u201cSuch sites may frame the conspiracy theories as outlandish or laughable, but often present them without significant correction or fact-checking; as a result, such coverage puts substantial new audiences in contact with problematic content that they would not otherwise have encountered. \u201cTabloid media can therefore represent an important pathway for conspiracy theories to enter more mainstream public debate.\u201d The US president, Donald Trump, signed an executive order last week seeking to make social media sites liable for what their users post on the platform in retaliation for Twitter factchecking a tweet he posted containing a false assertion about mail voter fraud. Peter Lewis, director of the Centre for Responsible Technology, said it was a good start for Twitter to factcheck Trump, but more needed to be done on bot networks to stop the spread of misinformation. \u201cSocial media companies need to take greater responsibility for disinformation on their sites, particularly where coordinated and automated retweeting is promoting dangerous disinformation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Twitter is starting to call out some of President Trump\u2019s more egregious tweets, social media companies have a long way to go to stem the flow of divisive and dangerous disinformation on their platforms.\u201d The report authors noted that while the research had focused on Twitter, the bot-like activity is not limited to Twitter, and has been something other platforms like Facebook had been grappling with. Facebook for its part has been factchecking select coronavirus claims, and banning some, including connecting 5G to the spread of coronavirus. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook should not factcheck in a similar way to Twitter, saying it shouldn\u2019t be the \u201carbiter of truth\u201d.",

Guardian Australia has spent the past week examining aspects of the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus, investigating problems with jobkeeper, the childcare support package, and the potential economic impact of the sudden cessation of stimulus. A critical part of the government\u2019s response was aimed at helping the highly concentrated and influential private pathology sector. The sector has played an important role, providing crucial testing capacity at a time of immense need. The sector also suffered a significant financial hit when non-Covid-19 testing declined in the middle of the pandemic. The sector has lobbied government, including through its peak group Australian Pathology, for assistance.

Waiving of approved collection centre registration renewal fees between 27 March and 30 September. The introduction of a moratorium on the opening of new pathology approved collection centres to replace any existing centre that closes down due to low testing volumes, between 27 March and 30 September. This has effectively shielded existing pathology providers from others taking over their newly vacant collection centres. Many collection centres are co-located within GP clinics and the rent is a critical source of revenue for GPs. The government also says it plans to offer additional financial assistance to private pathology companies which are not eligible for jobkeeper. The health department said the details are being worked on but the aim of the extra assistance is to help private pathologists retain permanent staff, and maintain rural or regional pathology collection and urban collection points in critical areas. The Australian Pathology chief executive, Liesel Wett, said the measures were crucial in supporting an important sector amid a significant downturn, caused by the drastic reduction in demand for non-Covid pathology during the crisis. \u201cHow critical were these measures? Extraordinarily critical, all of them,\u201d she said. Sonic \u2013 which, along with Healius, dominates the market \u2013 was also given a $22m contract to run a rapid Covid-19 collection and testing service for aged care facilities between 30 April and 30 September. The health department said the contract was awarded through a limited process due to the urgency of the situation. The department said it only approached major pathology providers with existing collection and testing capacity across at least one full state. No details were published on the government\u2019s public contract database, Austender, until questions from the Guardian. Sonic announced to the Australian Securities Exchange that about 2,700 aged care providers were eligible to use the service. A number of states and territories, including Western Australia, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory, told the Guardian they were not using the testing service that Sonic was contracted to provide. NSW said it has not \u201crequested Sonic Healthcare to conduct testing for any outbreak investigation in an aged care facility\u201d. During NSW\u2019s Newmarch House outbreak, the state government said it had the capacity to test every staff member of the aged care facility daily. A Queensland Health spokesman said: \u201cPathology Queensland is more than capable of meeting the public health system\u2019s needs in normal circumstances, including all public Covid-19 testing.\u201d The ACT said it had not yet used the Sonic service, though would consider doing so if there was a major outbreak at an aged care facility.

The federal health department acknowledged that \u201csome states have so far decided to do all aged care testing in public laboratories\u201d. \u201cThe tender was to provide a service that supplements, not replaces, existing public health pathology services in residential aged care facilities through the provision of services from the private sector as required,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Sonic Pathology Australia\u2019s chief executive, Ian Clarke, said the company had tested more than 1,000 residents of aged care facilities through the contract. He categorically rejected any suggestion that the tender was not open. \u201cIt was an open federal government tender that Sonic Pathology Australia participated in and was awarded,\u201d he said. \u201cSPA laboratories have for years performed more nursing home collections and testing than any other pathology provider, including the combined public sector which hasn\u2019t had much presence in that space.\u201d Jenny Sikorski, the chief executive of Public Pathology Australia, said her members had been testing in aged care facilities and \u201ccontinue to have the capacity\u201d. Sikorski said state and territory governments were being told they could now choose between public pathology and Sonic for their aged care testing. She said it was good to have additional capacity in the event that there were numerous outbreaks in aged care facilities at the same time, but that that hadn\u2019t yet occurred in Australia. As it stood, she added, the contract had created confusion. \u201cThe thing with the contract is that it has brought an element of confusion into who should be doing the testing, that hadn\u2019t been there before. That\u2019s the one thing it has created.\u201d",

However, your timeline (6 April) states that on that day the prime minister reported having mild symptoms and was still leading the government until the following Thursday or Friday.

Cummings claims that he did not tell the PM until the week following his trip to Durham, when they were both in bed, and that they both don\u2019t remember the conversation. This begs the question of whether the story by Cummings can be squared with the account of Johnson\u2019s activities; and if the PM was not in a state to be able to remember things during this week, why did he post a video on 1 April saying he would soon be back, with his aides announcing that he would be out of isolation on 3 April?

David Nash Oxford \u2022 The NHS website sets out very clear instructions on what to do when you suspect someone in your household may have Covid-19. It says: \u201cSelf-isolate if [\u2026] you live with someone who has symptoms [\u2026] If you\u2019re self-isolating, you and anyone you live with must not leave your home [\u2026] do not go to work [\u2026] do not go out\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 1 June. Top stories Violence and civil unrest continue to flare in the US after another night of protests over the police killing of George Floyd. Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, has denied that systemic racism exists in the country. His boss has tweeted that the US will be designating Antifa, a militant anti-fascist movement, as a terrorist organisation, continuing a habit of blaming violence during the protests on leftwing organisations. And Floyd\u2019s brother says a phone call from the president did little to assuage his hurt: \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. Journalists are reporting and recording being shot at, teargassed, arrested and intimidated and protesters chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d clashed with the Secret Service and police outside the White House overnight. Around the world people are expressing solidarity with the demonstrators and, in Australia, the family of David Dunday \u2013 an Aboriginal man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards in Sydney \u2013 said they have been traumatised anew by footage of Floyd\u2019s death. Research shows misinformation about the origins of Covid-19 is far more likely to be spread by pro-Trump, QAnon or Republican bots on Twitter than any other source. The study was commissioned by the Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Responsible Technology. There are fears the US protests could lead to a surge in coronavirus cases. The Minnesota governor urged demonstrators to wear masks and practice social distancing, while in Los Angeles testing centres closed due to safety concerns. Global coronavirus infections have passed the 6m mark as Latin America hit the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths, half of them in Brazil. The Australian government gave private pathology companies lucrative contracts to test for Covid-19. A Guardian Australia investigation reveals major pathology companies were handed lucrative contracts through limited tenders, closed collection centres were shielded from takeover, and the Coalition provided large subsidy increases after industry lobbying. The health department said the contract was awarded through a limited process due to the urgency of the situation, and the Australian Pathology chief executive says all the measures provided were \u201cextraordinarily critical\u201d to support the sector. Australia The mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised to traditional owners in Western Australia\u2019s north after destroying a significant Indigenous site dating back 46,000 years. Rio detonated explosives in part of the Juukan Gorge last Sunday, destroying two ancient rock shelters, which devastated the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people. The federal government has announced a \u201climited capacity\u201d return to mutual obligation requirements for Australia\u2019s welfare recipients from next week. Mutual obligations had been paused at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis but the government now says a three-phase reintroduction will begin this month. Australian unions have warned against any push for effective pay cuts. The union leader Sally McManus gave the warning after the Australian Industry Group called for no increase to the minimum wage amid the coronavirus pandemic recovery. Scott Morrison has confirmed that he has been in talks with the US about attending the postponed G7 summit. Donald Trump has said the current G7 membership does not adequately represent \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in the world\u201d, and specifically cited Australia, Russia, South Korea and India as possible additions. The world Two Nasa astronauts have docked the SpaceX Dragon crew capsule to the International Space Station in another milestone moment for their historic mission. SpaceX confirmed docking had been made at 10.16am ET above the China-Mongolia border. Senior public health officials in the UK have made a last-minute plea for ministers to scrap an imminent easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England. Experts are warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection and that public resolve to take steps to limit transmission has been eroded. Prominent figures from across Brazil\u2019s political spectrum have a published a high-profile manifesto calling for a united front to protect democracy and lives. It comes amid growing alarm over President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s authoritarian outbursts and shambolic response to coronavirus. Recommended reads Finally there is real movement on Australia\u2019s climate policy \u2013 but time isn\u2019t on our side. Anna Skarbek, chief executive of the independent not-for-profit ClimateWorks Australia, writes that if speed weren\u2019t a factor, we could rely on the market to incentivise green technology at its own pace. But she says we have entered a crucial decade in the race against climate change. Operation Buffalo, ABC TV\u2019s comedy/drama about nuclear testing at Maralinga, never quite finds its balance, writes Luke Buckmaster. The six-part series is set in the mid-1950s and is inspired by real events in the South Australian outback. With a \u201cuniformly strong\u201d cast and a skilled cinematographer, the series veers between sly comedy and darker drama \u2013 and, according to this review of the first three episodes, it doesn\u2019t always stick the landing. After months of dramatically reduced freedoms, the shock of getting back to normal can be jarring. Take a lesson in readjustment from three people who\u2019ve been through this before \u2013 the New Zealand mountaineer Peter Hillary, the astronaut Andy Thomas and the intrepid sailor Jessica Watson. All of them say the process of change brings difficulty and opportunity. Listen Full Story examines how a national security law is leading to secret trials in Australia. Last week, in a courthouse in Canberra, reporters were handed a statement by the defendant as they walked out the door. It simply read: \u201cI am unable to say much and you are unable to report much, this is the state of our now fragile democracy.\u201d The Guardian Australia reporter Christopher Knaus explains how this trial came about, and the law that\u2019s allowed this story to be shrouded in secrecy.

Tom Trbojevic put on a show, scoring a double and setting up three tries for Manly, seemingly emerging from the lockdown as a better player than when he went in. Media roundup The Nationals MP George Christensen set up a website backing his push for a China inquiry which is linked to a business promoting sugar pills to treat urinary tract infections, reports the Age today. ABC News is reporting that fraudsters have been stealing Australians\u2019 superannuation through the Covid-19 early access scheme. The Australian has a story about the suspension of Australia\u2019s immigration pipeline shrinking the economy by up to $40bn a year. And, if you missed it at the weekend, the Saturday Paper examined one Queensland town\u2019s decades-long legal fight against being subsumed by a coalmine. Coming up Ben Fordham takes over Alan Jones\u2019 radio show from today. An appeal judgment is expected over the Northern Territory youth detainee Dylan Voller\u2019s successful defamation action. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 Tobias Weller, a nine-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and autism, has raised \u00a360,000 for charity by walking up and down his Sheffield road for 70 days. He originally wanted to do a 1km sponsored walk in his local park but when England\u2019s lockdown descended he decided to complete a marathon by walking up and down the Sheffield road where he lives. His 70-day journey raised tens of thousands of pounds more than his initial goal of \u00a3500.

Sounding the alarm as Covid-19 crushes production levels and puts growing numbers of firms on the brink of collapse, the industry group Make UK said ministers needed to step in with direct state support to ensure the short-term survival of firms. Britain\u2019s foremost manufacturing group \u2013 which represents 20,000 companies of all sizes in engineering, manufacturing, technology and the wider industrial sector \u2013 said highly skilled jobs and critical supply chains across all regions of the country were at risk without direct support from the state. The request comes as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, considers using an emergency budget this summer to speed Britain\u2019s economic recovery as lockdown measures are lifted. Such is the crisis gripping much of industry, The Sunday Times reported that the chancellor is working on plans for a set-piece spending event in parliament during the week of 6 July. Sunak could use an emergency budget this summer as part of broader plans alongside No 10 to revitalise the economy, as the country slowly emerges from harsh controls on business and social life. However, it is understood the chancellor could announce additional measures to support jobs and growth without needing to stage a full budget before the autumn. It emerged last weekend that the Treasury had drawn up plans for the taxpayer to step in and rescue struggling companies to prevent a wave of job losses in sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis. Under the plan named Project Birch, the government would support companies as a last resort. Make UK said the extent of the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis and lockdown measures was so widespread that failure to provide direct support this year could drive companies to the wall. Urging the government to step in, it said firms would need help to service debts they had accumulated during the crisis, and that firms in aerospace, automotive and steel would benefit most from direct aid. Bailouts could take the form of equity stakes in struggling firms with tough conditions to ensure the best use of public money. An alternative option could be to extend the government\u2019s loan guarantee schemes. Ministers have come under pressure from Labour and campaigners to ensure government support comes with obligations, including bans on dividends, big executive bonuses and forcing companies to meet environmental targets. Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said manufacturing firms were often anchors of their local economies and the government needed to take a more strategic approach to supporting the industry. \u201cEquity support must be linked to supporting employment, adhering to environmental requirements, and delivering long-term value for money by preventing short-term dividend payments, share buybacks, and poor tax practice,\u201d she said. Other major countries have taken such an approach, including France, where Air France has been forced to cut back its domestic routes if train journeys could be used as an alternative in exchange for a \u20ac7bn (\u00a36.3bn) government bailout. Business surveys show UK factory output has plunged the most since comparable records began more than two decades ago. The number of cars made last month \u2013 one of the country\u2019s key industrial sectors \u2013 plunged by 99.7% in April, with just 197 cars rolling off production lines across the country. With the government planning to scale back its emergency furlough support scheme from August, Make UK said the scale of the damage meant many firms would not be able to take people off furlough and would resort to substantial redundancies. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, said: \u201cThey have now been driven to the cliff edge by the nature of this crisis and may not survive without direct government intervention.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Treasury said it had already provided an unprecedented package of support, including more than \u00a340bn in loans and guarantees, cash grants to three quarters of a million firms and paying the wages of 8.4 million furloughed workers. \u201cThe engineering and manufacturing industry will be able to draw upon these measures to help them through the coronavirus pandemic, as well as time to pay flexibilities with tax bills and VAT deferrals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to regularly engage with businesses across all sectors.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland faces a \u201cpotent threat\u201d to its prosperity and stability if reduced business confidence due to uncertainty over post-Brexit trading rules compounds the economic damage from coronavirus, a Lords committee has warned. A fourth round of talks between the UK and EU over a permanent deal begins this week, with little apparent progress made, and the looming deadline of 1 July for the UK to seek an extension to the transition period beyond this year. Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled this out, while the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has urged the UK to stick to its commitments, saying Brussels will not be pushed into \u201cagreement at any cost\u201d. If no agreement can be reached, the greatest impact could be felt in Northern Ireland, which will follow EU rules on agriculture and manufactured goods, and where there will be some checks on shipments from England, Wales and Scotland. In a report the House of Lords European Union committee said the continued uncertainty could prompt businesses in the rest of the UK to think again about investing in Northern Ireland. \u201cThere is a real danger that businesses based in Great Britain could conclude that it is economically unviable to continue to operate in Northern Ireland, leading in turn to reduced choice and higher costs for Northern Ireland consumers, thus undermining Northern Ireland\u2019s economic model, its future prosperity and, potentially, its political stability,\u201d the peers said. Northern Irish businesses have also been hampered in their preparations for the new potential trading regime by the impact of coronavirus, the report said. It concluded: \u201cThe combination of uncertainty, lack of momentum and lack of time, compounded by the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic, is a potent threat to economic prosperity and political stability in Northern Ireland.\u201d Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, called on Sunday for any checks on goods entering to be as limited as possible. \u201cWhat we have to do now is minimise those checks and make sure that they do not damage the economy of Northern Ireland,\u201d the DUP leader told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cThe best way to protect the Belfast agreement and the people of Northern Ireland is to make sure that there are not unnecessary checks and the economy suffers as a result of the Northern Ireland protocol.\u201d The last round of talks saw seemingly minimal progress, with Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, exchanging bad-tempered letters. Frost\u2019s letter in particular raised hackles in Brussels by accusing the EU side of treating the UK as an \u201cunworthy\u201d partner in offering a trade agreement that would force the country to \u201cbend to EU norms\u201d. Speaking to the Sunday Times ahead of the next round, Barnier appeared similarly pugnacious, saying failing to reach a deal would bring \u201ceven more consequences\u201d than before given the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSo, I think we have a joint responsibility in this very serious crisis, which affects so many families, with so many deaths, so many sick people, so many people unemployed, to do everything we can to reach an agreement and I very much hope that we will do so,\u201d he said. Barnier said Britain had been \u201ctaking a step back \u2013 two steps back, three steps back\u201d from the commitments made in the departure deal signed by Boris Johnson. \u201cThe UK negotiators need to be fully in line with what the prime minister signed up to with us,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause 27 heads of state and government and the European parliament do not have a short memory.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A million children in England \u2013 half of those who are expected to return when their classes reopen \u2013 are likely to stay at home on Monday rather than go back to school, as many parents, councils and teachers remain sceptical of the government\u2019s assurances over their safety. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has invested considerable political capital in opening classrooms to primary school pupils in three year groups \u2013 reception, year 1 and year 6 \u2013 leading to warnings by independent scientists that it is too soon to reopen while transmission and infection rates remain so high. While most of England\u2019s 18,000 primary schools will open to more pupils from Monday, a large majority of headteachers say they are not able to accommodate all three year groups, in some cases for the remainder of the school year. According to a survey conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research, primary school leaders expect that 47% of families will keep their children home, with the proportion rising to 50% among pupils eligible for free school meals. With more than 2 million children in England in reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, about 1 million are likely to stay at home when schools open to pupils other than those of key workers and those in care or having a social worker. In an effort to encourage parents to return their children to school, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: \u201cWhile there might be some nervousness, I want to reassure parents and teachers that the welfare of children and staff continues to be the heart of all of our considerations.\u201d Williamson said the government\u2019s five tests for the safe lifting of the lockdown had been met, and claimed that it had \u201creviewed all the evidence\u201d before reopening schools to more pupils. However, since the end of last week a number of leading scientists, including some who sit on the government\u2019s advisory Sage panels, have said that it is too soon for the UK\u2019s lockdown to be lifted because Covid-19 infection continues to spread in the community. Steve Reed, Labour\u2019s shadow communities secretary, said: \u201cAll of us want to see schools open, but it has to be done in a gradual way that maintains parents\u2019 confidence that it\u2019s safe for their child to go back.\u201d The NFER survey found that disadvantaged families and those living in the north of England were the most reluctant to return their children to school. Schools with high numbers of families eligible for free school meals expected 50% of pupils to stay away, compared with 42% in schools with the least disadvantaged children. Meanwhile, schools in the north-west of England expected half of their families to keep children at home, compared with 41% on average for schools in the south-west. \u201cSchools with a high proportion of free school meal children were the most affected before lockdown and expect fewer children to return, adding to concerns about their loss of learning,\u201d said Carole Willis, the NFER\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere needs to be very clear messages and reassurance for parents, as well as a continued focus on the quality of remote learning.\u201d The NFER\u2019s findings backed up a new straw poll taken by the National Association of Head Teachers, which found that just 12% of school leaders said they would be able to accommodate all of the children allowed back on Monday. More than 10% of headteachers said they would not be able to reopen to more pupils either this week or next week, and the remaining 78% said they would only be able to take a smaller number of children, or would be rotating classes between different days. A number of councils remain opposed to the government\u2019s 1 June reopening, including some on the opposite ends of the political spectrum. Conservative-controlled Lancashire county council advised its schools not to reopen, saying that the government\u2019s test and trace programme \u201cis not at a state of readiness to respond to Covid-19 community setting outbreaks in a timely manner. \u201cFurthermore, we are not confident that adjustments to the current measures of the lockdown policy will not risk a second peak of infections locally.\u201d Meanwhile, Brighton and Hove city council, which has more Green party than Conservative councillors, also advised its schools not to reopen for the same reasons. The Church of England\u2019s Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham also made a late decision not to reopen its 65 primary schools on the grounds of safety concerns raised by staff unions. \u201cWhile we very much want as many children in school as possible, it\u2019s so important to do this the right way,\u201d Nigel Frith, the diocesean director of education, wrote to parents. The decision was attacked by Ben Bradley, the Tory MP for Mansfield, who accused the diocese of \u201cbowing to union pressure\u201d. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, provided little reassurance at Sunday\u2019s afternoon press conference to parents when she dismissed the chances of public playgrounds reopening. Harries said park playgrounds remained risky because of the danger of transmission when children from \u201cmultiple households\u201d meet. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good place to be at the moment so I think not in the immediate future,\u201d she said. The wider opening only applies to schools in England \u2013 schools in Wales will not reopen on Monday but Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, is to make a further announcement this week. Schools in Northern Ireland and Scotland will not widely reopen until the end of the summer holidays, although in Scotland preschool children in nursery classes and pupils in P7, the final year of primary school, could return on 15 June in some areas.",

The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong.</p> \n  <p>Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy.

The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump postpones G7 summit and signals wider attendance list. </strong>In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/donald-trump-postpones-g7-summit-and-signals-wider-attendance-list-in-future\">postponed the Group of Seven</a> summit that he wanted to hold in June. He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. </strong>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/key-election-battlegrounds-face-double-hit-from-brexit-and-coronavirus\">Brexit and coronavirus</a> should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pressure builds on South African president. </strong>South African president Cyril Ramaphosa faces a fresh leadership test over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation prepares to reopen its economy on Monday. South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 500,000. </strong>Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. </strong>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. </strong>Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. </strong>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.

Many thanks to everyone who wrote in. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Alison Rourke in Sydney. The US has supplied Brazil with 2 million doses of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, despite medical warnings about the risks associated with it. This comes only days after the WHO suspended testing it on Covid-19 patients due to health concerns. Leaders and public health officials across the US are warning about a potential spike in coronavirus infections resulting from the escalating protests over the death of George Floyd. Some have grown alarmed due to images of mass gatherings, where many of the demonstrators are not wearing masks. Poverty in the occupied West Bank may double as Palestinians are hammered by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank has warned. Despite low infection rates, the pandemic is having a devastating economic effect due to loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. In England, senior public health officials have made a last-minute plea for ministers to stop Monday\u2019s easing of the lockdown, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection. They said the new rules, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens, were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d. More that 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Chile, the health ministry has reported, with 827 of the deaths occurring in May alone. The country has had 99,688 confirmed cases and 1,054 deaths. El Salvador\u2019s congress has passed a new emergency bill to gradually reopen the Central American nation\u2019s economy, however, president Nayib Bukele has vowed to veto the measure. Bukele argues it is too risky to reopen the country at this point. South Africa has delayed Monday\u2019s reopening of schools by a week, the Department of Basic Education has announced, saying that many are not ready to welcome back pupils. Unions have said schools do not have protective equipment to keep teachers and pupils safe, while a quarter of rural schools lack running water for hand-washing. India prepares to reopen country except for \u2018containment zones\u2019. Prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has extended lockdown until 30 June in a number of zones identified as \u2018high-risk\u2019 by individual states, while the rest of India prepares to reopen. The number of cases confirmed in India has reached a daily record high during the past 48 hours, and critics argue Modi is leaving the responsibility of dealing with the virus up to individual states. The premier of Victoria, Australia, has urged people to continue to work from home if possible. Daniel Andrews raised the issue of the infection risks involved in sharing office spaces, as well as commuting. Poverty in the occupied West Bank may double as Palestinians are slammed by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank has warned. The Palestinian territories have seen low infection rates after acting quickly to curtail the spread of Covid-19, with three deaths out of 450 cases registered among some five million residents in Gaza and the West Bank, AFP reports. But the Palestinian Authority\u2019s financial situation is \u201cexpected to become increasingly difficult\u201d due to loss of income and increased spending on healthcare and other areas, the World Bank said in a report. The fallout is expected to see the number of households living below the poverty line increase this year from 14 to 30% in the West Bank, largely due to Palestinians being unable to cross into Israel for work. The Palestinian Authority last week announced an end to the lockdown it had imposed in early March across the West Bank after an outbreak of the Covid-19 illness in the biblical city of Bethlehem. The easing allowed more than 63,000 Palestinians to pass through checkpoints for work on Sunday, according to the Israeli military branch handling civilian affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories. The borders of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007, remain closed to all but a few returning Gazans, who are quarantined on arrival. The poverty rate was already 53% in Gaza before the pandemic and the World Bank forecast it would jump to 64% this year. Overall, the Palestinian economy is set to shrink between 7.6 and 11%, the global body said, a severe downturn after one percent growth in 2019. The US has supplied Brazil with 2 million doses of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, despite medical warnings about the risks associated with it. The two governments released a joint announcement just days after the WHO suspended testing it on Covid-19 patients due to health concerns. Both presidents have promoted its use, despite the US Food and Drug Administration issuing a warning about its use against the virus. \u201cThe American and Brazilian people stand in solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are announcing the United States Government has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the people of Brazil. \u201cHCQ will be used as a prophylactic to help defend Brazil\u2019s nurses, doctors and healthcare professionals against the virus. It will also be used as a therapeutic to treat Brazilians who become infected. The countries will also carry out a joint research effort, including \u201crandomised controlled clinical trials\u201d, and the US has pledged to send 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. Egypt has shortened its night curfew by one hour despite recording high daily increases in both deaths and cases. The health ministry announced 1,536 new cases had been confirmed, including 46 deaths. The total caseload now stands at 24,985, while the toll is at 959. The night curfew has been tweaked, ending at 5am rather than 6am. Officials have indicated they are looking to slowly relax restrictions and revive economic activity despite the rising number of infections. The government announced that the number of hospitals designated to deal with coronavirus cases is rising to 376 from 340, and the number of laboratories capable of processing test results to 57 from 49. Hospitals assigned to treat coronavirus patients have 3,539 intensive care unit beds and 2,218 ventilators, a government statement said. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally on Sunday on horseback as supporters called for the Supreme Court to be shut down for investigating the right-wing leader, as one of its justices compared the risks to Brazil\u2019s democracy with Hitler\u2019s Germany. Deepening a political crisis during one of the world\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks, Bolsonaro has slammed the top court for investigating his interference in police affairs and opening an inquiry into his supporters\u2019 alleged libel and intimidation campaigns on social media. He has denounced the investigations, suggesting \u201cabsurd orders\u201d should not be followed and warning that the court may \u201cplunge Brazil into a political crisis.\u201d Supreme Court Justice Celso de Mello, who is responsible for investigating a former justice minister\u2019s allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle with law enforcement for personal reasons, said the president\u2019s supporters were seeking a military dictatorship. \u201cWe must resist the destruction of the democratic order to avoid what happened in the Weimar Republic when Hitler, after he was elected by popular vote ... did not hesitate annulling the constitution and imposing a totalitarian system in 1933,\u201d de Mello told other judges in a message seen by Reuters and reported in Brazilian newspapers. Bolsonaro has said his aims are democratic and accused his opponents of going against the constitution. On Saturday night, a group of masked backers of Bolsonaro marched to the court carrying torches to call for its closure. During Sunday\u2019s demonstrations in Sao Paulo, opponents of Bolsonaro took to a main avenue to protest against \u201cfascism\u201d and clashed with riot police who intervened, using tear gas, to stop them getting close to a rally by supporters of the president.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported a total 1,761,503 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 23,553 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths in the country had risen by 915 to 103,700. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Here\u2019s a quick summary for those who are just waking up, or anyone else looking for a wee recap. The global caseload has passed six million, standing at 6,083,633, according to Johns Hopkins University tracker. Spain\u2019s PM is seeking a two-week extension of the country\u2019s state of emergency, which will take the lockdown up to 21 June. Iran has recorded over 150,000 confirmed infections, with 2,516 recorded in the past 24 hours. In the UK, health officials have made a last-minute plea to stop the lockdown easing set to take place tomorrow, saying the new rules are \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d. In other last minute decisions, South Africa has delayed the reopening of schools - due tomorrow - by a week due to safety concerns. Chile has passed the grim milestone of 1,000 deaths, with 827 deaths recorded in May alone. The country is approaching 100,000 confirmed cases. And here are the developments in more detail for those who want the full run-through. While the rest of India prepares to reopen, individual states are identifying high-risk zones where lockdowns will stay in place. Prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has extended lockdown until 30 June in these \u2018containment\u2019 zones that continue to report high infection numbers. Outside the zones, restaurants, malls and religious buildings will be allowed to reopen from 8 June, in a relaxation of the world\u2019s longest coronavirus lockdown. The number of cases confirmed in India has reached a daily record high during the past 48 hours, and critics argue Modi is leaving the responsibility of dealing with the virus up to individual states. In India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, 1,111 zones have been identified, while in Gujarat over 400,000 houses were marked as high-risk zones. Officials in the western state of Maharastra said all markets, except malls and congested spaces, will be allowed to function in a staggered manner. The eastern state of West Bengal identified 285 containment zones in its capital, Kolkata. India has reported 182,000 confirmed cases, with 5,164 deaths. The airport in the Namibian harbour town of Walvis Bay has closed after two people tested positive for the coronavirus and the economic hub went into lockdown. The airport would be closed for seven days, manager Chrizelda George told media on Sunday. A third Walvis Bay resident, a colleague of one of the patients, has since tested positive, bringing the total infections nationwide to just 24 with no deaths. Other airports in the country will still allow domestic flights as scheduled and for emergency evacuations. Namibia\u2019s flag carrier, Air Namibia, has also suspended all flights in and out of Walvis Bay until 8 June. Most of the desert nation in southwest Africa, which has received international praise after recording so few cases, will ease restrictions from Tuesday. South Africa has pushed back Monday\u2019s reopening of schools by a week, the Department of Basic Education has announced, saying that many are not ready to welcome back pupils. The plan for grades 7 and 12, the last years of primary and secondary school respectively, to return on Monday were scrapped following teachers\u2019 unions and governing associations urging school staff to defy the government order, saying schools did not have protective equipment to keep educators and pupils safe. Many of South Africa\u2019s state schools are in poor condition, especially in rural areas, and analysts say that a quarter of them have no running water, making hand-washing nearly impossible. The department said its decision followed three reports by industry players that raised concerns about the state of readiness. \u201cThe Council of Education Ministers was concerned that, in some provinces, personal protective equipment for learners in particular had not been received and some schools had not been made ready for the arrival of teachers and learners,\u201d it said. On Monday schools will reopen only for management teams, teachers and non-teaching staff for instruction on health and safety measures, to finish cleaning and focus on supply chain matters. More that 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Chile, the health ministry has reported, with 827 of the deaths occurring in May alone. The country has had 99,688 confirmed cases of the disease so far, and 1,054 deaths. \u201cWe know we are in the most difficult weeks,\u201d undersecretary of health Paula Daza said in a televised address. \u201cWe are making decisions and taking measures every day to contain the spread.\u201d El Salvador\u2019s Congress has passed a new emergency bill to address the impact of the coronavirus crisis and gradually reopen the Central American nation\u2019s economy, while president Nayib Bukele has vowed to veto the measure. Bukele argues it is too risky to reopen the country at this juncture. The country has registered 46 deaths from coronavirus and a total of 2,517 cases. Congress voted 56 to 6, with one abstention, late on Saturday to pass the bill that would establish guidelines for restarting production, outline workers\u2019 rights, and regulate quarantines. The president has asked Congress to prolong the current quarantine measures for another 15 days. \u201cThey know that this bill will be vetoed. Their interest is not to reactivate the economy. They are even less interested in people\u2019s lives and health. Their job is to trip up the government,\u201d Bukele wrote on Twitter. Bukele has repeatedly angered rights groups, who say he has shown authoritarian tendencies, and clashed with lawmakers. In February, Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied congress. Bosnia\u2019s state court has ordered the release of a regional prime minister and two other men suspected of corruption in connection with the import of defective ventilators for coronavirus patients. The court of Bosnia-Herzegovina said their detention was unnecessary, and turned down the prosecution\u2019s requests to detain the three men for 30 days. Fadil Novalic, prime minister of the autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, had been held since Thursday, first in police custody and then in the state prosecution where he was questioned. Also released were Fahrudin Solak, an official in charge of procuring equipment to combat the outbreak, and Fikret Hodzic, owner of a raspberry processing firm that procured the ventilators. While they have not been formally charged, they have been accused of abuse of office, taking bribes and money laundering. Solak and Hodzic were additionally accused of forging official documents. They deny all wrongdoing. Senior public health officials have made a last-minute plea for ministers to scrap Monday\u2019s easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection and that public resolve to take steps to limit transmission has been eroded. The Association of Directors of Public Health said new rules, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens, were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d and that pictures of crowded beaches and beauty spots over the weekend showed \u201cthe public is not keeping to social distancing as it was\u201d. Read Robert Booth, Helen Pidd and Peter Walker\u2019s report on the eleventh-hour plea here. Around 65% of small Israeli start-ups expect to cease operations in the next six months due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, a poll has shown. The survey, conducted by the Israeli Innovation Authority - a state agency that finances start-ups - and a group of tech industries, paints a gloomy picture of future in the self-styled \u201cstart-up nation\u201d, where the high-tech sector accounts for 10% of jobs. The country\u2019s economy was in full swing with unemployment at 3.4% in February, before the coronavirus pandemic struck a devastating blow to the global economy. Joblessness has since surged to a peak of 27%. According to the survey of the heads of 414 high-tech healthcare, software, hardware and communications companies, more than a third have put staff on leave of absence during the pandemic. Israel has recorded more than 17,000 infections and more than 280 deaths out of a population of nine million. Crowds of protesters gathered in parts of the UK in solidarity with the unrest across the US after the killing of George Floyd. In London, hundreds gathered in Trafalgar Square before marching to the US embassy. As they walked chants could be heard of \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and the name of the organisers, Black Lives Matter. Here are some of the key coronavirus developments from over the last few hours. The global death toll has passed 370,000. The coronavirus death toll now stands at 370,078, according to Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. There have been 6,104,980 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide. Spain\u2019s prime minister has confirmed his government will seek a sixth and final extension to the coronavirus state of emergency, to continue until 21 June. The country\u2019s state of emergency has been in effect since 14 March. S\u00e1nchez said the extension is necessary and warned against complacency. Abu Dhabi has announced it will cordon off the UAE\u2019s capital as well as banning travel between regions within the emirate for a week from Tuesday to control the spread of the coronavirus. The new restrictions will mean residents will need a permit to make the 90 minute trip between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Bangladesh has lifted its coronavirus lockdown, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns despite the country registering a record spike in deaths and new infections. The country reported its biggest daily jump in infections on Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. Iran\u2019s coronavirus caseload has passed 150,000. Iran\u2019s ministry spokesman has announced 2,516 new cases were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 151,466, with warnings of a potential second wave caused by clusters in a number of provinces. The death toll has risen by 63 in the same time period, bringing the country\u2019s total toll to 7,797. Thailand\u2019s parliament has approved a record stimulus package of nearly $60 billion to revive its economy, which has been badly damaged by the coronavirus. The 1.9 trillion baht ($59.7 billion) package is the kingdom\u2019s biggest-ever cash injection, and is a sorely needed boost for Southeast Asia\u2019s second biggest economy which is expected to contract by 6-7% this year. UK records 113 deaths as it prepares to further ease lockdown. The Department of Health said 38,489 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, an increase of 113 from 38,376 the day before. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 115,725 tests were carried out or dispatched, with 1,936 positive results. The Italian \u2018orange vest\u2019 movement held several protests across the country on Saturday, demanding a new government and return to the Italian Lira while dismissing Covid-19 as a conspiracy. This included demonstrations in Milan and Bergamo, two cities in the epicentre of Italy\u2019s outbreak. Many of the protestors in Milan were not wearing masks and flouted distancing rules, triggering calls for them to be charged. France\u2019s coronavirus cases are continuing to decline, health officials have said, with 14,322 patients currently in hospital, down from 14,380 a day earlier. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care fell to 1,319 from 1,361, the health directorate said in a statement. The hospital death toll from the virus rose by 31 to 18,475, which represents the 11th consecutive daily increase below 100. Figures for nursing home deaths will next be updated on Tuesday.

Thanks in advance. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam\u2019s holiest site outside of Saudi Arabia, reopened on Sunday for prayers for the first time since it was closed in mid-March. With little regard for social distancing, throngs waited outside the holy site\u2019s gates before it opened early on Sunday, with many wearing surgical masks, the Associated Press reports. As they were allowed to enter, the faithful stopped to have their temperature measured. The mosque was one of Jerusalem\u2019s many holy sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Western Wall, whose access was restricted at the height of Israel\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Throughout that period, worshipers continued to pray in the alleyways outside the mosque.Jews also resumed their pilgrimages on Sunday to the hilltop compound they revere as the Temple Mount, site of the two Jewish biblical temples. Abu Dhabi announced on Sunday it will cordon off the UAE\u2019s capital as well as banning travel between regions within the emirate for a week from Tuesday to rein in coronavirus. It means that residents of the United Arab Emirates will not be allowed to travel from the capital Abu Dhabi to the services hub of Dubai, 90 minutes on a major highway, without a permit. The decision came as the authorities said they were easing other restrictions within Abu Dhabi, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, AFP reports. The authorities placed \u201ca ban on movement entering and exiting the emirate and between its regions\u201d from 2 June, according to the Abu Dhabi media office. It added that residents may move freely within their own regions between the hours of 6am and 10pm. But malls, restaurants, and hotel beaches will be allowed to reopen on Monday at 40% capacity, the media office said. It added that outdoor activities, such as horse riding, cricket, cycling, golfing and sailing were also now allowed. The UAE has so far recorded more than 34,000 cases of the Covid-19 respiratory disease, including 264 deaths. Earlier this week, Dubai emirate moved to lift restrictions on businesses and shortened a nighttime curfew. The Guardian report on the major global coronavirus developments on Sunday can be read here. Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections, AFP reports. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. The lifting comes as Bangladesh - which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund - reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. Restrictions to curb the virus imposed on March 26 have been gradually eased in recent weeks, with only educational institutions remaining closed. The country of 168 million has reported 47,151 infections and 650 deaths, although experts warn Bangladesh is not conducting enough testing and the actual toll is likely much higher, AFP reports. In the UK, the Department of Health said 38,489 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, up by 113 from 38,376 the day before. In the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 115,725 tests were carried out or dispatched with 1,936 positive results. Overall, a total of 4,285,738 tests have been carried out and 274,762 cases have been confirmed positive. Daily coronavirus testing capacity reached 200,000 on Saturday, including capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, meeting the target to reach the milestone by the end of May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Some of Italy\u2019s famous cultural sites are coming back to life after being closed for more than three months owing to the coronavirus pandemic, Angela Giuffrida in Rome writes. The Leaning Tower of Pisa reopened on Saturday while the Colosseum and Vatican Museums will welcome visitors again from Monday, and Florence\u2019s Uffizi gallery from Tuesday. A huge exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of the Renaissance painter Raphael will open at Le Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome on Monday. All sites and museums are reopening with strict safety measures in place. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, which usually attracts 5 million visitors a year, is only permitting 15 people in at a time. They have to wear face masks as well as an electronic device that warns them if they are less than a metre of anyone else. You can read more on this story here. Egyptian hotels operating with a new reduced occupancy rate of 25% to contain the spread of coronavirus have almost reached full capacity, a tourism ministry official told Reuters on Sunday. Egypt suspended international flights in March and shut down restaurants, hotels and cafes in order to combat the pandemic. Although airports remain closed to all but domestic and repatriation flights, hotels were recently allowed to reopen at a quarter of their usual capacity if they met strict health and safety protocols. Around 78 hotels, mostly along the Red Sea coast, met these rules and are currently operating with an occupancy rate of 20%-22%, said the ministry official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. An additional 173 hotels across the country have applied for a licence to reopen and will be considered in the coming week, he added. The government said it aimed to increase the permitted occupancy rate of hotels to 50% in June. Tourism is one of the country\u2019s main sources of foreign currency and accounts for 5% of GDP. Egypt has so far registered 23,449 cases of coronavirus including 913 deaths. Some of the first cases registered in the country were of foreign nationals. Iran said its caseload of coronavirus infections passed 150,000 on Sunday, as the country struggles to contain a recent upward trend. The government has largely lifted the restrictions it imposed in order to halt a COVID-19 outbreak that first emerged in mid-February. But the health ministry has warned of a potential virus resurgence with new cluster outbreaks in a number of provinces, AFP reports. Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2,516 new cases were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 151,466. Infections have been on a rising trajectory in the Islamic republic since hitting a near two-month low on May 2. Jahanpour said the virus had claimed another 63 lives over the same period, raising the overall toll to 7,797. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about Iran\u2019s official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher, AFP reports. Paris is gearing up for a battle for public space after the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said cafes, bars and restaurants would be temporarily allowed to set up tables on pavements and in parking spaces when they open this week, Kim Willsher in Paris reports. Coronavirus lockdown measures are being eased further on Tuesday, with food and drink establishment opening across most of France for the first time since 14 March. However, because Paris remains \u201corange\u201d on the country\u2019s Covid-19 map, meaning the virus is still circulating, bar, cafe and restaurant owners have been told they can only serve customers outside on terraces and with strict physical distancing and protection measures in place.

Thailand\u2019s parliament approved the 1.9 trillion baht ($59.7 billion) package - the kingdom\u2019s biggest-ever cash injection - on Sunday. It is a much-needed boost for Southeast Asia\u2019s second biggest economy, expected to contract by 6-7 percent in 2020, AFP reports About $17.3 billion of the package will be given as aid to farmers and informal workers such as street vendors and those employed in massage parlours and bars who have seen their work dry up. The stimulus will also provide for a fund to stabilise markets and boost purchasing power, as well as $1.4 billion for \u201chealthcare readiness\u201d, the government said, without providing further details on how the money would be spent. The ruling coalition - led by premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha\u2019s Phalang Pracharat party - holds a slim majority in the lower house, and members of the opposition largely abstained from voting. Opposition MPs criticised the lack of transparency in how the money will be allocated. The virus\u2019 toll has slowed in recent weeks in Thailand, which on Sunday saw four new cases - all imported from overseas. So far, the kingdom has reported just over 3,000 cases and 57 deaths. Its tourism-reliant economy has been severely affected by the halt in international travel. More than 20 million have already registered for a government cash handout of 5,000 baht (US$150). Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has just confirmed that his socialist-led coalition government will seek a sixth and final extension of the coronavirus state of emergency, which will run until 21 June. [See previous post at 10.37] . S\u00e1nchez said a last, two-week extension of the the emergency powers, in effect since 14 March, was needed and warned against complacency. Addressing a press conference on Sunday afternoon he said: We cannot forget the thousands of lives lost to Covid-19. I ask for prudence and respect for the health rules.\u201d He added: We need to go the final distance to end the health emergency. Today we need a final, definitive extension of the state of emergency, which will be lighter [than previous ones].\u201d S\u00e1nchez will need to seek congress\u2019s approval for the extension, but it is likely to pass with the help or abstention of small but key Catalan and Basque parties. The prime minister also said that the country\u2019s vital tourist industry needed to be \u201creactivated\u201d as soon as possible. The domestic market is set to reopen in the coming weeks and foreign tourists are due to return from the beginning of July. \u201cVisitors to Spain will find physical distancing, but emotional closeness,\u201d he added. The country\u2019s death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, reflecting a dramatic decline in daily fatalities as Spain brings the outbreak under control. To date, it has recorded 239,228 cases. A French care home has found an imaginative way of helping loved ones connect during the Covid-19 pandemic. You can watch the Reuters video here. Pope Francis is cautioning against pessimism as many people emerge from lockdowns to lament that nothing will ever be the same, AP reports. During Mass in St. Peters Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say nothing will return as before. That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that the one thing that certainly does not return is hope. He took to task his own church for its fragmentation, saying it must pull together. The world sees conservatives and progressives but instead all are children of God,\u201d he said, telling the faithful to focus on what unites them. In this pandemic, how wrong narcissism is, Francis said, lamenting the tendency to think only of our needs, to be indifferent to those of others, and to not admit our own frailties and mistakes. At this moment, in the great effort of beginning anew, how damaging is pessimism, the tendency to see everything in the worst light and to keep saying that nothing will return as before! the pope said. When someone thinks this way, the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.\u2019\u2019 A few dozen faithful, wearing masks and sitting one to a pew, attended the ceremony as part of safety measures to avoid spreading COVID-19. While the Vatican has re-opened the basilica to tourists, the rank-and-file faithful still aren\u2019t allowed yet to attend Masses celebrated by the pope for fear of crowding. A German engineer on the first flight carrying European workers back to China has tested positive for coronavirus as an asymptomatic carrier, local authorities said Sunday. The man was on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to the northeastern city of Tianjin which landed with around 200 passengers, mainly German workers and their families, AFP reports. Tianjin authorities said in a statement on social media Sunday that the 34-year-old engineer had tested positive, although he had a regular temperature and reported no symptoms. He has since been transferred to a local hospital for observation. All passengers were tested for coronavirus after landing and have to quarantine for two weeks. The engineer was one of three new asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus reported on Sunday, with the other two being domestic cases. The country has not reported new fatalities in recent weeks, with its death toll remaining at 4,634. China has set up fast-track entry procedures with several countries, including Singapore and South Korea, since drastically cutting international flights in late March and imposing an entry ban on most foreigners. The Lufthansa flight landing on Saturday is expected to be followed by a second charter departing Frankfurt for Shanghai this Wednesday. There are more than 5,000 German companies operating in China, according to the local German Chamber of Commerce. Apart from the German flight, Beijing has announced that some Singapore nationals will be allowed to return from early June. The Italian \u2018orange vest\u2019 movement held several protests across Italy on Saturday, including in Milan and Bergamo, two cities in the epicentre of Italy\u2019s coronavirus pandemic, demanding a new government and return to the Italian Lira while dismissing Covid-19 as a conspiracy. Hundreds of people gathered at Milan\u2019s Piazza del Duomo, many without wearing masks and flouting physical distancing rules, triggering anger and calls for them to be charged. Protesters claimed Covid-19 is a \u201cpolitical design by the government because they want to sell us to China\u201d, according to Italian media reports. Beppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, said he has asked the chief of police to charge the organisers for an event that was \u201can act of irresponsibility in a city like Milan that is trying so hard to get out of a difficult situation\u201d. Dozens of others who protested in Bergamo, the Italian city hardest by coronavirus, were also condemned by the mayor, Giorgio Gori, who described them as \u201cirresponsible deniers\u201d. Similar protests were held in Turin, Bologna and Florence. Italy\u2019s \u2018orange vest\u2019 movement was founded last year by Antonio Pappalardo, an ex police general, and models itself on France\u2019s \u2018yellow vests\u2019. Another demonstration attended by a significant number of people from extreme right groups was held in Rome, with many participants reportedly dismissing Covid-19 as \u201ca trick\u201d. Hi. This is Caroline Davies. I am taking over the blog now and you can contact me on caroline.davies@theguardian.com \u2022 The world has passed the milestone of six million confirmed coronavirus cases, with 6,048,384 confirmed infections worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities. \u2022 In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June. He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. \u2022 British ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. \u2022 Spain\u2019s prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements, newspaper El Pais reported. Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders that this would be the last lockdown as infection rates have reduced dramatically in one of the European countries worst hit by the pandemic. \u2022 Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. \u2022 South Korea has reported 27 new cases of coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. \u2022 Two of Islam\u2019s holiest sites have reopened as large numbers of mosques across Saudi Arabia also opened their doors for the first time in more than two months. Worshipers have been ordered to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as Islam\u2019s holiest site in Mecca remained closed to the public. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims after Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mecca and Medina, also reopened for prayers. A record number of Americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families. Nationwide, the demand for aid at food banks and pantries has soared since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, according to the latest figures. As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year \u2013 a 63% increase compared to 2018. Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an analysis by Feeding America, the national food bank network. Donald Trump has been forced to cancel a planned face to face Summit of leaders of the G7 nations in June and now wants to host an expanded meeting in September dedicated to combating China to which Vladimir Putin would be invited. Trump revealed on Saturday he had cancelled the June G7 meeting after Angela Merkel the German chancellor told him in a phone call that she saw the summit in Washington as a health risk. Normally hundreds of journalists and officials attend the two day summits, as well as security staff. He had billed the face to face summit as a symbol of America \u201ctransitioning back to greatness\u201d. Reports suggest the call between Merkel and Trump on Thursday was stormy ranging over German plans for Nord Stream gas pipeline, Hong Kong and the medical risks in holding a face to face G7. Trump\u2019s new plan, outlined to reporters on Saturday, is to host an expanded meeting G7 including Russia, Australia, Korea and India dedicated to building an alliance against China. The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong. Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy. The Republicans see a tough approach to China as an election winning formula, even though his likely Democrat challenger Joe Biden is also sharply critical of the modern direction of China. Spain\u2019s prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements, El Pais reported. Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders during a video-conference meeting on Sunday that this would be the last lockdown as Spain\u2019s infection rates have reduced dramatically. The country\u2019s death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, reflecting a dramatic decline in daily fatalities as Spain brings the outbreak under control. Here\u2019s footage, tweeted by prime minster\u2019s official residence, of that meeting earlier: Canada is to invest 30 million Canadian dollars (US $21.8 million) to enable its provinces and territories to promote holidays in their \u201cown back yard\u201d because of the closure of the country\u2019s borders due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Destination Canada, the country\u2019s national marketing body which usually focuses on luring international visitors, is due to announce the new funding later on Sunday, according to a statement seen by Reuters before its official release. Canada, which has had more than 7,000 deaths due to COVID-19, has closed its borders to non-essential travel since March, and it is unclear when they will be opened again. Many provinces have also shut down domestic non-essential travel. Quebec, which shares borders with the U.S. states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, accounts for more than 60% of the Canadian death toll from the virus, and Ontario, the most populous province, has also been hit hard. The Afghan health ministry has warned that a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d is spreading across the war-torn country as number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed 15,000, amid continued surge of transmission in Kabul. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister warned on Sunday that the virus was spreading as lockdown rules continued to be flouted. Meanwhile, the health ministry recorded 680 new cases and eight deaths of Covid-19 as more than of half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive across the country. It takes the total number of infections to 15,205 and death toll to 257. There have been 1,328 recoveries. Most of new cases recorded in the capital city of Kabul 371 patients tested positive, Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area in number of transmissions with 6,146 confirmed cases and 30 deaths. The Irish government is considering moves to speed up plans to ease the national lockdown, including brining forward plans to scrap limits on how far the public can travel from home. Museums, galleries, hairdressers and other amenities could also reopen by the end of June, while hotels could be allowed to operate with limited occupancies subject to the spread of Covid-19 remaining suppressed, the Sunday Independent reports. The newspaper reports that the current 5km limit on travel is expected to be replaced by a new 20km limit from Monday week, but the Irish government is now also considering if this could be allowed to expire from June 29, three weeks earlier than had been planned. Hong Kong\u2019s 17-day run without a local coronavirus infection ended on Sunday as a woman with no recent travel history tested positive, the South China Morning Post reports, citing sources. Her husband also tested \u201cpreliminary\u201d positive, it adds. The city\u2019s total of confirmed cases now stands at 1,083. Parties and larger social gatherings have been blamed in Spain for spikes in infection that have caused regional problems for that country\u2019s ongoing attempts to return to some level of normality, El Pais reports. In the western city of Badajoz, infections that are believed to have been picked up at a birthday party led to 18 people having to self-isolate, while there have been other small cases of inter-familiar infections at other social gatherings. \u201cAn innocent party can end up with an outbreak,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Coordination Center for Health Alerts. \u201cBut some of the cases were not so innocent, and occurred after clear violations of the deescalation rules. This is why the Spanish authorities have been constantly calling on citizens not to drop their guard and to stick closely to the regulations of each phase. \u201cIf we are not all already in the new normality it\u2019s for a reason.\u201d Fears that the easing of the lockdown in England could lead to a rise in infections after community transmission had been suppressed in recent weeks, have been expressed by a leading public health expert interviewed this morning on Sky news. Police across swathes of Africa have failed to find more than a fraction of hundreds of people who have escaped from often unsanitary and uncomfortable Covid-19 quarantine centres in recent weeks. There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, but low levels of testing means the true total is likely to be much higher, reports the Guardian\u2019s Africa Correspondent Jason Burke and Nyasha Chingono in Harare. In Malawi, more than 400 people repatriated from South Africa and elsewhere fled a makeshift centre set up at a stadium in Blantyre, the commercial capital, last week. Police and health workers told reporters they were unable to stop the escapees as they lacked adequate protective gear. At least 46 escapees had tested positive for the virus, officials said. Some of those who fled told reporters they had bribed police. In separate incidents 26 people left the Mwanza border post while waiting for test results and eight others, all tested and shown to be infected, broke out of an isolation centre in Blantyre. In Zimbabwe, Paul Nyathi, a police spokesman, said a total of 148 people had escaped from centres where a 21-day quarantine is mandatory for those returning from abroad. Government ministers in Britain have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. They said that they were given details of their roles just four working days before Matt Hancock, Britain\u2019s health minister, launched test and trace last week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a \u201cworld-beating\u201d operation would be in place by June. However, those involved in ongoing attempts to set up a system to target local outbreaks told the Observer that launching too soon risked giving the wrong message to the public. They said a comprehensive system was weeks away. \u201cDoing it all too early risks giving people a false sense of security,\u201d said one senior local government figure. Russia has reported 9,268 new cases of the novel coronavirus, raising the national tally to 405,843. Officials said 138 people had died of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, in the last 24 hours, pushing to nationwide toll up to 4,693. Amid unease and outright criticism from some scientific advisors to the British government about moves to ease the lockdown in England, the First Minister of Scotland\u2019s devolved government has been emphasising the reasons for the more cautious approach being taken by her administration. Nicola Sturgeon, who attends meetings of a UK-wide committee of experts and political leaders convened by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the believed there was a concern on the part of some scientists that politicians had been seeking to blame them for mistakes that have been made in recent months. On Thursday and Friday, UK government advisers voiced unease over the decision to lift England\u2019s lockdown while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with the coronavirus, warning that loosening restrictions could easily lead to a second wave. Sturgeon went on to suggest that there was a question of \u201cunderreporting\u201d of deaths in England when it came to care homes. Over recent months, care homes across the UK have been devastated by Covid-19. Forty per cent of homes have been hit in England, more in Scotland, and at least a dozen care workers are dead. Large number of mosques across Saudi Arabia have reopened for the first time in more than two months, but worshipers have been ordered to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as Islam\u2019s holiest site in Mecca remained closed to the public. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims after Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mecca and Medina, also reopened for prayers for the first time since it was closed since mid-March. Throngs waited outside the holy site\u2019s gates before it opened early on Sunday, with many wearing surgical masks, the Associated Press reports. As they were allowed to enter, the faithful stopped to have their temperature measured. The mosque was one of Jerusalems many holy sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, that were restricted to worshipers at the height of Israels coronavirus outbreak. Throughout that period, worshipers continued to pray in the alleyways outside the mosque. Rwanda\u2019s ministry of health on Sunday reported the East African nation\u2019s first death caused by the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. The victim was a 65-year-old driver who opted to return home from a neighbouring country, where he resided, after falling severely ill, the ministry said in a statement. He passed away from severe respiratory complications while receiving treatment at a specialised COVID-19 treatment facility. (Reporting by Clement Uwiringiyimana Writing by Duncan The British government is coming under fresh pressure to drop plans which could see all primary schools in England returning to normal before the summer holidays. Ministers have said that five tests set for itself by the government before the easing of the lockdown have been met - and schools will admit more pupils in selected classes from Monday. However, unions have called for the government to \u201cdraw back\u201d on the Monday opening, and National Governance Association, which brings together school governors, has expressed concern about a return to normal before summer. The body\u2019s chief executive Emma Knights has written to Britain\u2019s Education minister, Gavin Williamson, asking him to \u201creview and drop\u201d this expectation, according to the BBC. The leader of the opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, said this will be a \u201ccritical week\u201d for the country as lockdown measures are relaxed. He also claimed government action over the past 10 days had made difficult decisions more \u201crisky\u201d This is Ben Quinn picking up the global blog now. You can reach me at @BenQuinn75 That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Many thanks to those of you who got in touch on Twitter and via email. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Global cases pass six million. The world has passed the milestone of six million confirmed coronavirus cases, with 6,048,384 confirmed infections worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities. Donald Trump postpones G7 summit and signals wider attendance list. In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June. He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week. Pressure builds on South African president. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa faces a fresh leadership test over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation prepares to reopen its economy on Monday. South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. Brazil cases near 500,000. Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d. South Korea reports 27 new cases. South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms. The more than 2 million vulnerable people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England will be allowed to go outdoors from Monday. Greece to test visitors based on the airport they left from. Greece will conduct coronavirus tests on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency EASA when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. The list currently includes 13 airports in the United Kingdom, all those in 22 US states and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris. Government regulations come into force tomorrow that will allow groups of up to six people to meet up outside, including in back gardens. After 10 long and monotonous weeks of social isolation, it\u2019s the news that, if not everybody, then certainly sausage manufacturers have been dreaming of. \u201cYou can even have a barbecue,\u201d announced prime minister Boris Johnson last week in one of those Churchillian moments of national spirit-raising for which he would like to be renowned. That is to say, you can chuck lighter fuel on the charcoal as long as your gathering is socially distanced, everyone washes their hands and exercises what Johnson called \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2013 a disputed concept, these days; it may mean that if you don\u2019t possess a barbecue set yourself, then you can drive 260 miles to see a family member who does have one. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. \u201cThe Trump presidency is over,\u201d writes Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, and a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley. By having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America, Trump has abdicated his office. He is not governing. He\u2019s golfing, watching cable TV and tweeting. How has Trump responded to the widespread unrest following the murder in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for minutes as he was handcuffed on the ground? Trump called the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened to have them shot. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d he tweeted, parroting a former Miami police chief whose words spurred race riots in the late 1960s. On Saturday, he gloated about \u201cthe most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons\u201d awaiting protesters outside the White House, should they ever break through Secret Service lines. Trump\u2019s response to the last three ghastly months of mounting disease and death has been just as heedless. Since claiming Covid-19 was a \u201cDemocratic hoax\u201d and muzzling public health officials, he has punted management of the coronavirus to the states. The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of US cities hit by massive protests after the police killing of George Floyd, has a message for demonstrators: If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a Covid test this week, AP reports. As emergency orders are lifted and beaches and businesses reopen, add protests to the list of concerns about a possible second wave of coronavirus outbreaks. It\u2019s also an issue from Paris to Hong Kong, where anti-government protesters accuse police of using social distancing rules to break up their rallies. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering, many without masks. \u201cWhether they\u2019re fired up or not that doesn\u2019t prevent them from getting the virus,\u201d said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. One protester said she has no choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,\u201d Spence Ingram, a black woman, said after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta on Friday. \u201cBut I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.\u201d Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, in her warning Saturday evening, said there is still a pandemic in America thats killing black and brown people at higher numbers. The protests started in Minneapolis following the death there of George Floyd last Monday after a white officer pressed a knee into the black mans neck. The Observer view on the premature relaxation of the lockdown: Throughout this pandemic, Boris Johnson has claimed to have been \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. By parroting this epistemological nonsense, ministers are encouraging us to believe that they are only doing what the scientists tell them. It is but a short step from there to blaming the government\u2019s scientific advisers for the UK\u2019s terrible death toll. This lends added significance to the roll call of prominent scientists \u2013 including some senior members of the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee for emergencies (Sage) \u2013 who have this weekend publicly made clear their concerns that the government is relaxing the lockdown in England too early. The number of people infected by the coronavirus around the world has passed 6 million, as the pandemic forced Donald trump to postpone the G7 summit in Washington. More than 1.7 million of those cases have been registered in the United States, and its continued spread in the world\u2019s richest nation has forced the US president to abandon plans to stage a G7 summit as his hoped-for sign of America\u2019s recovery. Brazil has surpassed France\u2019s death toll after it reached 28,834 coronavirus fatalities, becoming the country with the world\u2019s fourth-highest death toll. The country has almost 500,000 cases, second behind the US. Serious concerns are emerging over the treatment of children in custody during the coronavirus pandemic, after evidence that some have been spending as little as 40 minutes a day out of their cell. A series of \u201cserious consequences for children\u2019s rights, wellbeing and long-term outcomes\u201d has been identified in an investigation by the office of the children\u2019s commissioner for England. This comes with ministers warning that there is now an increased risk of self-harm and violence in adult prisons as a result of measures introduced to tackle Covid-19. Children in custody have been subject to restricted activities for the past eight weeks, as institutions attempt to comply with official social-distancing guidance. Face-to-face education sessions have stopped in most centres, and visits have been hugely reduced. \u201cAccess to time out of cell, education, activities and family and professional visits have been severely curtailed,\u201d the investigation finds. Meet the robots helping to tackle coronavirus Automatons have been chipping in with the effort to beat Covid, from disinfecting hospitals to delivering groceries. The UN has equipped Rwanda with five anti-epidemic robots made by Belgian company Zora Bots to help against the country\u2019s battle with coronavirus. The robots can screen a patient\u2019s temperature, identify people not wearing masks and monitor abnormalities in how patients sound or look. They can also be used to deliver medicine and other essentials to the infected: Thailand reported four new coronavirus cases on Sunday and no new deaths, taking the total number of infections to 3,081 with 57 deaths since January. The new patients had arrived in Thailand from the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia and have been in state quarantine, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Local infections have slowed and over the last two weeks, around 80% of new cases were Thais who had returned from abroad, Panprapa added. Thailand will on Monday begin reopening more businesses classified as medium to high risks, including cinemas and gyms. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa faces a fresh leadership test over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation is preparing to reopen its economy on Monday as it moves into level three of a five-tier lockdown, in force since 27 March, sowing bitter divisions. South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March. The rand meanwhile has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Unemployment and poverty are very high. Under level three, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen, as will schools and places of worship. Liquor sales will resume, but for home consumption only. Global cases pass 6 million. The world has passed the milestone of six million confirmed coronavirus cases, with 6,057,553 confirmed infections worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and 369,106 deaths. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities. Donald Trump postpones G7 summit. US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June and will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Trump said. Lockdown to be eased for England\u2019s most clinically vulnerable. The more than 2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors from Monday for the first time in 10 weeks.Boris Johnson praised their resilience as their particular lockdown measures are set to be eased. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, will confirm the move on Sunday. Brazil cases near 500,000 after record increase. Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.

South Africa\u2019s infection cases now exceed 30,000, the country\u2019s health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. The death toll increased by 32 to 643. Thailand\u2019s parliament is due Sunday to vote on whether to approve a near-US$60 billion stimulus to revive an economy battered by the pandemic. If agreed, it will be the biggest state cash injection in Thai history. Thailand has long paraded low unemployment as a symbol of its economic success. But millions rely on informal work or day wages for survival, jobs imperilled by a feared 6-7% contraction in the economy. South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers, AP reports. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea was reporting about 500 new cases per day in early March but had seemed to stabilize its outbreak with aggressive tracking and tracing, which allowed authorities to ease social distancing guidelines. But cases in the greater capital area have been rising steadily again since May amid increased public activity, causing alarm as millions of children have begun returning to schools. On Saturday, KCDC senior official Kwon Jun-wook said at least 108 infections were linked to workers or visitors at a warehouse of local e-commerce giant Coupang, which has seen orders spike amid the epidemic. Around 270 other infections have been linked to nightclubs and other entertainment venues, which saw huge crowds in early May amid the relaxed atmosphere on social distancing. India is extending its ongoing lockdown in designated coronavirus containment zones until 30 June but will allow all economic activities to restart in a phased manner outside those areas as cases continue to rise in its major cities. India\u2019s Home Ministry said in a directive issued Saturday that a reopening phase set to start Monday is called Unlock 1. The directive said religious sites and places of worship, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services and shopping malls will be allowed to reopen outside all containment zones starting 8 June. Subways, schools and colleges will remain shuttered nationwide and only be allowed to reopen after further assessment of the situation in July, according to the directive. India started easing lockdown restrictions earlier this month, allowing shops to reopen, manufacturing to resume, some trains and domestic flights to operate. The country, which has a population of 1.3 billion, has reported 173,763 confirmed virus cases, including more than 4,970 deaths. New Zealand has no new cases of coronavirus for the ninth day in a row, Stuff.nz reports. As at 9am on Sunday, 1504 cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed in the country, 1154 of which were confirmed by tests. The other 350 were \u201cprobable\u201d cases of the illness. Just one person \u2013 who is in their 50s and linked to the St Margaret\u2019s Hospital and Rest Home cluster in Auckland \u2013 is believed to have an \u201cactive\u201d case of the illness. That person is not in hospital. The latest data indicated New Zealand was on track to becoming one of the first countries in the world to eliminate all active Covid-19 cases. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 286 to 181,482, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 11 to 8,500, the data showed. Brazil has surpassed France\u2019s death toll, after it reached 28,834 coronavirus fatalities, becoming the country with the world\u2019s fourth-highest death toll. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro remain the hardest-hit states in Brazil in terms of sheer numbers, while per capita rates are higher in the country\u2019s impoverished north and northeast, where health facilities are reaching capacity. Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Health has indicated \u201cthere is no way to foresee\u201d when the country\u2019s outbreak will peak, and experts say the number of cases could be 15 times higher than the confirmed figure because there has been no widespread testing. The pandemic is spreading across Brazil under a cloud of confrontation, as governors and mayors implement restrictive measures while President Jair Bolsonaro, who has pinned his hopes of re-election on a booming economy, has berated them for imposing what he calls \u201cthe tyranny of total quarantine.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic has seen a ferocious competition erupt between China and the US, the UN\u2019s two main contributors, fuelling paralysis according to diplomats, AFP reports. After more than two months of negotiations, the 15 Security Council members were unable to reach agreement on a resolution supporting a call from the UN secretary-general for a global cease-fire while the world battles the novel coronavirus. The reason? US-Chinese differences over a passing mention in the draft resolution to the World Health Organization (WHO), with which President Donald Trump on Friday said he planned to sever ties. Both UN officials and diplomats say the US-Chinese conflict seems to be spreading, leaving them increasingly pessimistic. \u201cThe Security Council has been frozen for 45 years between 1945 and 1990, because of the Cold War,\u201d one ambassador said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe last thing we need is another Cold War that would freeze again the Security Council.\u201d \u201cImporting bilateral disputes in the Council would be a disaster,\u201d he said. Added another ambassador: \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t enter in a new Cold War. But it doesn\u2019t look very good at the moment,\u201d whether regarding leadership, the pandemic or US-Chinese relations, three subjects \u201cvery closely tied to each other.\u201d Onto Australia\u2019s economy now. Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says even if this week\u2019s economic growth numbers prove to be positive, there is little doubt Australia is in a recession that has ended 29 consecutive years of expansion, AAP reports. The national accounts for the March quarter are released on Wednesday, which will take into account the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Economists\u2019 forecasts centre on a 0.3% economic contraction in the quarter, which will drag annual growth down to just 1.4%. The annual growth rate at 2.2% as of the December quarter was already well below its long-running average of 2.8%. Forecasts range for a decline of a much as 0.7% in the quarter. \u201cEven if the March quarter was not negative, the idea that we\u2019re not in a recession right now is fanciful,\u201d Dr Chalmers told Sky News\u2019 Sunday Agenda program. \u201cMost economists, the government, the Reserve Bank, and certainly Labor expect that the June quarter will be much worse than the March quarter.\u201d Hammered by the health crisis, China\u2019s economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began. Analysts believe it will be months before broader activity returns to pre-crisis levels, even if a fresh wave of infections can be avoided, Reuters reports. While most businesses have reopened, many manufacturers are struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders as lockdowns push the global economy into recession. Domestic demand also remains depressed amid increased job losses and worries about a second wave of infections. Factories reduced headcount for the first time since they reopened, with a sub-index falling to 49.4 from 50.2 in April, the survey showed. Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government\u2019s work report earlier this month did not set an annual growth goal, marking the first time China has not set a target since 2002. Beijing also announced additional fiscal measures to bolster the economy, equal to about 4.1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), according to Reuters calculations, its largest stimulus package since the global financial crisis. China recorded two new confirmed cases of coronavirus on 30 May, down from four the day before, data from the country\u2019s health authority showed on Sunday. Both cases were imported in the Chinese province of Shandong, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement on its website. The NHC also confirmed three new asymptomatic cases, compared to four the day before. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained at 4,634. The total number of confirmed cases in the mainland as of May 30 stood at 83,001, data form NHC showed. Mexico on Saturday registered 2,885 new cases of coronavirus and 364 more deaths, bringing the total numbers to 87,512 cases and 9,779 fatalities, according to data from health authorities. Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa mosque reopened to worshippers on Sunday after a two-and-a-half month coronavirus closure, but Muslim authorities imposed some precautions as health officials warn of an uptick in local infections. The resumption of prayers at Islam\u2019s third-holiest site caps a sombre period for Jerusalem\u2019s Muslims, who this year marked the holy fasting month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday without their usual daily visits to Al-Aqsa and the adjoining Dome of the Rock. The Council of Islamic Waqf cited the slowed local spread of Covid-19 in lifting entry restrictions and reopening the compound\u2019s iconic shrines, which shut on 15 March. Worshippers must wear face masks and bring personal prayer rugs should they wish to pray inside the shrines or on the compound\u2019s outdoor grounds, the council said in a statement. Around 700 worshippers were present on the compound for dawn prayers on Sunday, the vast majority of whom wore face masks and brought prayer rugs. Muslims believe the site to be where the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven. Jews revere it as the site of the Jewish temples of antiquity. There have been 17,000 coronavirus cases and 284 deaths in Israel, and 386 cases and three deaths in the occupied West Bank. Activity in China\u2019s services sector expanded at a faster clip in May as measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak were lifted, official data showed on Sunday, suggesting business and consumer confidence may slowly be improving, Reuters reports. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 53.6 in May, from 53.2 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. China\u2019s services sector, which includes many smaller, private companies, has not recovered from the health crisis as quickly as manufacturing, with heavy job losses, pay cuts and fears of a second wave of infections making consumers cautious about spending again. The official May composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained flat at 53.4 from April. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. In the US, Los Angeles, which has shut down its Covid-19 testing centres in response to escalating protests, remains the primary hotspot for coronavirus cases in California, and the county announced 2,112 new cases and 48 deaths on Saturday. The Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales, meanwhile, have recorded six and three new cases of Covid-19 respectively. In NSW, all three cases are recently returned travellers who are currently in mandatory hotel quarantine. In Victoria, the health minister Jenny Mikakos has just given an update to media on the six new cases. She said two of the cases are linked to a family outbreak in the Keilor Downs area of the state. There has also been another case recorded flowing from an outbreak linked to a Rydges Hotel in Melbourne which has been hosting returned travellers in mandatory quarantine. A security guard at the hotel has tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of cases from that cluster to seven. Mikakos also said that two schools which were closed because of positive cases last week - Keilor Secondary College and Holy Eucharist Primary School - are due to reopen tomorrow. In Australia, the Queensland state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has just announced the state will bring forward the easing of Covid-19 restrictions within the state, allowing gatherings of up to 20 people and travel within the state. Speaking just now Palaszczuk said that from 1 June (so, tomorrow) restrictions banning recreational travel within Queensland will be lifted. Or, as she described it, \u201copening up Queensland for Queenslanders\u201d. She also said that from tomorrow cafes, restaurants and bars in Queensland will be able to hold 20 people. The state had intended to lift those restrictions on 12 June, but Palaszczuk said the state had decided to lift the ban on travel within the state earlier than expected because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d work controlling the spread of the virus. However, the state\u2019s hard border closure to New South Wales, which is currently subject to a High Court challenge from mining magnate Clive Palmer, will remain in place. Queensland recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. There are currently five active cases in the state. In the US, KTLA news is reporting that coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed as a result of the protests. KTLA reports: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that all COVID-19 testing centers in the city closed Saturday afternoon due to safety concerns as protests against the killing of George Floyd continued throughout the city. \u201cWe need to make sure, especially in communities that have less power, that we are able to make sure people don\u2019t disproportionately die because of the color of their skin,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that when the city breaks down.\u201d All of the testing sites closed as of 3 p.m. the mayor said \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the other testing sites outside the city within broader L.A. County were affected. Below is a roundup of the latest on the protests in the US. A reminder that we have ongoing live coverage of the unrest here. US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June and will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Trump said. US awol from world stage as China tries on global leadership for sizeRead more The decision was a dramatic pivot for Trump, who had sought to host the group of major industrialised countries in Washington as a demonstration that the US was returning to normal after the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 103,000 Americans to date. In Australia, the New South Wales state government will walk away from its planned AU$810m (US$540m) redevelopment of the former Olympic stadium in Sydney as the state grapples with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, will announce that the state government will dump the stadium redevelopment, a key but controversial plank of its election pitch last year, instead announcing a AU$3bn fund for smaller, \u201cshovel-ready projects\u201d. The announcement will come a day before NSW seeks to boost its flailing economy by further loosening the lockdown restrictions introduced at the height of the pandemic, including increasing the number of patrons allowed at venues from 10 to 50 and allowing regional travel for the first time since March. In a statement issued to media before a formal announcement, Berejiklian said the decision to dump the stadium redevelopment was part of a wider plan to increase the state\u2019s infrastructure spend to about $100bn. The more than 2 million people who have been \u201cshielding\u201d from Covid-19 in England because they are deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable will be allowed to spend time outdoors from Monday for the first time in 10 weeks. Boris Johnson praised their resilience as their particular lockdown measures are set to be eased. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, will confirm the move on Sunday. In case you missed this earlier, in Australia, residents in the country\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, are enduring one more day of tight Covid restrictions before pubs, beauty salons and museums reopen and intrastate holiday travel is permitted, AAP reports. For the first time in almost three weeks, zero Covid-19 cases were reported in NSW on Saturday, from 9500 tests. A marketing campaign spruiking NSW as a tourist destination will target NSW, Victorian and ACT residents as coronavirus-related travel restrictions ease. The state government on Sunday said a major tourism marketing push would coincide with the restriction changes. Travellers from interstate will also be able to visit NSW under the changes, but must comply with the rules of their home state when returning. The next phase of the \u201cnow\u2019s the time to love NSW\u201d campaign \u2013 first announced earlier this year after bushfires devastated the state \u2013 will include a new television commercial and social media video series, and international digital advertising to keep the state in overseas visitors\u2019 minds. \u201cInterest in NSW road trips has jumped with a 125% increase in page views on VisitNSW.com in the past week,\u201d Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres said in a statement on Sunday. There are signs that thousands of Australians used the coronavirus shutdown to give up smoking, AAP reports. Federal health Minister Greg Hunt says between January and May this year, the My Quitbuddy app was downloaded more than 24,000 times, a staggering 310% increase over the same time last year. \u201cThese figures are very encouraging and I congratulate those who have taken the first step,\u201d Mr Hunt said in a statement on Sunday, coinciding with World No Tobacco Day. \u201cQuitting is not always easy, but assistance is available and the benefits are significant.\u201d He said there was growing evidence that smokers were more likely to develop a severe case of Covid-19 if they contracted the virus. The Australian government aims to reduce smoking to less than 10 per cent by 2025 through its 10-year National Preventive Health Strategy and has committed $31.6 million over four years from 2019/20 to reduce smoking prevalence. This includes $20 million over three years to develop a new National Tobacco Campaign to encourage smokers to quit. Brazil has nearly 500,000 cases, after a record one-day increase. Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. The world has passed the milestone of six million confirmed coronavirus cases, with 6,048,384 confirmed infections worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities. The ten worst-affected countries in terms of cases are: US: 1,769,776 Brazil: 498,440 Russia: 396,575 United Kingdom: 274,219 Spain: 239,228 Italy: 232,664 France: 188,752 Germany: 183,189 India: 181,827 Turkey: 163,103 Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, bringing you the latest global news for the next few hours. Please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world are all welcome. Global cases have passed 6 million, with 6,048,384 confirmed infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government data. The true number of infections and deaths, which currently stand at 368,711, are likely to be higher, as a result of delays, differing testing rates and definitions, and suspected underreporting. The sombre milestone comes as Brazil, the second-worst affected country in the world after the US, is nearing 500,000 cases, after it registered a record 33,274 new infections on Saturday. The current total at confirmed cases stands at 498,440. The death toll is 28,834. Global cases passed 6 million.

The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said. Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms. Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban paid a 3,000 lei fine ($690) for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks.Russia to start vaccine trial within two weeks Russian scientists plan to start clinical coronavirus vaccine trials within two weeks, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Avifavir. Greece will conduct coronavirus tests on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency EASA when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. The list currently includes 13 airports in the United Kingdom, all those in 22 US states and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris. Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals are planning a national march to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world. South Africa\u2019s infection cases now exceed 30,000, the country\u2019s health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. The death toll increased by 32 to 643. Pakistan has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days, and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days. Colombia is to lift quarantine measures in parts of the country, but issued new measures to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital Bogota. The country has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths. New York state governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill granting death benefits to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation.",
