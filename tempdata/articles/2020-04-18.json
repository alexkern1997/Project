This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. </p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

      "bodyText": "During the White House coronavirus briefing, Dr Brett Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health, said the US will need to conduct at least 4.5m tests a month before its safe to move into Phase 1 of the administration\u2019s Opening Up America Again plan. The president was less measured in his assessment, insisting that many states were ready to reopen, despite a lack of testing and evidence that the number of cases are decreasing. South Dakota governor Kristi Noem announced Friday that her state would begin a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to fight the coronavirus. \u201cSouth Dakota is now the first state in America to launch a statewide, state-backed clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to fight Covid-19,\u201d Noem said in remarks sent out by her office. Washington governor Jay Inslee said Trump was \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d with his tweets about liberating states under stay-at-home orders. Trump\u2019s tweets echoed messaging from right-wing protesters who have demonstrated against the orders, and they raised concerns that the president\u2019s supporters would feel encouraged to ignore social distancing guidelines. Andrew Cuomo criticized Trump after the president lashed out against the New York governor in a tweet. In response to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Cuomo should \u201cspend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining\u2019,\u201d the governor said, \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d California is nearing 1,000 coronavirus deaths. Governor Gavin Newsom said California recorded 95 deaths yesterday, making it the deadliest day so far and bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 985. Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to \u201crewrite history\u201d on how he first responded to coronavirus. \u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left American exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic,\u201d Biden said in a new video. \u201cHe ignored the warnings of health experts and the intelligence agencies and put his trust in China\u2019s leaders instead.\u201d The US daily coronavirus death toll hit a new record yesterday. According to the Wall Street Journal, 4,591 Americans died over 24 hours, nearly doubling the record of 2,569 that was set on Wednesday. The country\u2019s total death currently stands at 34,614. Has the coronavirus pandemic \u201cpeaked\u201d in the US? A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\u201d The press briefing has ended. We\u2019ll have more analysis from the Guardian\u2019s David Smith coming soon \u2014 stay tuned. I didn\u2019t quite notice this exact phrasing when Trump was discussing rallies... Note: this tweet was later deleted by the user. The president skirted questions about how the businesses could reopen without schools reopening as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question, I think the schools are going to be open soon,\u201d he said. The White House\u2019s own plan to \u201cOpen Up America Again\u201d suggests that schools and organized youth activities \u201cthat are currently closed should remain closed\u201d during Phase 1. \u201cI hope we\u2019re gonna have rallies. I think they\u2019ll be bigger than ever,\u201d Trump said. When the rallies have to be spaced out, with attendees spaced out, \u201cit loses a lot of flavor,\u201d Trump noted. On the protestors who gathered around the country and flouted distancing measures, Trump said, \u201cThey seem to be very responsible people to me.\u201d Here\u2019s more background on those protests: Asked to address his \u201cLIBERATE\u201d tweets, Trump said he is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with what he posted. He noted that some states are going too far with social distancing measures. \u201cI think some things are too tough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, that it\u2019s too tough.\u201d But states are currently following federal guidelines encouraging Americans to stay home. In order to enter Phase 1 of the plan to reopen the country, the US needs to be doing about 4.5m tests per month, Giroir said. By the end of April, the US will have access to 5m more swabs, which will help speed up those efforts, he noted. The public health officials on the task force have outlined the different types of tests available, including antibody or serology tests that check for immunity and RNA tests that check for the presence of the virus. Yesterday, to speed up testing and address supply shortages, the FDA announced that it would allow a broader range of swabs to be used for tests, including some that would be easier to manufacture. But the messaging from Dr Birx, Dr Fauci, and Dr Brett Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health, is that there will be enough testing, soon. Trump, meanwhile, has been insisting that the testing capacity is already where it needs to be. \u201cIf about 1 out of 10 people are positive,\u201d Giroir said, then health officials know that they are testing enough people. \u201cWe\u2019re working with states to unlock the full potential\u201d for them to conduct up to a million tests a month, Dr Deborah Birx said. Experts are advising laboratories and assessing what their needs and shortages are. Dr Anthony Fauci made the point that it\u2019s a \u201creasonable assumption\u201d that if someone has developed antibodies for the virus, they\u2019ve had the infection and are protected. But scientists aren\u2019t sure how long that antibody protection lasts. In South Korea, a growing number of recovered patients appear to be relapsing. Korean authorities reported that 163 patients have tested positive for the virus after making a full recovery. \u201cWe need to be humble and modest that we don\u2019t know everything\u201d about Covid-19, Fauci said. Fact check: Testing again \u201cOur best scientists and health experts assess that states today have enough tests to implement the criteria of phase one if they choose to do that,\u201d Mike Pence said. Physicians groups, academic labs, and local leaders have all said they do not have the ability to do enough testing. One example is Rhode Island. Here\u2019s some reporting from the AP, from earlier today: Trump has promoted a 15-minute test developed by Abbott Laboratories as a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Federal officials initially distributed 15 machines to public health labs in U.S. states and territories, along with 250 to the Indian Health Service. Alaska received 50. But governors say they didn\u2019t get enough cartridges needed to run large numbers of the tests. Rhode Island received only 120, much fewer than they were promised. Raimondo said when the state tried to get more, Abbott and others that make the test cartridges directed her to the federal government, which in turn told her to go directly to the companies. The state has now received 850 tests, far fewer than it requested, Raimondo said Friday. \u201cFollowing the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacities,\u201d Trump said. State and local leaders have complained that they are having trouble getting equipment, including swabs, needed to ramp up testing. Fact Check: Testing Trump is touring the US\u2019 testing capacity. Overall, the US had administered more than 3.5m coronavirus tests so far, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Recently, it matched the rate of testing per capita of South Korea, though other countries, including Germany, we have tested a larger proportion of its population. From a very slow start, the US, with a population of 329 million, had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 100 people \u2014 similar to South Korea. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. The UK, however, is behind, having tested only 1 in 230 people. In America, despite the recent increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many people with symptoms \u2014 including health workers \u2014 are still struggling to access tests. Trump says he will be sending out $19bn in relief to farmers, in addition to $28bn $ in bailout money sent to farmers to offset the impacts of his administration\u2019s tariffs on imports. The additional aid will take the form of \u201cdirect payments to farmers as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need,\u201d he said. Stay tuned for fact checks and analysis. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports from DC: South Dakota governor Kristi Noem announced Friday that her state would begin a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to fight the coronavirus. \u201cSouth Dakota is now the first state in America to launch a statewide, state-backed clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to fight COVID-19,\u201d Noem said in remarks sent out by her office. \u201cWe\u2019re testing it both as a therapeutic to treat the disease and as a preventative measure. There have been many success stories about the effectiveness of this drug. Hopefully, our trial will gather the science, facts, and data to support those success stories.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that some hope could be effective against the coronavirus pandemic. But studies have been inconclusive on the effectiveness of the drug on the coronavirus. Donald Trump and some other Republicans have still recommended using the drug. Noem has been criticized for responding too slowly to the pandemic. South Dakota has not issued a stay at home order and has experienced a 205 percent hike coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In her remarks, Noem said it\u2019s up to individuals to be responsible about the pandemic. \u201cThough I\u2019ve taken some criticism from the mainstream media for our targeted, thoughtful approach, the data and the facts continue to show that the people of South Dakota have taken my guidance seriously,\u201d Noem said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, my role with respect to public safety is something I take very seriously. But the people themselves are primarily responsible for their safety. They are the ones entrusted with expansive freedoms - they are free to exercise their rights to work, worship, and play - or to stay at home, or to conduct social distancing.\u201d Noem said the South Dakota Department of Health\u2019s projections show a reduction in coronavirus cases. \u201cThis week, Department of Health staff along with chief medical officials from Avera, Monument, and Sanford presented updated projections that show a further flattening of our curve,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIn total, thanks to the diligence of South Dakotans, we\u2019ve cut our peak hospitalization projections by 75 percent. \u201c After the president tweeted \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d on Friday morning, as well as \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d online far-right communities speculated over whether Trump was advocating armed conflict, NBC reports: Anti-government sentiment has percolated among far-right extremists in recent weeks over the stay-at-home orders governors have issued to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Trump\u2019s tweets, however, pushed many online extremist communities to speculate whether the president was advocating for armed conflict, an event they\u2019ve termed \u201cthe boogaloo,\u201d for which many far-right activists have been gearing up and advocating since last year. There were sharp increases on Twitter in terms associated with conspiracies such as QAnon and the \u201cboogaloo\u201d term immediately following the president\u2019s tweets, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute, an independent nonprofit group of scientists and engineers that tracks and reports on misinformation and hate speech across social media. Posts about the \u201cboogaloo\u201d on Twitter skyrocketed in the hours after the president\u2019s tweets, with more than 1,000 tweets featuring the term, some of which received hundreds of retweets. Hi there it\u2019s Maanvi, blogging from the West Coast. Soon, we\u2019ll be covering the White House press briefing, and fact-checking the president\u2019s claims. In the meantime, Samantha Power, the former US ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration, has taken on the president on Twitter. Refuting Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Barack Obama and Joe Biden \u201cwere a disaster in handling the H1N1 swine flu,\u201d Powers refuted that the FDA approved a test kit within two weeks of the identification of an outbreak. Indeed, in 2009, soon after the CDC raised concerns about a virulent new strain of swine flu circulating in California and Texas, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, then the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s principal deputy commissioner, has test kits swiftly approved through an FDA process called \u201cEmergency Use Authorization.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Washington governor Jay Inslee said Trump was \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d with his tweets about liberating states under stay-at-home orders. Trump\u2019s tweets echoed messaging from right-wing protesters who have demonstrated against the orders, and they raised concerns that the president\u2019s supporters would feel encouraged to ignore social distancing guidelines. Andrew Cuomo criticized Trump after the president lashed out against the New York governor in a tweet. In response to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Cuomo should \u201cspend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining,\u2019\u201d the governor said, \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d California is nearing 1,000 coronavirus deaths. Governor Gavin Newsom said California recorded 95 deaths yesterday, making it the deadliest day so far and bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 985. Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to \u201crewrite history\u201d on how he first responded to coronavirus. \u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left American exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic,\u201d Biden said in a new video. \u201cHe ignored the warnings of health experts and the intelligence agencies and put his trust in China\u2019s leaders instead.\u201d The US daily coronavirus death toll hit a new record yesterday. According to the Wall Street Journal, 4,591 Americans died over 24 hours, nearly doubling the record of 2,569 that was set on Wednesday. The country\u2019s total death currently stands at 34,614. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, accused Trump of \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies\u201d with his tweets about liberating states currently under stay-at-home orders. \u201cYesterday, the president told the nation science would guide his plan for easing restrictions. The White House released a sensible plan to resume economic activity,\u201d Inslee wrote in a tweet. \u201c24 hrs later he is off the rails, ignoring his own plan and spewing dangerous, anti-democratic rhetoric.\u201d At yesterday\u2019s news conference, Trump said governors should be \u201cempowered\u201d to make their own decisions about how and when to reopen their states. But the president\u2019s tweets today echoed messaging from right-wing protesters, some of whom have ignored social distancing guidelines to demonstrate against the stay-at-home orders in Michigan and Minnesota. Washington state was one of the first states to report an outbreak of coronavirus, and 590 residents have already died from the virus. Minnesota governor Tim Walz said he has been unable to reach the president or the vice president to decipher the meaning of Trump\u2019s \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d tweet. The Democratic governor told the Wall Street Journal that his calls to the White House in the past couple of hours have gone unreturned. Trump\u2019s tweet echoed messaging from right-wing protesters who have expressed outrage about stay-at-home orders meant to limit the spread of coronavirus. Walz has issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which is currently in effect until at least May 4, and hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the governor\u2019s mansion earlier today to protest the order, completely ignoring social distancing guidelines. Trump\u2019s surprising announcement yesterday that gyms would be included in \u201cphase one\u201d of the economy reopening reportedly came one day after the president spoke to the chairman of SoulCycle\u2019s parent company. The Daily Beast reports: The inclusion struck public health experts as bizarre. \u2018Gyms are like a petri dish,\u2019 said Laurence Gostin, the director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u2018People are close to one another, they\u2019re sweating, they\u2019re coughing and sneezing, they\u2019re touching multiple surfaces, they\u2019re sharing equipment, they\u2019re indoors. Literally all of the heightened risk factors for COVID transmission are all entwined together in a gym.\u2019 The White House\u2019s guidance included mitigation measures that would ostensibly minimize the risk of transmission at gyms that opt to reopen, including \u2018strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols.\u2019 But Gostin said he\u2019s not convinced that the risks of transmission could be sufficiently minimized. ... The decision on gyms came a day after Trump\u2019s phone call with sixteen business leaders including Stephen Ross, the founder and chairman of the Related Companies. That firm\u2019s portfolio includes Equinox Holdings, which owns its own eponymous chain of luxury gyms as well as fitness brands SoulCycle, Blink Fitness, and Pure Yoga. Those businesses, like the larger fitness industry, have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus. SoulCycle has slashed payroll and furloughed employees. Equinox and Blink have both frozen membership charges. Ross has previously faced backlash for his connections to Trump. When it was announced last summer that Ross would host a Hamptons fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign, a number of SoulCycle and Equinox customers said they would boycott the companies. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: As California\u2019s death toll climbs, state leaders are sketching a plan to battle the other front of the pandemic: the economic fallout. \u201cWe are now in a pandemic-induced recession here in the state of California,\u201d governor Gavin Newsom said. Already 3.1 m people in California have filed for unemployment since 12 March, helping raise the unemployment rate to 5.3%. But that figure doesn\u2019t capture all state residents who are out of work. In response to the rising unemployment, Newsom said he\u2019s formed an economic recovery panel to guide California back to job growth. The board will be led by former presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Joining him will be Newsom\u2019s chief of staff, Ann O\u2019Leary, Apple CEO Tim Cook, former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen and Disney head Robert Iger. The 80-member group will also include all four of California\u2019s living ex-governors: Jerry Brown, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gray Davis and Pete Wilson. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: California is nearing the grim milestone of 1,000 deaths attributed to the coronavirus, a mark that governor Gavin Newsom said \u201cwe hoped we would never see.\u201d Yesterday saw 95 deaths across the Golden State, California\u2019s deadliest day so far. That brings California\u2019s total death toll to 985. Six US states have already seen at least 1,000 deaths from the virus: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois and Louisiana. Meanwhile, California\u2019s rate of hospitalizations for Covid-19 cases indicates that it\u2019s still premature to lift social distancing restrictions. While adminissions to ICUs dropped by 1.4% yesterday, hospitalizations overall ticked up by 1.2%. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said lawmakers were making some progress on the next coronavirus relief bill. \u201cI think we got a little [progress],\u201d the California Republican told Politico. \u201cOnly because the pressure is mounting in the Democratic conference.\u201d Republicans and Democrats have been at a stalemate over the scope of the bill, with Democrats pushing for more money for hospitals and state and local governments as well as the small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program. Republicans have argued the next bill should be focused solely on PPP, which was originally granted $350bn in funds from the stimulus package and ran out of money yesterday. McCarthy expressed openness to giving money to hospitals but not state governments. \u201cA deal would look like the PPP,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou could possibly get some hospital [funds]. I think that would be the deal. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get any state money.\u201d Governors have warned their states are running desperately low on cash, and the National Governors Association said last week that states need $500bn from Congress to adequately address the current crisis. Twitter said Trump\u2019s tweets calling for states with stay-at-home orders to be liberated did not violate the platform\u2019s rules, according to a New York Times reporter. A Twitter spokesperson said Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cvague and unclear\u201d and thus did not constitute a clear threat, even though a number of people raised concerns that the messages might encourage the president\u2019s supporters to ignored stay-at-home orders and jeopardize their health. Hours after the president sent the tweets, an anti-lockdown protest occurred outside the Minnesota governor\u2019s mansion, and footage showed hundreds of demonstrators standing close together and not wearing masks. Florida governor OKs reopening beaches, parks Florida governor Ron DeSantis green lit some municipalities to start opening parks and beaches. In a news conference in Fort Lauderdale, the governor said permissions would be given if reopening can be done safely, with social distancing guidelines still in place. The AP reports: The governor said it was important for people to have outlets for getting exercise, sunshine and fresh air. \u201cDo it in a good way. Do it in a safe way,\u201d DeSantis said. Florida officials were criticized for leaving beaches open during part of the spring break period last month. Most counties closed their beaches in response or kept them open under very restrictive conditions. Other more high-profile beaches in South Florida including Miami Beach were closed by state order. Florida\u2019s northern beaches became among the first to allow beach-goers to return, permitting residents to walk, bike, hike, fish, run, or swim during limited hours beginning Friday afternoon. Crowds of more than 50 people would still be banned. Texas to close schools for rest of academic year Texas governor Greg Abbott ordered schools remain closed through the remainder of the school year. The Republican governor announced the order in a Friday news conference. From the El Paso Times: Abbott previously ordered schools closed to students until May 4, but did not rule out extending his order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. He said Friday the team of doctors advising his office determined \u201cit would be unsafe for students to gather in schools for the foreseeable future.\u201d The Texas Education Agency, the state entity overseeing primary and secondary education, released a statement in support of the decision. According to the Times, the order applies to public, charter and private K-12 schools, and higher education institutions. Florida officials attempted blocking COVID-19 data from public The Miami Herald reports that as Gov. Ron DeSantis touted Florida as one of the most transparent states in coronavirus reporting, state attorneys and lawmakers attempted to block COVID-19 information from being released to the public. From the Herald: Emails and phone conference appointments obtained through a public records request show that, while medical examiners across Florida had already released details about deaths in their counties, attorneys for the state spent more than a week trying to convince their counterparts in Miami-Dade County not to provide that information to the Herald. CNN reports call between Pence, Democrats did not go as planned CNN is reporting that a call between Vice President Mike Pence and top Democratic senators to discuss the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak did not go as planned. From CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox: Fox went on to confirm that Hawaii senator Brian Schultz to her Democrats were frustrated with the administration\u2019s delays, relaying that officials still had not \u201cassessed how many tests they need every day.\u201d California senator Kamala Harris, in an interview with Vice News, slammed President Donald Trump for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In the interview, the senator called the delayed response to social distancing recommendations, and roll out of testing, directly responsible for the country\u2019s more than 680,000 cases, and 30,000 deaths. The senator is among a short list of women rumor to be considered as former vice President Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in the 2020 Presidential Election. From Vice News\u2019 senior editor Hayley Jones: Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside the Minnesota governors\u2019 mansion to protest the statewide stay-at-home order. Footage of the protest showed demonstrators standing closely together and not wearing masks, potentially risking spread of coronavirus at the event. Videos also showed protesters waving Americans flags and at least one \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flag as they demonstrated against Democratic governor Tim Walz\u2019s stay-at-home order, which is in effect until at least May 4. Trump wrote in a tweet earlier today, \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d The tweet echoed messaging from right-wing protesters in recent days and raised concerns that the president\u2019s supporters would feel encouraged to ignore social distancing guidelines, as the Minnesota demonstrators are doing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has just released a video message on Twitter attacking the president for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. He\u2019s also not impressed with how China has handled data on the outbreak that began there late last year. \u201cAs I speak, China is censoring research on Covid-19, making it harder for the rest of us to beat the virus,\u201d Biden begins in his message from home in Delaware. He then goes on: \u201cPresident Trump is not doing enough about it. The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left American exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and the intelligence agencies and put his trust in China\u2019s leaders instead. \u201cAnd now, we\u2019re all paying the price.\u201d The former vice president in Barack Obama\u2019s administration goes on to say that the Trump administration reduced the US\u2019s readiness for a pandemic. Then says Trump was \u201cmore interested in his trade deal with China than about the virus, which had already come to America.\u201d Biden pinpoints February as a crucial time when Trump was not acting on his experts\u2019 advice - echoing piercing questions from the press at the particularly tumultuous White House press briefing last Monday. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has just reported that, in New Jersey, 323 people died of Covid-19 yesterday. Although a horrific number for a one day toll, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,840 deaths from the disease, it nevertheless gave the governor a spark of hope. A total of 362 people had died in the state the day before. Murphy said, according to Reuters. He said the rate of spread of coronavirus in New Jersey has \u201cdropped dramatically\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Voting rights groups are continuing to pressure Congress to include funding for expanding vote by mail in the next coronavirus stimulus package. Stand Up America, a progressive advocacy group, said Friday they had made 20,000 phone calls to members of congress urging them to include at least $4 billion in funding for expanding voting. They urged members to support expanding vote by mail, as well as measures like expanded early voting and online voter registration. Activists made a similar push for funding ahead of the last stimulus bill, and Congress included $400 million in the measure, a significant amount, but only a small fraction of what states said they needed. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have resisted these efforts, saying they are designed to help Democrats win elections. Switching to vote by mail has no partisan effects, according to a recent study by researchers at Stanford. \u201cStates need funding now to expand vote-by-mail and early voting\u2014and to ensure that we protect all poll workers and voters. Unless Congress acts now, voters may be forced to choose between protecting their health and casting their ballot this fall,\u201d said Sean Eldridge, the president and founder of Stand Up America. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Andrew Cuomo criticized Trump after the president lashed out against the New York governor in a tweet. In response to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Cuomo should \u201cspend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining,\u2019\u201d the governor said, \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d Cuomo went on to offer some of his harshest criticism of Trump since the start of the current crisis. Trump said three states should be liberated from their stay-at-home orders. \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d Trump said. The tweet echoes messaging from far-right protesters and raised concerns that the president\u2019s supporters would feel encouraged to ignore stay-at-home orders. The US daily coronavirus death toll hit a new record yesterday. According to the Wall Street Journal, 4,591 people died over 24 hours, nearly doubling the record of 2,569 that was set on Wednesday. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump again lashed out against Andrew Cuomo over Twitter, mocking the New York governor for \u201cridiculously\u201d requesting 40,000 ventilators. \u201cState should have had them in stockpile!\u201d Trump tweeted. Cuomo said late last month that the state needed 30,000 ventilators to address the surge in coronavirus cases, and the governor emphasized at his press conference today that his requests were based on the federal government\u2019s projections of the outbreak. \u201cRead your own report next time before you criticize,\u201d Cuomo said of Trump. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s some of what he said: Cuomo criticized Trump for inaction after the president lashed out against the governor in a tweet. Trump suggested Cuomo should do \u201cspend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining.\u2019\u201d When asked about the tweet, Cuomo replied, \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s comments represented some of his harshest criticism of Trump since the start of the crisis. The Democratic governor has generally tried to avoid getting involved in fights with Trump to protect New York\u2019s relationship with the federal government, but Cuomo said the president was asking to be thanked for merely doing his job. \u201cThis was your role as president,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo demanded more funding for states, as governors have received the bulk of responsibility for reopening. The governor said the federal government could not expect states to take on so many duties without giving them additional funding. \u201cThat is passing the buck without passing the bucks,\u201d Cuomo said. Coronavirus hospitalizations are \u201cundeniably on the decline\u201d in New York, Cuomo said. But the state\u2019s daily death toll from the virus remains high and stable. Another 630 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, marking a slight increase from Wednesday\u2019s death toll of 606. New York governor Andrew Cuomo reiterated that the federal government must be involved in expanding testing capacity, after Trump tweeted it was up to the states to make tests more widely available. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have federal help on testing, that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor warned that if the federal government does not get involved, states could face an alarming shortage of tests, as they did for personal protective equipment at the onset of the coronavirus crisis. Trump sent a series of tweets trying to deflect responsibility for the coronavirus crisis, suggesting states are the ones who need to expand testing capacity. However, a number of governors from both parties have said they need assistance from the federal government to make testing more widely available. \u201cThe federal government cannot wash its hand of this,\u201d Cuomo said at the beginning of his briefing. \u201cWe cannot do it without federal help.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo emphasized the states had the power to reopen the economy, as guaranteed by the Constitution. \u201cHe\u2019s doing nothing,\u201d Cuomo said of Trump after the president sent a critical tweet about the governor. \u201cAll he\u2019s doing is walking in front of the parade.\u201d This is some of the strongest criticism Cuomo has offered of Trump since the start of the coronavirus crisis, as the governor has tried to avoid fighting with the president to protect the state\u2019s relationship with the federal government. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was grateful for some of the steps that the federal government has taken, such as sending the Navy hospital ship Comfort to New York Harbor. But the Democratic governor emphasized those steps were part of Trump\u2019s responsibility as president. \u201cI\u2019m saying thank you for doing your job,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis was your role as president.\u201d Cuomo reiterated that the numbers New York used to project how many hospital beds the state would need, which Trump complained were overstated, were based on figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In response to Trump\u2019s critical tweet, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said that federal and state governments cannot stop working to address the effects of coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe have a lot more to do.\u201d Cuomo also emphasized that, while Trump has now acknowledged governors will decide how and when to reopen the economy, governors already had that power from the 10th Amendment of the Constitution. \u201cI didn\u2019t need the president of the United States to tell me I\u2019m governor,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo responded to Trump\u2019s tweet suggesting he should \u201cspend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining.\u2019\u201d The Demcratic governor, who has tried to avoid getting entangled in fights with the president, replied, \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d Cuomo also noted the projected number of beds that New York said it needed, which Trump complained was overblown, was based on numbers provided by the White House coronavirus task force. \u201cThey\u2019re your projections, Mr President,\u201d Cuomo said. Trump lashed out aginst Andrew Cuomo as the New York governor held his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Cuomo said moments ago that the federal government could not put so much responsibility on the states in terms of reopening the economy without giving them substantially more funding. \u201cThat is passing the buck without passing the bucks,\u201d Cuomo said. Trump quickly responded over Twitter. \u201cGovernor Cuomo should spend more time \u2018doing\u2019 and less time \u2018complaining,\u2019\u201d said the president, who has taken to holding daily briefings that have sometimes run for more than two hours. \u201cLess talk and more action!\u201d Trump also pointed out that New York has received more assistance than any other state, but of course that\u2019s because New York has seen far more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other US state so far. New York governor Andrew Cuomo emphasized that economic concerns cannot outweigh public health as the states looks toward reopening. \u201cYes, everybody wants the economy running, but everybody wants to be safe, too,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor has said the rate of infection needs to continue to fall before New York\u2019s economy can fully reopen. Donald Trump\u2019s call on Twitter to \u201cliberate\u201d three key election states run by Democratic governors \u2013 Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia \u2013 has alarmed many commentators on the left and right. As Media Matters\u2019 Matt Gertz has noted, the outburst came shortly after a Fox News segment on anti-lockdown protesters: A recent poll also suggests Trump\u2019s demands are significantly out of step with the thinking of a majority of Americans: Here\u2019s how people have been responding elsewhere: New York governor Andrew Cuomo said states were asking for $500 billion in economic relief, but it\u2019s unclear how much of that would go to New York. Democratic lawmakers are pushing for the next coronavirus relief bill to include more funding for state and local governments, as well as hospitals. However, Republicans have advocated for a bill only granting additional funds to the small business loan program created by the stimulus package, arguing lawmakers should wait on other negotiations. New York governor Andrew Cuomo got a little personal during his daily briefing, explaining how the coronavirus quarantine had given him more quality time with his daughters. Cuomo said his interactions with his daughter had become \u201cso superficial,\u201d and the unexpected time at home had allowed him to get to know them better. \u201cThey\u2019re not four, five, six, seven, ten years old anymore,\u201d Cuomo said of his three daughters. \u201cThey\u2019re grown up.\u201d Cuoma also said his current inability to see his elderly mother had made him regret not spending more time with her. \u201cI know I\u2019ve learned a lot on a personal level,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo insisted states needed more funding to tackle the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo said the federal government\u2019s guidelines on reopening, which put the onus on governors to decide how and when to reopen, are appropriate. But Cuomo added that it was unrealistic for the federal government to put so much responsibility on the states without giving them more money to implement their decisions. \u201cThat is passing the buck without passing the bucks,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would issue an executive order requiring the state\u2019s public and private labs to work with the government to prioritize coronavirus testing. But Cuomo emphasized it would not be possible to substantially expand testing capacity without a partnership between the federal government and state governments. \u201cThe federal government cannot wash its hand of this,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe cannot do it without federal help.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state was looking ahead to reopening, even as officials continue to pay close attention to the rate of infection spread. \u201cThe situation we\u2019re in now is unsustainable,\u201d Cuomo said, acknowleding people cannot indefinitely stay at home as the current order requires. But Cuomo reiterated that the state would need to substantially expand testing in order to fully reopen without risking a surge in infections. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said coronavirus hospitalizations in the state had once again slightly declined yesterday. Cuomo said the net change in hospitalizations is \u201cundeniably on the decline,\u201d as many coronavirus patients recover and are released from the hospital. But New York\u2019s daily death toll remains high and stable. Another 630 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, marking a slight increase from Wednesday\u2019s death toll of 606. Trump has sent a string of incendiary tweets calling on states currently under stay-at-home orders to be liberated. The surprising tweets come a day after Trump released the federal guidelines on reopening the economy and acknowledged governors would make the ultimate decision on how and when to reopen their states. \u201cGovernors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states,\u201d Trump said at yesterday\u2019s press conference. \u201cEvery state is very different.\u201d Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, is reportedly being released from prison because of the coronavirus pandemic, allowing him to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement. The AP reports: Cohen is currently locked up at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus. After he is released, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home, according to [a source]. Cohen began serving his sentence last May and was originally scheduled to be released in November 2021. His reported release comes as prison advocates have been pushing government officials to transfer more inmates to home confinement, particularly those who are in facilities deemed high-risk. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Switching to a vote by mail system modestly increases turnout, but doesn\u2019t favor one party over another, according to a new study. The study by researchers at Stanford University offers direct evidence to rebut Donald Trump and others who claim Democrats are pushing to make it easier to vote by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic to boost their political fortunes. The Stanford study focused on California, Utah and Washington -- all states that gradually phased in vote-by-mail across counties. They found that it didn\u2019t benefit Democrats and increased turnout by 2%. \u201cWe find that vote-by-mail has no apparent effect on either the share of turned-out voters who are Democrats or the share of votes that go to Democratic candidates, on average, although these latter estimates are a bit less precise,\u201d the researchers wrote. States across the country are scrambling to quickly implement vote-by-mail processes to ensure that people around the country can vote without having the risk their health. Several states are mailing absentee ballot applications to active voters and easing restrictions on who can cast an absentee ballot. Republicans in Texas and Louisiana, so far, have been unwilling to ease those restrictions. In Georgia, House Speaker David Ralston said moving to mail-in balloting would be \u201cdevastating\u201d to conservatives. \u201cOur view is that this shouldn\u2019t be controversial if what people are worried about is that this electoral system would have some kind of partisan slant -- we don\u2019t see that,\u201d said Dan Thompson, one of the researchers who worked on the study, said in an interview. The authors of the study, which has yet to be published, noted that their study only compared a switch to vote by mail to voting in person under normal voting circumstances, not during a pandemic like Covid-19. \u201cIf, for example, we thought that people in one particular class were incredibly likely to vote for one party, and they were disproportionately affected by the virus, the virus itself might have a partisan impact on the election,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cCorrecting that effect by allowing people to vote by mail instead could ultimately result in returning to normal in terms of the partisan dynamics.\u201d China has revised the coronavirus death toll in its Wuhan region, where cases of the virus first appeared, from 2,579 to 3,869, marking a 50% increase. Beijing defended the revision, claiming officials had conducted a \u201cstatistical verification\u201d of the death toll and denying there had been any cover-up of the extent of the outbreak. Public health experts have cast doubt upon China\u2019s reported numbers, and the heightened activity of funeral homes in the Wuhan region indicates the coronavirus death toll there may be closer to 42,000. For more updates on the revision, follow the Guardian\u2019s global coronavirus blog: All non-essential permitted events in New York will be canceled for the month of May, mayor Bill de Blasio announced this morning. De Blasio said he is also considering canceling all concerts, parades and large gatherings scheduled for June. \u201cWe\u2019re far from out of the woods,\u201d he said. The mayor emphasized that, while New York has seen hopeful indicators that the city is flattening the curve, the economy cannot fully reopen until widespread coronavirus testing is available. Echoing New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s comments yesterday, de Blasio asked for the federal government to help expand testing capacity. Trump referred to Congress\u2019 extended recess due to the coronavirus pandemic as an \u201cendless vacation\u201d in a tweet criticizing Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. \u201cToday people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!\u201d Trump wrote in the tweet. Trump appears to be referencing the Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of money yesterday. Republicans have been pushing a bill to give more money to the small business loan program, which was created by the stimulus package last month. But Democrats are demanding that the bill also include more money for hospitals and state and local governments, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate. Trump\u2019s demand that members of Congress return to Washington comes two days after DC mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city\u2019s stay-at-home order until May 15 as coronavirus cases in the region continue to climb. The number of coronavirus tests being conducted each week in the US has hit a wall, just as public health experts warn the country needs to substantially ramp up testing to reopen the economy. Axios reports: Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said he thinks we need to be doing 500,000 tests a day for the foreseeable future. Nationwide testing capacity steadily increased for weeks, but has appeared to hit a wall around 145,000 tests a day. Several factors are holding it back: Supply shortages for key test ingredients, swabs, test kits, and personal protective equipment. Poor coordination: Some labs have excess testing capacity, but aren\u2019t being sent samples from the providers collecting them. Rules about who gets tested: Many states have limited testing to the sickest patients, and caseloads are dropping overall. But clinicians often have discretion as to who they test. Many health experts have warned that states will see a surge in coronavirus cases once the economy reopens if they do not have enough tests to identify and isolate new patients. Joe Biden told donors in a virtual fundraiser last night that he is already considering his potential cabinet if he wins the election in November. \u201cI promise you that has already begun,\u201d the assumed Democratic nominee said. \u201cSounds presumptuous. ... I don\u2019t want it to sound like that, but it has to happen and that\u2019s why the transition team is already being put together.\u201d Biden interestingly said some Republicans have reached out to him about potentially serving in his administration, which could spark concern among some Democrats. \u201cI have had literally several hundred serious, serious players who have been held positions in every department in the federal government who have said, including some Republicans, who have said if you win, I want to come back. I\u2019m ready to serve,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president received some criticism when he said in August, \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of really good Republicans out there. ... I get in trouble for saying that with Democrats, but the truth of the matter is, every time we ever got in trouble with our administration, remember who got sent up to Capitol Hill to fix it? Me. Because they know I respect the other team.\u201d Trump\u2019s deference to governors yesterday as he unveiled federal guidelines on reopening the economy was a marked shift from earlier in the week. Reading from prepared remarks, Trump said governors should take a \u201cphased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states.\u201d \u201cWe are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time, and some states will be able to open up sooner than others,\u201d Trump said, as a number of states and cities announced they would extend their stay-at-home orders until at least May 15. \u201cGovernors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEvery state is very different.\u201d The president saying governors would be \u201cempowered\u201d to make their own decisions on when to ease restrictions is a rather different message from earlier in the week, when Trump falsely claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority to reopen the country. On a call with governors yesterday, Trump similarly told the state leaders that they would be able to \u201ccall your own shots\u201d about reopening, indicating the president is recognizing he will not have much say in when states start to reopen schools and non-essential businesses. A wave of planned anti-lockdown demonstrations that have broken out around the country included far-right groups as well as more mainstream Republicans. While protesters in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and other states claim to speak for ordinary citizens, many are also supported by street-fighting rightwing groups like the Proud Boys, conservative armed militia groups, religious fundamentalists, anti-vaccination groups and other elements of the radical right. On Wednesday in Lansing, Michigan, a protest put together by two Republican-connected not-for-profits was explicitly devised to cause gridlock in the city, and for a time blocked the entrance to a local hospital. It was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, which Michigan state corporate filings show has also operated under the name of Michigan Trump Republicans. It was also heavily promoted by the Michigan Freedom Fund, a group linked to Trump cabinet member Betsy DeVos. But the protest also attracted far right protest groups who have been present at pro-Trump and gun rights rallies in Michigan throughout the Trump presidency. Placards identified the Michigan Proud Boys as participants in the vehicle convoy. Near the state house, local radio interviewed a man who identified himself as \u201cPhil Odinson\u201d. In fact the man is Phil Robinson, the prime mover in a group called the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page features pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism, and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front. Good morning, live blog readers. The White House and a number of states are looking ahead to reopening the economy, but the severe effects of the coronavirus pandemic are still being felt across the country. The country\u2019s daily death toll hit a new record of 4,591 people yesterday, according to the Wall Street Journal. That figure is nearly double that of the previous record of 2,569, which was set on Wednesday. Overall, the US has recorded 33,286 deaths from coronavirus and confirmed 671,425 cases of the virus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. As the death toll continued to rise, the White Hosue released federal guidelines on a phased reopening for states, although the decision on when and how to reopen will ultimately lie with goverors. But Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, acknowledged the country still faced a long road ahead. A \u201clight switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to phase one until you get through the gating.\u201d",

This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. </p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago.</p> \n  <p>The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585.</p> \n  <p>The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered. Twenty-four hours later, the total had dropped to 72,963.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with one autonomous region that was using two sources of information, and we\u2019ve come across some information that lacks the consistency we try to ensure when we offer figures,\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Sim\u00f3n said the new data meant that past statistics needed to be revised and warned that it would be hard to gauge the coronavirus\u2019s true impact \u201cuntil the epidemic is over\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Official figures from the health ministry are based only on deaths of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. But a lot of people are likely to have died from the virus without having been tested, meaning their deaths do not figure in the official count. </p> \n  <p>This is particularly the case in care homes, where thousands of people have died untested, but showing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. According to figures analysed by El Pa\u00eds, <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-16/spanish-social-service-residences-have-seen-at-least-11600-coronavirus-deaths.html\">at least 11,600 people have died of the virus \u2013 or displaying symptoms associated with it \u2013 in Spanish care homes</a>.</p> \n  <p>Those deaths would account for almost two-thirds of the nationwide fatalities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:33:53.287Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9995b68f08cf571cdb2dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:42:31.834Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Jamaican bobsledder Sam Clayton Jr, who inspired the popular Cool Runnings movie, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/sam-clayton-dies-coronavirus-jamaica-bobsleigh-team-cool-runnings-1498502\">died late last month of coronavirus</a>. </p> \n  <p>The 58-year-old was part of the Jamaican bobsleigh team that qualified for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. </p> \n  <p>Clayton is survived by his wife, Annie, a daughter, three sons and three grandchildren.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:34:14.022Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9992848f08ea7431f44a44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:38:13.059Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some <strong>European</strong> countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions on social life, transport and cross-border travel.

You can also see our latest summary of events at Coronavirus latest developments: at a glance. Oliver Milman, an environment reporter for Guardian in New York, has some analysis on the progression of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots. But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening? That will be a communication challenge for us, but we have to just keep monitoring and see where we are going on this.\u201d Abba Kyari, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s chief of staff, has died after contracting coronavirus, a spokesman for the president has confirmed. On the protestors who gathered around the country and flouted distancing measures, Trump said, \u201cThey seem to be very responsible people to me.\u201d Demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, which have drawn elements of the far right, have been held in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Here are a few more updates from the White House daily briefing, which is ongoing. Trump has been asked to address a series of incendiary tweets which appeared to stoke protests against physical distancing and other stay-at-home measures in three states led by Democratic governors. Trump told reporters he is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with what he posted. He said that some states are going too far with social distancing measures. But states are currently following federal guidelines encouraging Americans to stay home. Earlier on Friday, Trump had tweeted: \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d and: \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d \u2013 a reference to Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, last week signing into law new measures on gun control. So far at the White House\u2019s daily briefing: Trump has said he will be sending out $19bn in relief to farmers, in addition to $28bn in bailout money sent to farmers to offset the impacts of his administration\u2019s tariffs on imports. Trump added that: \u201cFollowing the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacities.\u201d State and local leaders have complained that they are having trouble getting equipment, including swabs, needed to ramp up testing. Yesterday, to speed up testing and address supply shortages, the FDA announced that it would allow a broader range of swabs to be used for tests, including some that would be easier to manufacture. But the messaging from Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force response coordinator, Dr Anthony Fauci, the US\u2019 top infectious disease expert, and Dr Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, is that there will be enough testing, soon. Trump, meanwhile, has been insisting that the testing capacity is already where it needs to be. \u201cIf about 1 out of 10 people are positive,\u201d Giroir said, then health officials know that they are testing enough people.

You can follow it live on our US-focused blog here: In the UK, two men were arrested and another was injured in a motorbike collision after around 150 people flouted physical distancing rules to attend a funeral. The funeral in Sittingbourne on Thursday was attended by large numbers of motorcyclists, and two men \u2013 aged 24 and 32 \u2013 were both arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and driving without a licence. A 17-year-old boy was seriously injured when he was hit by a bike. Kent police said they informed about the funeral the evening beforehand but did not get chance to speak to those involved to remind them of physical distancing measures. New data suggests that the pandemic\u2019s toll in Ecuador may be much higher than previously indicated, after figures revealed a massive jump in deaths in the province at the centre of the country\u2019s devastating outbreak. Since the beginning of March six weeks ago, 10,939 people have died in Guayas province, which includes Ecuador\u2019s largest city, Guayaquil, according to figures released late on Thursday. A man in his 50s has become the first person to die since the outbreak began in the Kurdish-dominated northern part of war-torn Syria, UN officials have said. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the administration of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of not having immediately informed its officials, saying the UN agency and the Syrian authorities would be to blame for the spread of the virus. The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said it received notice of the death from WHO on Thursday. AFP said the WHO was not available for comment. The WHO \u201cprovided information indicating that a fatality at Qamishli National Hospital in northeast Syria on 2 April had subsequently tested positive for COVID-19\u201d, OCHA said. A Brazilian judge has banned a group of Christian missionaries from entering a vast Amazon indigenous reserve with the world\u2019s highest concentration of isolated tribes, citing risks from the coronavirus pandemic as one of his reasons. Indigenous leaders and activists hailed the decision as \u201chistoric\u201d and expressed hope that it could prevent a genocide in the Javari valley, a remote reserve the size of Austria on Brazil\u2019s western borders. An unprecedented US policy authorising the summary expulsion of migrants and asylum seekers because of the pandemic violates international law, the United Nations has warned. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a sweeping order on 20 March encouraging the immediate deportation of non-citizens arriving overland without valid documents. The order cited an obscure quarantine law to claim the move is justified on public health grounds. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother temporarily released from prison in Iran due to the outbreak, does not yet know when she will have to return to complete her sentence. She was originally released for two weeks with an ankle tag but Iran remains in the grip of the pandemic on the eve of her scheduled return. The Iranian government claims there have been fewer than 5,000 deaths in total but pandemic modellers based in the US estimate that, as of 20 March, more than 15,000 have lost their lives. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has said: We are waiting on news tomorrow. Her lawyer will go to the prosecutor\u2019s office to check whether she needs to return to prison or it has been extended. English Premier League clubs have discussed resuming the season on the weekend of 13-14 June after Uefa wrote to domestic associations stating a desire they should finish their competitions by 31 July to leave August clear for the completion of the Champions League and Europa League. The letter from European football\u2019s governing body formed the basis of a two-hour conference call on Friday that explored how the Premier League may be concluded. The San Diego Comic-Con has been cancelled. The event, the largest fan convention in North America, had been due to attract more than 130,000 people to Southern California from 23-26 July. However, organisers said that in the light of the health crisis, it would not be safe for it to take place. It is the first time San Diego Comic-Con has been cancelled in its 50-year history. The US navy will carry out antibody testing of sailors aboard the virus-hit aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to determine whether they were exposed to the virus as it spread through the ship. The navy surgeon general, Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham, has said: We have scheduled the outbreak investigation to begin Monday and we are seeking crew member volunteers to provide an additional swab sample and a routine blood draw for laboratory testing. In addition, they will answer a short survey. The blood sample will undergo a new test that identifies Covid-19 antibodies in the blood. This type of testing is called a serology test. The results tell us if people have been exposed to the coronavirus and subsequently developed antibodies. Nature experts in Lebanon have noticed cleaner and clearer air filled with migratory birds as Beirut remains under lockdown during the pandemic. Migrating pelicans are flying over the city as environmentalists say birds seem to be venturing closer to urban areas: Tunisia\u2019s president has extended the country\u2019s lockdown, Reuters reports. The government is to announce the extension period later, the presidency said. This is the second extension of the lockdown, which started on 20 March as Tunisia struggles to stop the spread of the virus. More than 822 infections and 37 deaths have been declared. The number of people known to have died worldwide since the outbreak began has passed the 150,000 mark, according to two organisations tracking the data. Both Johns Hopkins University and the Reuters news agency, which are keeping separate counts, have said the figure has been exceeded, with the former putting it at 150,948. The first death came in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on 9 January. It took 83 days for the first 50,000 deaths to be recorded and just eight more for the toll to climb to 100,000. It took another eight days to go from 100,000 to 150,000, according to Reuters. In many countries, official data includes only deaths reported in hospitals, not those in homes or nursing homes, so the tolls are likely to be significant underestimates. The United States has recorded the most confirmed Covid-19, with more than 680,000 detected infections. Spain is next with around 188,000 cases, followed by Italy. Johns Hopkins University has counted more than 2.2m cases worldwide. Due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes, that figure is also likely to be an underestimate. Capt Moore originally set out to raise \u00a31,000 as a way of thanking staff following a hip replacement and showing support during the pandemic. The money is going to NHS Charities Together. Capt Tom Moore, the British second world war veteran who sought sponsorship for walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has now raised more than \u00a320m for National Health Service charities. Earlier, he was hailed as a \u201cone-man fundraising machine\u201d by the Duke of Cambridge: New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has criticised Donald Trump after the US president lashed out at him in a tweet. Trump\u2019s tweet suggested Cuomo should spend more time \u201cdoing\u201d and less time \u201ccomplaining\u201d. The governor said: \u201cIf he\u2019s sitting at home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d Almost 40% of the deaths in Wales have been in the area of south-east of the country covered by the Aneurin Bevan University health board, official figures reveal. There have been 190 deaths in the area, which includes the city of Newport and some south Wales valley communities. The total number of deaths in Wales is 506, according to Public Health Wales. The Aneurin Bevan area has been identified as a hotspot since the early days of the outbreak, with its proximity to England given by the Welsh government as one of the reasons. But there has been growing concern that the problem has been exacerbated by the number of people in the area who live in deprived neighbourhoods and have underlying health problems \u2013 plus the pressure the main hospital, the Royal Gwent, has been under. A sharp upward revision in China\u2019s death toll is an \u201cattempt to leave no case undocumented\u201d, the World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist, Maria van Kerkhove, has claimed. Kerkhove said the Chinese authorities had gone back over data from funeral services, care homes, fever clinics, hospitals and detention centres, as well as the number of patients who had died at home, in the city of Wuhan. The US president, Donald Trump, has previously suggested that China has understated its death toll and has condemned the WHO, claiming it has backed China\u2019s approach. The latest figures show that 1,081 sailors on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, flagship of the French navy, have tested positive for the coronavirus. Among them 545 are showing symptoms, 24 are in hospital and one in intensive care, according to the French armies minister Florence Parly. Parly said the figures were provisional as a further 300 sailors are awaiting the result of Covid-19 tests. Answering questions in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale on Friday, Parly said an investigation was underway to establish how the vessel, which has been at sea since 16 March - a day before the lockdown - became contaminated. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if the virus was already present on board before it docked (at Brest) on 13 March,\u201d Parly told MPs. The vessel returned to base at Toulon in the south of France two weeks early on Sunday. The crew has been placed in isolation for 14 days before being allowed to rejoin their families. The Charles de Gaulle, which carries up to 1,700 sailors and as many as 600 air crew, was docked at Brest on France\u2019s western coast between 13-15 March. It left Brest at 8am on 16 March, more than 24 hours before the national lockdown. The Charles de Gaulle, which carries Rafale fighter planes, Hawkeye surveillance and control aircraft as well as Caracal and Cougar helicopters and Aster anti-air missiles, had been on exercise since 21 January and spent several weeks in the Mediterranean as part of Operation Chammal, the French contribution to the international anti-terrorist operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria. It then sailed to the North Sea and then the Atlantic for \u201coperations of security and defence\u201d to European sea routes, said the ministry. The total death toll from the coronavirus in France has risen to 18,681 on Friday from 17,920, Reuters reports. The death toll in hospitals rose to 11,478 from 11,060, while the death toll in nursing homes rose to 7,203 from 6,860 on Thursday. Here\u2019s a video of lions and other wild animals relaxing in South Africa golf club during lockdown as visitors stay away. A journalist just asked WHO about Chile\u2019s immunity cards. Dr Michael Ryan said WHO does not have a position on this approach. He advises countries to be very prudent at this point, emphasising there is a lot of uncertainty on the effectiveness of such tests. He added that there are serious ethical issues to using immunity cards, which would allow some people to leave lockdowns. On Monday morning, Chile will become the first country to issue \u2018immunity cards\u2019 to those who have recovered from Covid-19, exempting holders from quarantine so that they can return to work. Chile\u2019s health minister announced that some of the cards would be issued according to the presence of antibodies to the virus, despite difficulties in producing reliable tests. He promised \u201cvery high probability\u201d that card holders would be non-contagious. Chile considers that patients are no longer contagious 14 days after acute symptoms were registered or after they are discharged from hospital in more serious cases. Those with weakened immune systems are only considered non-contagious 28 days after symptoms appeared. Concerns remain over the duration of recovered patients\u2019 resistance to the virus, with South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention announcing that 141 patients have re-tested positive having apparently recovered. Ever since the strategy was floated as a measure to lift quarantines, there have been concerns that the system could incentivise contagion, among those who feel that they might fight the virus off quickly, in order to return to work - or that a black market for immunity cards could thrive. Germany and Italy have mooted \u2018immunity passports\u2019 as an exit strategy as they look to ease lockdowns, while the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, suggested a wristband-based scheme for demonstrating immunity. The US is considering a similar policy. According to official statistics, Chile has registered 9,252 Covid-19 cases, more than half of which are in the capital, Santiago, which remains under quarantine. There have been 116 deaths. *This post has been amended. We originally reported that Italy\u2019s national health institute had said only about 10% of recovered patients have developed antibodies. That has been removed because, in fact, it is about 10% of all Italians. Global death toll exceeds 147,000: According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, nearly 2.2 million people have been confirmed as having contracted the virus worldwide, while at least 147,632 have died. The figures are likely to present an underestimate. More than 14,000 have died in UK hospitals: The British government announces that a further 847 people have died in UK hospitals; taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take account of the people who have died in other settings. Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded: The European commission says 98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak. South Asia sees 22,000 cases: The number of people in the south Asia region known to have been infected passes the 22,000 mark. Health officials warn that the region, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population, could be the new frontline against the disease because there are millions in densely populated areas and living under fragile public health systems. Increase in Italian cases slows: Deaths in Italy rise by 575, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declines slightly to 3,493 from a previous 3,786. The daily death toll is down considerably from peaks reached around the end of March. Health workers run out of protective gear: Health bosses in England are preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours. UK sets up vaccine taskforce: The UK\u2019s newly created vaccine taskforce will be asked to provide industry and research institutions with resources, review regulations and make preparations for large-scale production once a vaccine is developed. Pandemic\u2019s spread now \u2018controllable\u2019 in Germany: The reproduction number of the Covid-19 virus sinks to a new low in Germany, leading the health minister Jens Spahn to say there is enough evidence to declare the lockdown strategy a success. Jair Bolsonaro accused of leading Brazilians \u2018to slaughterhouse\u2019: The country\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has accused the incumbent of criminally irresponsible handling of the coronavirus as Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll hit 1,924. WHO\u2019s daily briefing on the coronavirus outbreak has just begun. WHO director Tarik Jasarevic said the coronavirus solidarity fund has generated $150m from more than 245,000 individuals, corporations and foundations. Deaths from the coronavirus epidemic in Italy rose by 575 on Friday, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declined slightly to 3,493 from a previous 3,786. The daily death toll is down considerably from peaks reached around the end of March, Reuters reports. The total death toll has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases climbed to 172,434 the third highest global tally behind the United States and Spain. Polish health minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Friday that the soonest safe elections in traditional form would be possible would be in two years, Reuters reports. Szumowski said the only other safe way to hold elections would be by post. Poland is scheduled to hold a presidential election in May and the ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) have advocated a postal vote. The US president, Donald Trump, has sent a series of incendiary tweets calling on states currently under stay-at-home orders to be liberated. The tweets follow yesterday\u2019s federal guidelines on reopening the economy, which acknowledged governors would make the ultimate decision on how and when to reopen their states. There\u2019s more information on our US coronavirus live blog: Cameroon, a country already facing multiple humanitarian emergencies, has surpassed 1,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The International Rescue Committee is calling for increased support to help mitigate the spread of the disease especially among the refugee and displaced population. Hannah Gibbin, Cameroon country director at the IRC, said: This milestone is an extremely concerning turning point for a country already facing multiple humanitarian emergencies. With almost 4 million people in need of humanitarian aid and the highest Covid-19 caseload across the Sahel and east Africa, this pandemic poses increased danger to people already suffering terrible violence. And with 2.5 million people already in need of urgent medical care without the outbreak, the health system is clearly ill prepared to handle a rapid escalation in cases despite the best efforts of the government and its partners. Refugees and people displaced from their homes do not have the luxury of social distancing and practising proper hygiene and sanitation. Most are living in crowded conditions, unable to maintain physical distance, ensuring the disease will continue to spread rapidly through the population. The French navy is investigating how the coronavirus infected more than 900 sailors onboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, AP reports. One person remains in intensive care and 20 others in hospital, the navy spokesman Commander Eric Lavault said on Friday. The director of the French military\u2019s health service arm, Maryline Gygax G\u00e9n\u00e9ro, told a parliamentary commission on Friday that 940 people had tested positive so far and 645 negative among the 2,300 sailors in the aeronaval group, which included several escort vessels. Other results were not yet available. A similar outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt led to the firing of its captain and the resignation this month of the acting US navy secretary, in a controversy about how that at-sea crisis was handled. Almost 100,000 European Union citizens remain stranded abroad as a result of coronavirus travel restrictions, the European commission has said. The EU executive announced on Friday that 98,900 EU citizens were stuck abroad with ongoing efforts to bring them home, in comparison to 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak. The commission said the EU had helped bring home more than half a million people, mostly through consular co-operation. Around 45,000 EU citizens have also been repatriated through nearly 200 EU funded flights, as well as 1,837 UK nationals. The UK remains in the Brexit transition period until the end of the year, so has the right to draw on the EU\u2019s civil protection mechanism, a system of mutual assistance during flood, forest fire or global pandemic. But the latest figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the programme, which means the EU will fund 75% of the cost of emergency repatriation flights. The UK has organised only six flights through the scheme, fewer than any large country apart from Italy. The government has not drawn on the scheme since 29 March, when British citizens and a handful of other EU nationals were flown out of Peru. In contrast, Germany has organised 101 such flights through the system, repatriating a total of 21,815 of its citizens with EU help. The Guardian reported that 65,000 UK nationals around the world are still in need of repatriation. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the numbers raised questions over the government\u2019s repatriation policy. The number of patients in Germany who have recovered from the coronavirus has been higher than the number of new infections every day this week, the German health minister said on Friday. Germany has the fifth highest Covid-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France at nearly 134,000 but has kept fatalities down to a relatively low 3,868 thanks to early and extensive testing, Reuters reports. Canadian banks processed more than 670,000 mortgage payment deferrals in the month since the measure was announced to help consumers weather the economic hit from the coronavirus epidemic, the Canadian Bankers Association said on Friday. Unrest has been rattling poor neighbourhoods across Colombia this week, as residents grow impatient with lockdown measures and unfulfilled promises of government-provided food relief. In Ciudad Bolivar, a rundown hillside district in Bogot\u00e1, the capital, riot police clashed from Tuesday until late on Thursday evening with residents, who demanded food supplies that were promised by the president, Ivan Duque, on 25 March, before the South American country\u2019s nationwide lockdown, but took weeks to arrive. Residents of poorer neighbourhoods across the city have begun tying red rags to their houses to signal that those inside are hungry and call for donations. On Thursday evening in Ciudad Bolivar, when authorities and members of the Red Cross were finally able to bring in food aid, protests quickly broke out, leaving four people injured. A police firearm was reportedly discharged, injuring a protester, which authorities say they are investigating. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair to me that this happens just for getting food,\u201d the mother of the injured protester told local media. Elsewhere in Colombia, other protests took place, with road blocks set up between cities by demonstrators calling for government help to survive the quarantine. Demonstrations also took place in Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019s second city, and other regional capitals. Latin America and the Caribbean, where 40% of the economy is informal, are little equipped for long-term lockdowns. Many members of the workforce live day to day and in precious housing. Benjamin Gedan, an analyst at the Wilson Center, a thinktank, said the coronavirus pandemic had exposed class faultlines across Latin America. \u201cThe region\u2019s poor are suffering the most, with no telecommuting opportunities, no savings, difficulty practising social distancing in their communities and often limited access to social welfare programmes,\u201d he said in an email. A group of regional ex-presidents and experts wrote a public letter calling the pandemic \u201cone of the most tragic episodes in the history of Latin America and the Caribbean\u201d. \u201cInstead of mobilising all capabilities at their disposal, some leaders have chosen to play populist and divisive politics in the midst of this tragedy,\u201d the letter went on to say. \u201cLatin Americans deserve much better.\u201d Indonesia reported 407 new coronavirus cases on Friday, according to Reuters. The total number of cases, 5,923, means it has surpassed the Philippines as the country with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. The US president, Donald Trump, has ramped up his attack on the World Health Organization with a tweet accusing the global body of not acting quickly enough on the virus. US airlines are estimated to be sitting on more than $10bn in travel vouchers that should have been cash refunds from cancelled flights, a group of US senators said on Friday. Reuters reports that many US airlines are cancelling between 60% and 80% of their flights, and under federal law passengers on those flights are entitled to full refunds. \u201cHowever, many airlines have been obfuscating this right by offering travel vouchers as the default option, requiring passengers to take burdensome steps to request refunds instead,\u201d the senators, Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, said in a statement. Switzerland\u2019s government urged residents against complacency on Friday, as the country\u2019s new coronavirus infection rate slows and lawmakers start relaxing restrictions to stem the disease\u2019s spread, Reuters reports. Daniel Koch, who has led the government\u2019s response at the public health ministry, told a press conference: \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from being out of the danger zone. There\u2019s a very big danger that more people become infected and that we will have additional, difficult cases.\u201d Switzerland will allow hairdressers, beauty salons and some other businesses to re-open from 27 April, followed by shops and schools next month. The official Swiss death toll from the coronavirus has reached 1,059 people, the country\u2019s public health agency said on Friday, rising from 1,017 on Thursday. From donning school uniform to raiding the fancy-dress box, Guardian readers share how they are dressing while they are forced to work in the house. A total of 14,576 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of Thursday. Don\u2019t forget to follow our UK live blog for more country-specific updates on the coronavirus. From Monday, people using public transport or visiting shops must be wearing face masks, according to the German news site Focus Online. The White Helmets, the collective of Syrian volunteers who rescue civilians from under the rubble of destroyed buildings, have been carrying out disinfection works as part of the fight against the coronavirus. The humanitarian group tweeted it was ensuring it reached people internally displaced in Syria. The number of people infected with the coronavirus crossed 22,000 in south Asia on Friday. Reuters reports warnings from health officials that the region, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population, could be the new frontline against the disease because of millions living in packed slums and fragile public health systems. The increase was driven by a rise in cases in India, while the Indian Ocean island nation of Maldives locked down its capital. India\u2019s caseload rose to 13,387, a jump of nearly 700 over the previous day, despite a harsh lockdown now in its fourth week and which will last at least until early May. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has rejected the idea that China has handled the coronavirus outbreak better than western democracies. In a wide-ranging interview published in Friday\u2019s Financial Times, Macron said that as a result of the coronavirus, \u201cwe all face the profound need to invent something new, because that is all we can do\u201d. He dismissed comparison between democratic countries where information flowed freely and citizens could criticise their governments and those where the truth was suppressed. \u201cGiven these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let\u2019s not be so naive as to say it\u2019s been much better at handling this,\u201d Macron told the the paper. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d Brazil\u2019s former health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta has said his country needs divine protection after his sacking by the president, Jair Bolsonaro, paved the way for a radical shift in coronavirus policy. Brazil\u2019s far-right president opposes social isolation and the partial lockdowns imposed by virtually all of Brazil\u2019s governors and, after dismissing Mandetta, Bolsonaro vowed to begin gradually reopening the country in order to protect the economy. Medical experts and Mandetta fear such steps will cause a jump in the number of coronavirus cases and place unbearable strain on Brazil\u2019s public health service. Intensive care units in several major Brazilian cities are already reported to be full or nearly full because of Covid-19. \u201cGod help us all,\u201d Mandetta told Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, one of Brazil\u2019s top political commentators, on Thursday after being fired, according to her account of a phone call with him. Ominously for those who fear Bolsonaro\u2019s plans will prove deadly for Brazil\u2019s 211 million citizens, Mandetta reportedly added: \u201cA completely different social dynamic is coming, which changes everything.\u201d The activist Greta Thunberg has continued her school strike for the climate from the safety of her own home. Last month, the Swedish teenager said it was \u201cextremely likely\u201d she had the Covid-19 virus. She issued an urgent warning to other young people to take the virus seriously, even if they themselves were often only facing mild symptoms. Spain\u2019s attempts to provide a more comprehensive overview of the coronavirus across the country\u2019s 17 autonomous regions appear to be running into problems. Last night, the government ordered all the regions to change their criteria for reporting deaths, infections and recoveries. It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes. On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago. The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585. The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered. Twenty-four hours later, the total had dropped to 72,963. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with one autonomous region that was using two sources of information, and we\u2019ve come across some information that lacks the consistency we try to ensure when we offer figures,\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n told reporters. Sim\u00f3n said the new data meant that past statistics needed to be revised and warned that it would be hard to gauge the coronavirus\u2019s true impact \u201cuntil the epidemic is over\u201d. Official figures from the health ministry are based only on deaths of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. But a lot of people are likely to have died from the virus without having been tested, meaning their deaths do not figure in the official count. This is particularly the case in care homes, where thousands of people have died untested, but showing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. According to figures analysed by El Pa\u00eds, at least 11,600 people have died of the virus \u2013 or displaying symptoms associated with it \u2013 in Spanish care homes. Those deaths would account for almost two-thirds of the nationwide fatalities. The Jamaican bobsledder Sam Clayton Jr, who inspired the popular Cool Runnings movie, died late last month of coronavirus. The 58-year-old was part of the Jamaican bobsleigh team that qualified for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Clayton is survived by his wife, Annie, a daughter, three sons and three grandchildren. Some European countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions on social life, transport and cross-border travel. Reuters has a roundup of those that have announced plans: Austria: Allowed thousands of shops to reopen on 14 April, becoming one of the first countries in Europe to loosen the lockdown. Shopping centres, larger shops and hairdressers are due to open from 1 May. Czech Republic: Shops will reopen on 20 April, larger stores to follow on 11 May, with restaurants and shopping malls returning to business on 8 June. Denmark: Will allow certain small businesses, such as hairdressers, beauty salons and driving schools, to reopen on 20 April, the government said on 17 April. The move comes after it began reopening day-care centres and schools this week in a first step towards gradually easing the lockdown. Germany: Will allow partial reopening of shops next week, and schools and hairdressers from 4 May. However, social distancing rules will remain in place until 3 May. Norway: Will ease curbs gradually, starting with the reopening of kindergartens on 20 April and schools from first to fourth grade a week later. The ban on hairdressers and makeup salons, as well as on the use of mountain cabins, will also be lifted in April. Poland: Will reopen parks and forests from 20 April and ease limits on the numbers of people in shops, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on 16 April, adding that he planned to ease the lockdown further every week or two. France\u2019s state-supported tracing app project StopCovid will not be ready when parliament debates it at the end of the month, the minister for digital affairs, C\u00e9dric O, said on Friday. He added that the app may not even be ready by 11 May, when the government plans to gradually lift the country\u2019s nationwide lockdown. Privacy campaigners have raised questions about the impact of the smartphone app - which tells users if they came into contact with a coronavirus carrier - on civil liberties. Reuters reports that a debate is scheduled in France\u2019s National Assembly on 28-29 April, but no formal vote is planned. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the coronavirus rose to 585 on Friday, up from 551 on Thursday, Reuters reports. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has decreased since the peak of the outbreak in early April when the country was registering over 900 deaths a day. The number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 188,068 on Friday from 182,816 on Thursday, a 2.9% increase. Britain will expand its criteria of who will be tested to include the police, fire service, judiciary and others, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday. There is currently capacity for 10,000 more tests a day to be carried out. He said: Now we\u2019ve got the curve under control, I want to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms and I anticipate being able to do that relatively soon because we\u2019re increasing capacity as I say. I can now give you the full figures for yesterday \u2013 at midday yesterday, we had done 18,665 tests in the previous 24 hours, 16,166 from pillar one, 2,323 from pillar two, and 176 from pillar four. So I know history of testing is going to be a long debated subject. What really matters is what we\u2019re going to do from here on in. And what I can tell you is that today we are able to expand the eligibility for testing which is currently for patients, for surveys and for NHS and social care staff, and some that go to LRFs for local urgent need. I can today expand the eligibility for testing to police, the fire service, prison staff, critical local authority staff, the judiciary and DWP staff who need it and we\u2019re able to do that because of the scale-up of testing. Global coronavirus cases pass 2.1 million. The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,158,250, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April. Deaths have passed 144,000. German health minister says pandemic\u2019s spread has become \u201ccontrollable\u201d. He was speaking as the reproduction number of the Covid-19 virus sank to a new low in the country. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from coronavirus meanwhile rose to 585 on Friday, up from 551 on Thursday but still far off figures of more than 900 registered during the peak of the outbreak in early April. Its number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 188,068 on Friday from 182,816 on Thursday, a 2.9% increase. Jair Bolsonaro accused of leading Brazilians \u201cto the slaughterhouse\u201d. The country\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva accused the incumbent of criminally irresponsible handling of coronavirus as Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll hit 1,924. Indonesia becomes south-east Asian country with most infections. The state reported 407 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of cases to 5,923 and surpassing the Philippines as the country with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. World\u2019s biggest trial of Covid-19 drugs starts in UK. The Recovery trial has recruited more than 5,000 patients in 165 NHS hospitals around the UK in a month, ahead of similar trials in the US and Europe, which have a few hundred. Wuhan death toll revised up 50%. Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has revised the death toll in Wuhan upwards by 50%, from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported death toll, as other countries have seen fatalities reach more than 10,000. China\u2019s GDP shrinks 6.8% in March quarter. China has reported its first ever quarterly contraction at 6.8%, its slowest pace on record. China\u2019s economy has not recorded a contraction since 1992 when the country began publishing quarterly GDP data. In 2019, China had already posted its slowest growth in almost 30 years. Donald Trump has issued guidelines for reopening the country, with three phases each dependent on states meeting certain criteria. The US president says states who meet phase 1 criteria can reopen tomorrow (on Friday), and that 29 states will reopen \u201crelatively soon\u201d. UN warns pandemic is turning into a \u2018child-rights crisis\u2019. The social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is potentially catastrophic for millions of children, according to a UN report launched Thursday. It said Covid-19 was turning into a broader child-rights crisis. Japan declares nationwide state of emergency. Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country. A third Japanese cabinet official has also tested positive for the virus. Germany\u2019s health minister says the pandemic\u2019s spread has become \u201ccontrollable\u201d, as the reproduction number of the Covid-19 virus sank to a new low in the country. Jens Spahn, a politician for the conservative CDU, said there was now enough evidence to declare the lockdown strategy a success, citing a lowering of the relative day-on-day growth of the pandemic in Germany. Since 12 April, the daily number of people who have recovered from the virus in Germany has been higher than the recorded number of new infections. \u201cWe have managed to bring dynamic growth back to linear growth\u201d, Spahn said. \u201cAs of today, the outbreak is once again controllable or more controllable.\u201d The president of the Robert Koch Institute, the central body in charge of disease control, cited Friday\u2019s new reproduction number of 0.7 as a sign the country\u2019s measures were working. The latest number, said Lothar Wieler, \u201cmeans that by now every infected person no longer on average infects another person\u201d. In a press conference on Wednesday, Merkel had stressed the importance of keeping the virus\u2019s reproduction number below 1. The Covid-19 mortality rate in Germany, which had drawn a lot of attention in the early phase of the pandemic, has meanwhile increased to 2.9%. Iran\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus rose by 89 in the past 24 hours to reach 4,958 on Friday, according to a health ministry spokesman. The total number of cases of infection reached 79,494, of which 3,563 were in critical condition, Kianush Jahanpur told state television. A parliamentary report released earlier this week said the coronavirus death toll might be almost double the figures announced by the health ministry, and the number of infections eight to 10 times more. The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Spain rose to 188,068 on Friday, the country\u2019s head of health emergencies, Fernando Simon, said at a news conference. Health authorities identified 5,252 new cases of the virus between Thursday and Friday, which represents a 2.9% increase. Denmark will begin to open up more businesses next week as it further eases virus restrictions, officials have announced. Following late-night negotiations between the main political parties, the government announced a deal for extending the first phase in the country\u2019s return to normality, the AFP news agency reports. \u201cNo one wants to keep Denmark closed for a day more than strictly necessary. But we must not move faster than what allows us to still keep the epidemic under control,\u201d the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said in a Facebook post. Denmark began reopening schools for younger children on Wednesday after a month-long closure to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, becoming the first country in Europe to do so. Hairdressers and tattoo parlours will start to reopen from Monday, and driving schools will start giving lessons again. Malaysian health officials have reported 69 new coronavirus cases, the lowest daily increase since the government imposed curbs on movement and business on 18 March, taking the cumulative total to 5,251 cases. The health ministry also reported two new deaths, bringing the total to 86. Jair Bolsonaro is leading Brazilians \u201cto the slaughterhouse\u201d with his criminally irresponsible handling of coronavirus, the country\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has said. In an impassioned interview with the Guardian \u2013 which came as Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll hit 1,924 \u2013 Lula said that by undermining social distancing and defenestrating his own health minister, Brazil\u2019s \u201ctroglodyte\u201d leader risked repeating the devastating scenes playing out in Ecuador, where families have had to dump their loved ones\u2019 corpses in the streets. \u201cUnfortunately I fear Brazil is going to suffer a great deal because of Bolsonaro\u2019s recklessness \u2026 I fear that if this grows Brazil could see some cases like those horrific, monstrous images we saw in Guayaquil,\u201d said the 74-year-old leftist. \u201cWe can\u2019t just want to topple a president because we don\u2019t like him,\u201d Lula admitted. \u201c[But] if Bolsonaro continues to commit crimes of responsibility \u2026 [and] trying to lead society to the slaughterhouse \u2013 which is what he is doing \u2013 I think the institutions will need to find a way of sorting Bolsonaro out. And that will mean you\u2019ll need to have an impeachment.\u201d Read the full interview here. Further problems around the UK\u2019s plans for testing are being flagged up at a committee hearing by British MPs, which you can watch here. Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, the professional body for British nurses, has told the House of Commons health committee that she has heard cases of nurses driving two hours to a testing centre and then being turned away. Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL\u2019s Institute for Global Health and a former director at the World Health Organization (WHO), has said meanwhile that the UK seems to be facing the highest death rates in Europe. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging those proceedings here. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will also face questions after the initial witnesses. Indonesia has reported 407 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of cases to 5,923 and surpassing the Philippines as the country with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. The health ministry official Achmad Yurianto also reported 24 new deaths attributed to the disease, taking the total to 420, and said Indonesia had performed 42,000 tests for the virus. CNN Indonesia has been streaming the briefing here. Indonesia\u2019s government has been accused of failing to act quickly, after initially downplaying the threat of the virus in the country. It wasn\u2019t until 2 March that a first case was confirmed in Indonesia, prompting fears that the virus may have been left to spread, especially in the country\u2019s densely populated capital. The world\u2019s biggest trial of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients has been set up in the UK at unprecedented speed, and hopes to have some answers within weeks. The Recovery trial has recruited more than 5,000 patients in 165 NHS hospitals around the UK in a month, ahead of similar trials in the US and Europe, which have a few hundred. \u201cThis is by far the largest trial in the world,\u201d said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, who is leading it. He has previously led Ebola drug trials in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Recovery team expects to be the first to have definitive data. \u201cWe\u2019re guessing some time in June we may get the results,\u201d said Horby. \u201cIf it is really clear that there are benefits, an answer will be available quicker.\u201d But he warned that in the case of Covid-19, there would be no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d. On the stock markets, European shares have been clawing back weekly declines as financial markets globally drew comfort from Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a gradual re-opening of the US economy and reports of a potential drug to treat Covid-19. Lifting the mood was a report detailing encouraging partial data from trials of the US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s experimental drug remdesivir in severe Covid-19 patients. \u201cIf proven effective, remdesivir would be a game-changer in the Covid-19 pandemic fight, especially being a legacy drug that has been around for many years,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, a market analyst at the exchange company OANDA. Our business blog has those developments and more here. Ireland has contained and effectively suppressed coronavirus in the population at large, a tribute to early and successful action by authorities and the public. The bad news is the pandemic continues to wreak havoc in care homes, which account for more than 300 of the 486 recorded deaths. \u201cThe data clearly shows that there are two very different experiences of Covid-19 in Ireland today,\u201d the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, told a media briefing. The daily number of deaths nationwide reached a new high of 43 on Thursday but the number of new cases of Covid-19 has plateaued and should soon fall, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team. Since 3 April the growth rate in new cases has been close to zero and the number in intensive care units has stabilised. The reproduction number of the disease is now estimated at 0.7 to 1, a steep fall from the outset of the pandemic when an infected person infected around 4.5 other people. However almost one-third of nursing homes have the Covid-19 virus, according to the Health Information and Quality Authority. Some experts are calling it a catastrophe. Separately, there is concern that earlier this week almost 200 fruit pickers flew from Bulgaria to Dublin on a Ryanair flight that allegedly lacked social distancing measures on board. Irish media cited a letter purporting to be from a Ryanair employee which said the chartered flight had put cabin crew at risk. Some politicians complained, saying it made no sense to import seasonal workers in the teeth of a pandemic when people in Ireland could not travel more than 2km from home. Hundreds of foreign-born doctors, including refugees, have signed up to become medical support workers as part of a new scheme aimed at helping the UK\u2019s National Health Service tackle the coronavirus pandemic. NHS England launched the initiative for international medical graduates and doctors after calls to fast track the accreditation of overseas medics. The NHS plans to deploy the workers, who have passed an English language exam, in small numbers initially. The UN\u2019s refugee chief this week called for more countries to allow refugee medical professionals to tackle the health crisis. Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, has praised the \u201cselfless determination\u201d of medical professionals who have already responded. The Afghan government is seeking more foreign aid to fight coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases reached 906 amid a surge of infections in Kandahar and Helmand. Some 66 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours, health ministry officials said. Of the new cases, 26 were recorded in the capital city, Kabul, which is under a lockdown. The government extended the Kabul lockdown on Thursday for three more weeks and warned of more severe restrictions on movements. Russia has reported 4,069 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, up from 3,448 on the previous day, according to the Moscow-based Interfax news agency. On Tuesday Vladimir Putin warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak. On Monday, the overall nationwide tally stood at 18,328 and the death toll was 148 as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow. The UN refugee agency is to give cash donations to 110,000 families in Iraq to help buy basic hygiene items that it hopes will slow the spread of Covid-19 among refugee communities. UNHCR says the handouts could reach as many as 550,000 people across the country, where several million people remain displaced after 17 years of war, insurrection and widespread state graft. First payments were made on Wednesday. \u201cDuring these difficult times, we must support those who were forced to flee their homes,\u201d said Philippa Candler, acting representative of UNHCR in Iraq. \u201cLike all of us, they are worried for their families and for themselves, but they don\u2019t have the necessary means to protect themselves. Cash will help them buy basic hygiene items, which is an essential preventive measure.\u201d The threat posed by coronavirus if it enters the region\u2019s refugee or internally displaced populations is being seen as an extreme public health emergency \u2013 which could dwarf the impact of the virus on the developed world. Across Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, as many as 10 million refugees have crossed borders fleeing war or persecution. In Syria alone, at least 6 million people are thought to remain internally displaced. China\u2019s foreign ministry has been defending the state\u2019s approach after Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce revised the death toll in the Chinese city upwards by 50% \u2013 from 2,579 to 3,869. The ministry said authorities had conducted a \u201cstatistical verification\u201d of its Covid-19 toll to ensure accuracy in what it said was a common international practice, Reuters reports. There had never been a cover-up of the figures around the outbreak, the ministry added. Citing the number of patients who had died at home before reaching hospital, as well as late and inaccurate reporting, Wuhan\u2019s taskforce on virus prevention and control had said earlier: \u201cEvery loss of life during the epidemic is not just a source of sorrow for their family, but for the city as well. We would like to send our sincere sympathies to the family members.\u201d Myanmar has announced that it is releasing almost 25,000 prisoners under a presidential amnesty marking this week\u2019s traditional new year celebration. The release for the Thingyan holiday was announced in a statement from President Win Myint\u2019s office. Mass amnesties on the holiday are not unusual, though the number this year was the highest in recent memory. The president\u2019s statement did not say if the release was related to calls to free them because of the hazard of contracting Covid-19 in the close quarters of prison. Senior figures from the Scottish National party, which heads the devolved government based in Edinburgh, have said they won\u2019t shy away from taking a different path to the rest of the UK if necessary. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIf I was being advised and the judgment I was applying to that advice told me that I had to do something different to the rest of the UK because it was right and necessary to control the virus in Scotland, of course I would do that, but I will be driven by what advice science and my own judgment are telling me the right thing to do is.\u201d The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said earlier: \u201cOf course we took action when we considered it appropriate to close schools in Scotland. So there are powers the first minister, the government and the parliament in Edinburgh has and they will use those powers in the interest of the people of Scotland. \u201cThat\u2019s only right and proper that we do that, but we\u2019ll seek to work collectively with the government in London.\u201d An organisation founded by the philanthropist George Soros has said it is to give more than $130m to combat Covid-19, with a focus on providing immediate relief for vulnerable communities and pushing back against what it described as government encroachment on political freedoms. Cities including New York, London and Berlin will receive the funding, as well as Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Amman and Cape Town, according to the Open Societies Foundation. Soros said: \u201cThe scale of this pandemic has laid bare the faultlines and injustices of our world. \u201cWe missed the opportunity to create a more just economy after the financial crisis of 2008 and provide a social safety net for the workers who are the heart of our societies. Today, we must change direction and ask ourselves: what kind of world will emerge from this catastrophe, and what can we do to make it a better one?\u201d Parts of the package include: Nearly $42m to support low-income workers, including in the informal sector, care-givers, and undocumented refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. $37m for initiatives to support workers and their families in New York City, home to Open Society\u2019s largest office. $3m for Europe, including both London and Berlin, for local groups countering disinformation and helping vulnerable people, such as senior citizens. Japan has started distributing reusable cloth face masks dubbed \u201cAbenomasks\u201d after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose decision to issue two per household has been met with mockery by some. Abe announced the measure on 1 April as part of a wider package of emergency policies to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, saying the delivery of cloth masks would help ease a nationwide shortage. The decision attracted ridicule, particularly given the scanty size of the coverings. They sit over a much smaller portion of the face than the disposable surgical masks that have become ubiquitous in Japan in recent months. The cloth coverings have become widely referred to as \u201cAbenomasks\u201d, meaning \u201cAbe\u2019s masks\u201d and a play on the prime minister\u2019s much-touted \u201cAbenomics\u201d economic programme. About 50m households across the country will receive two masks each, delivered by Japan Post, the AFP news agency reported. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has reiterated his calls for face masks to be worn as the UK is \u201cbeing an outlier\u201d in not following the policy. \u201cI think their advice should change and the government\u2019s advice should change so that in those circumstances where it is not possible for us to keep our social distance \u2013 think of public transport usage, think of when you\u2019re in a shop \u2013 we should be using non-medical facial coverings like bandanas, like scarves, like reusable masks,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He added: \u201cThe evidence I\u2019ve seen is if you wear a non-medical facial covering it doesn\u2019t necessarily limit your changes of catching the virus. What it does do, if you yourself are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, it reduces the chances of you giving the virus to somebody else.\u201d A coronavirus contact-tracing app will be ready for Germans to download and use on their smartphones in three to four weeks, the health minister, Jens Spahn, has said. German federal and state government leaders said on Wednesday they would support voluntary use of a contact-tracing app, when available, so people can quickly learn when they have been exposed to an infected person. Developers are working hard on an app to make sure data protection standards are \u201cas perfect as possible\u201d, Spahn told the broadcaster ARD. \u201cFor it to be really good, it needs more like three to four weeks rather than two weeks,\u201d Spahn said. In relation to that last post, the UK\u2019s government has been accused of being too slow to enlist British textile firms to make protective gear for the NHS, according to industry figures, who say they have been desperate to contribute to the \u201cwar effort\u201d. Faced with a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the Cabinet Office has only recently begun scrambling to source it from UK suppliers and has now outsourced the process to consultants from the accountancy group Deloitte, reports the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies. But industry figures said too much emphasis had been placed on high-profile names such as Burberry, the luxury fashion house that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on 3 April was producing medical gowns. Kate Hills, the founder of Make It British, which promotes brands that manufacture in the UK, said the government was ignoring less-well-known textile specialists in favour of household names that played well with the public. \u201cThey\u2019re just picking out brand names,\u201d she said. The head of an NHS trust \u2013 one of the organisational units within the UK\u2019s National Health Service \u2013 has asked for the help of a British fashion company as he fears his staff will soon run out of hospital gowns. The man, who wished to remain anonymous and was reported to be from a trust in southern England, phoned the BBC\u2019s business reporter Simon Browning and asked for the factory phone number of Burberry, which has turned over its production to make PPE for healthcare workers. As reported on BBC Radio 4, the man said his staff will run out of gowns this weekend and described health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s denial of a PPE shortage across the UK as a \u201cfantasy\u201d. Burberry is among a list of labels including Barbour, Louis Vuitton and Philip Treacy to have pledged to manufacture equipment crucial to fighting Covid-19. As people in the UK awake to morning bulletins and front pages reporting that the lockdown in the country could last into June, the government\u2019s strategy will face scrutiny last this morning when MPs question the health minister, Matt Hancock. That hearing - in which the health committee chaired by a predecessor of Hancock, Jeremy Hunt - is due to take place at 10.30 (UK time). We\u2019ll be covering it on our UK blog which will be up and running in a while. This is Ben Quinn in London manning the global blog, which will bring you coverage of developments around the world, as well as highlights from the UK. The healthcare system in Belarus is being propped up by volunteers and crowdfunding campaigns as the country grapples with a coronavirus pandemic its president has been hesitant to admit exists. Belarus has attracted international headlines for its delayed response, continuing to host Europe\u2019s only active football league, as the president, Alexander Lukashenko, dismissed the pandemic as a \u201cpsychosis\u201d. \u201cNo one in the country will die from coronavirus,\u201d Lukashenko declared publicly earlier this week. Meanwhile, a human rights activist and volunteer worker, Andrej Stryzhak, has cofounded the #bycovid19 group to crowdfund, acquire and deliver equipment and protective clothing to medics and other frontline personnel, one of many local initiatives by NGOs and businesses. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Ben Quinn is here to take you through the day\u2019s coronavirus pandemic news. Today\u2019s sign off, in the spirit of living our weekends vicariously through others, celebrates these sleepy \u2013 and decidedly non socially-distanced \u2013 lions: And these well-travelled crabs: Coronavirus latest: at a glance A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. Here are a few of the UK front pages for Friday 17 April 2020: Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minister has been tested for Covid-19 after he was exposed to the virus by a customs agent. Dickson Sorariba reports from Port Moresby: James Marape is among a number of officials leading the country\u2019s response to coronavirus who was tested. Their samples have been flown to the Australian city of Brisbane, with results expected by Friday afternoon. The National Operations Centre, which is the country\u2019s nerve centre for the fight against the spread of the virus, is under lockdown and surrounded by security. Staff have been instructed to self isolate at home. The functions of NOC have been moved to an alternative location. On Friday the state of emergency controller, David Manning, issued new emergency directives to contain the virus. They include: an 8pm-6am curfew, a ban on all public gatherings and public transport, and an outright liquor ban. The new orders cover the nation\u2019s capital, Port Morseby and two neighbouring provinces, Central and Western. Western province, which shares the border with Indonesia, has recorded three cases among the traditional border crossers. You can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Singapore\u2019s cramped migrant worker dorms hide Covid-19 surge risk Singapore, praised for its gold standard approach to tracing coronavirus cases, is facing a surge in transmission linked to its cramped migrant workers\u2019 dormitories, where thousands more infections are expected to emerge. The health ministry reported 728 new cases on Thursday, the biggest rise in a single day, as medical teams raced to test and isolate workers living in vast dormitory blocks. While Singapore has been lauded for its rapid and comprehensive approach to contract tracing, officials have been accused of overlooking the dormitories, where thousands of workers live in close quarters and between 12 and 20 men might share a single room. In March the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) urged officials to make plans to protect workers, warning: \u201cThe risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable.\u201d Authorities are resorting to moving men to multi-storey car parks, military camps and floating hotels in an attempt to reduce crowding. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, more than 145,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. The sombre milestone comes as Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce revised the death toll in Wuhan upwards by 50%, from 2,579 to 3,869. The global case count passed 2.1 million on Friday, with 2,158,033 confirmed infections. The ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins, are as follows: US: 667,225 (33,286 deaths) Spain: 184,948 (19,315 deaths) Italy: 168,941 (22,170 deaths) France: 147,091 (17,941 deaths) Germany: 137,698 (4,052 deaths) United Kingdom: 104,145 (13,759 deaths) China: 83,403 (4,636 deaths) Iran: 77,995 (4,869 deaths) Turkey: 74,193 (1,643 deaths) Belgium: 34,809 (4,857 deaths) China economy shrinks for first time as Wuhan Covid-19 death toll is increased by 1,300 China\u2019s economy shrank 6.8% in the three months of 2020, the country\u2019s first such contraction on record and a stark sign of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The news came as Chinese authorities revised the death toll in Wuhan, the hardest hit city and where the virus first emerged, up by 50%, to 3,869 from 2,579. Citing the number of patients who had died at home before reaching hospital, as well as late and inaccurate reporting, the city\u2019s task force on virus prevention and control said: \u201cEvery loss of life during the epidemic is not just a source of sorrow for their family, but for the city as well. We would like to send our sincere sympathies to the family members.\u201d The economic contraction, reported by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics on Friday, comes after months of paralysis as the country went into lockdown to contain the virus, which emerged in central Hubei province in December. It has now infected more than 2 million people globally and killed more than 140,000. More than a quarter of Myanmar\u2019s prison population is to be released, the president\u2019s office announced Friday, as calls grow to ease pressure on overcrowded jails with coronavirus fears gripping the country. The Southeast Asian nation grants an annual amnesty to thousands of prisoners to mark its April New Year holiday, but this is the largest ever recorded. So far Myanmar has officially confirmed 85 cases of Covid-19, including four deaths, but experts fear the real number is many times more due to the low numbers tested. The country is under a nationwide lockdown and there has been growing pressure to release inmates from what Human Rights Watch (HRW) calls \u201chorribly overcrowded and unsanitary\u201d jails. The release would start immediately, a senior officer of the prison department in Myanmar\u2019s capital Naypyidaw told AFP without giving further details. Global coronavirus cases pass 2.1 million. The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,158,250, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April. Deaths have passed 144,000. Wuhan death toll revised up 50%. Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce have revised the death toll in Wuhan upwards by 50%, from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported death toll, as other countries have seen fatalities reach more than 10,000. China\u2019s GDP shrinks 6.8% in March quarter. China has reported its first ever quarterly contraction at 6.8%, its slowest pace on record. China\u2019s economy has not recorded a contraction since 1992 when the country began publishing quarterly GDP data. In 2019, China already posted its slowest growth in almost 30 years. Human Rights Watch warns of \u201ctremendous danger\u201d of virus resurgence in China, due to Beijing\u2019s censorship and suppression during the coronavirus outbreak. US president Donald Trump has issued guidelines for reopening the country, with three phases each dependent on states meeting certain criteria. Trump says states who meet Phase 1 criteria can reopen tomorrow (on Friday), and that 29 states will reopen \u201crelatively soon\u201d. IMF predicts zero growth in Latin America and the Caribbean for decade to 2025. The International Monetary Fund on Thursday said the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, combined with other problems in recent years, meant Latin America and the Caribbean would likely see \u201cno growth\u201d in the decade from 2015 to 2025. UN warns pandemic turning into a \u2018child-rights crisis\u2019. The social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is potentially catastrophic for millions of children, according to a UN report launched Thursday. It said Covid-19 is turning into a broader child-rights crisis. The UK government announces lockdown extension for three weeks. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies. India brings culpable homicide charges against Muslim seminary chief, for holding a gathering last month that authorities blame for a big jump in coronavirus infections, police said on Thursday. 5 million more Americans sign on as unemployed. The US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March. New Zealand has recorded its lowest new coronavirus cases, with 8 people found to be infected after 4241 tests were conducted in a single day, including at a random testing station set up outside a supermarket in the resort town of Queenstown. Japan declares nationwide state of emergency. Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country. A third Japanese cabinet official has also tested positive for the virus. Quartz writes of the revised Wuhan figures: Many people, including Wuhan residents, have long been skeptical of the city\u2019s low official death toll. Evidence of government cover-ups is rife, from the silencing of initial whistleblowers to the revelation that state leaders hushed up the crisis for at least six crucial days, so distrust of official tallies runs deep. Extrapolating from their experiences of long lines at city hospitals and being turned away when seeking medical care, Wuhan residents have spoken openly about their belief that the real case count and the death toll must be higher than currently reported. Here is some of our earlier reporting on Wuhan: Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce have revised the death toll in Wuhan upwards by 50%, from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported death toll, as other countries have seen fatalities reach more than 10,000. The agency said reasons for the change included adding the number of patients unable to reach hospitals, late, mistaken or double reporting, as well as difficulty linking information reported from private hospitals, temporary hospitals and other medical institutions that handled patients. \u201cLife and the people are paramount. Every loss of life during the epidemic is not just a source of sorrow for their family, but the city as well. We would like to send our sincere sympathies to the family members of those who died during the epidemic, as well as our comrades and medical staff who sacrificed their lives,\u201d it said. India has banned the use of video-conferencing app Zoom for government remote meetings, the government said Thursday, in the latest warning about the platform\u2019s security, The app has become the global go-to service for everything from education to exercise classes as millions stay home. \u201cThis advisory states that the platform is not for use by government officers/officials for official purposes,\u201d the Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement Thursday, referring to the guidelines it had issued Sunday. \u201cZoom is not a safe platform,\u201d the statement said. Last week Taiwan advised government agencies against using videoconferencing apps with security concerns, such as Zoom. And Singapore on Tuesday allowed teachers to resume using Zoom after suspending it last week, when gatecrashers interrupted a class and made lewd comments. Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States will again be temporarily suspended, Guatemala\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday, after a mass infection of the new coronavirus was reported on a recent flight. The Associated Press reported 44 of 76 Guatemalan migrants who arrived in the country on a US deportation flight on Monday subsequently tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus that causes a respiratory illness. When contacted by Reuters, the government did not immediately confirm the report, which cited an unnamed Guatemalan official. A spokesman for the foreign ministry confirmed deportation flights have been temporarily suspended but gave no further details. Later on Thursday, a spokesman for the presidency said Guatemala would test deportees again regardless of whether they had been tested before. Deportation flights had only started again on Monday after a five-day suspension. The health ministry says that in total, five deportees have tested positive for the virus since March. The IMF on Thursday approved nearly $1.4bn in emergency aid to Pakistan to help it weather the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Pakistan has recorded just over 100 deaths and 6,919 cases, but experts have voiced fear that the country of 215 million people could see a rapid and devastating increase due to its shortage of medical infrastructure and crowded cities. Worried about hurting an already weak economy, Prime Minister Imran Khan has resisted a sweeping, nationwide lockdown but provinces have shuttered schools and companies. The IMF said it was providing the $1.386 billion under a so-called rapid financing instrument, which addresses emergencies and does not subject a country to a full-fledged reform program that undergoes review. Pakistan is a longtime recipient of help from the IMF and is already under a three-year, $6bn program that was approved last year. Okamoto said Pakistan needed to recommit to its goals under the package once the crisis abates, including restoring its public finances and governance. As we scuttle along to the weekend: Podcast: The story of one care home hit by coronavirus Julie Roche is a manager of a Buckinghamshire care home that usually has 45 residents. In the past few weeks she has lost 13 patients to Covid-19. She discusses the devastating impact this has had on families, staff and her remaining residents. The social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is potentially catastrophic for millions of children, according to a UN report launched Thursday. It said Covid-19 is turning into a broader child-rights crisis, AP reports. In a video statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pointed to almost all students out of school, family stress levels rising as communities face lock-downs, and reduced household income expected to force poor families to cut back on essential health and food expenditures, particularly affecting children. Guterres said the global recession that is gathering pace as a result of the pandemic and the measures being taken to mitigate it could lead to hundreds of thousands additional child deaths in 2020. According to the report, this would effectively reverse the last two to three years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year. The estimate of hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths came from a 2011 paper by three economists Sarah Baird, Jed Friedman, and Norbert Schady who investigated the impact of income shocks, like a recession, on infant mortality. Trump\u2019s \u2018science based\u2019 reopening strategy is still full of unanswered questions On Thursday Donald Trump unveiled federal staggered guidelines for getting America back to business after the shutdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic. He had previously billed it as the most important decision of his presidency, but what he called \u201ca science-based reopening\u201d was messier and more ill-defined. First, the good news. The 18-page document explicitly used the word \u201cguidelines\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the \u201ctotal authority\u201d he claimed earlier this week. It delegates authority to state governors and city mayors to weigh the risk-to-reward ratio of opening businesses, churches and schools, which is the way it should be. It also recognises the need to move gradually with baby steps, and the fact that America is vast \u2013 roughly the same size as Europe \u2013 with different needs in different places. But there are plenty of ambiguities. The guidelines do not give a firm target date. Trump said some states could reopen \u201ctomorrow\u201d but declined to name them. The guidelines emphasise the need for testing but do not make clear how many tests will be enough, nor set out a national testing strategy. Yet testing and contact tracing have been key to the relative success of countries such as Germany and South Korea. You can\u2019t leave that lion there: big cats nap on road in South Africa amid lockdown Lions and other wild animals have been taking advantage of the peace and quiet in South Africa\u2019s vast Kruger national park as the country\u2019s strict lockdown continues. On Thursday, park ranger Richard Sowry took photographs of a pride of at least eight lions, including a few young cubs, snoozing on the tarmac just outside one of the park\u2019s rest lodges. Kruger media officer Isaac Phaala told the BBC the lions would normally be in the bushes but that they were \u201cvery smart and now they are enjoying the freedom of the park without us\u201d. In Australia, 30 people at the Anglicare Newmarch House aged care facility in New South Wales have tested positive for Covid-19, a doubling in the number of cases associated with the facility overnight. On Friday morning an Anglicare spokesman said 10 staff and 20 residents at the western Sydney facility had the virus, a marked increase from the six staff and nine residents diagnosed on Thursday. An outbreak occurred in the home after a nurse worked for six days without knowing she had the virus, as she had only mild symptoms of a sore throat and running nose. Currently the federal government advice is that health and aged care workers can be tested if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms specifically. This guidance is the same for NSW. New Zealand has recorded its lowest ever number of new coronaviruses with 8 people found to be infected after 4241 tests were conducted in a single day, including at a random testing station set up outside a supermarket in the resort town of Queenstown. There are just 4 days of level four lockdown left, with the prime minister set to announce the country\u2019s next move - remaining at 4 or lowering to 3, allowing slightly fewer restrictions - on Monday. Finance minister Grant Roberston said many countries were choosing to extend their lockdowns - including the UK and France - but this should not be taken as an indication of what decision cabinet would make on Monday. \u201cThis is a long game - a marathon, not a short sprint,\u201d Robertson said. Staying in the region for now, Japan\u2019s cabinet said on Friday an official had tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the third case among officials at the cabinet office. The case inside the cabinet office comes as Japan has expanded a state of emergency to all regions. The move allows local municipalities to urge people to stay inside, but without punitive measures or legal force. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans a press conference later on Friday on the coronavirus, but details are not known yet. Abe said on Thursday the government is considering cash payouts for all in an effort to cushion the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The infected cabinet official in his 50s, but had no close contact with ministers around when he developed symptoms from April 10, an official at the cabinet office said. More now on the new figures for China: Industrial output fell a less steeper-than-expected 1.1% in March from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday, as the coronavirus crisis and strict containment measures severely disrupted the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected industrial output to fall by 7.3% in March, moderating somewhat after plunging 13.5% in the first two months of the year. China has reported its first ever quarterly contraction at 6.8%, its slowest pace on record. The decline comes after almost three months of nationwide lockdown as the country battled the coronavirus, which emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has infected more than 2 million people around the world. China\u2019s economy has not recorded a contraction since 1992 when the country began publishing quarterly GDP data. In 2019, China already posted its slowest growth in almost 30 years. Over the last month, Chinese authorities have pushed to get the paralysed economy back up and running with businesses and factories re-opening and policies to help households and companies. Analysts polled by Reuters estimate China\u2019s yearly growth for 2020 will slow to 2.5% from 6.1% last year, the weakest pace since the last year of the Cultural Revolution. China has reported more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections from the coronavirus At 8pm on Thursday, people across the UK stood at their front doors and open windows, in gardens and on balconies, to raise a thunder of gratitude for those working on the frontline against coronavirus for the fourth consecutive week. Some people played instruments and sang to show their appreciation: You can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Trump defers to governors in guidelines for reopening US amid pandemic Donald Trump and his coronavirus taskforce have unveiled a set of federal guidelines for reopening the economy, which comprise three phases but ultimately defer to governors on when and how to return their state to normal. The first phase allows for gradually returning to work while also minimizing non-essential travel. The second phase would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel. The third allows for schools and organized youth activities to open up as well as large venues to operate under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d. The third phase would also allow bars to reopen but with \u201cdiminished standing room occupancy\u201d when possible. The guidelines were unveiled at the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday. They represent a dramatic shift from the strict stay-at-home orders currently in place in many states. In unveiling them Trump made clear his eagerness to end the nationwide lockdown and return the American economy to its pre-coronavirus days. Mexico will begin to restrict movement between places most affected by the Covid-19 virus mostly large cities and places with few infections, the president said Thursday. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador asked authorities Thursday in towns so far unaffected by the pandemic to help us establish sanitary cordons to slow the spread. Travel between low-infection and high-infection areas would be permitted for \u201curgent, justifiable\u201d reasons, but authorities would likely set up highway checkpoints to check travellers for symptoms. In the past, that has mainly meant taking their temperatures. However, L\u00f3pez-Gatell said the exact measures were still to be defined. He said coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about one-fifth of Mexicos roughly 2,470 townships and municipalities. The government is also extending its social distancing measures for another month to the end of May, predicting that the epidemic will peak in Mexico in about three weeks. Mexico has confirmed nearly 6,300 infections and reported about 485 deaths. L\u00f3pez-Gatell said health officials believe the real number of infections is probably eight times that. On Thursday he presented lists saying the country had nearly 56,000 estimated cases, though most remain untested. Mexico is currently running only about 4,000 tests per week, and has completed only about 21,250 tests so far. Ten US nurses have been suspended for refusing to work without N95 masks, AP reports. Nurses in Santa Monica, California, who refused to care for Covid-19 patients after they say hospital didn\u2019t provide essential protective gear have been suspended. The hospital suspended ten nurses, according to the National Nurses United, which represents them. The nurses are now being paid but are not allowed to return to work pending an investigation from human resources, the union said. They are among hundreds of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers across the country who say they\u2019ve been asked to work without adequate protection. Some have taken part in protests or lodged formal complaints. Others are buying or even making their own supplies. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don\u2019t require N95 masks for Covid-19 caregivers, but many hospitals are opting for the added protection because the infection is extremely contagious. The CDC said Wednesday at least 9,200 healthcare workers have been infected. As South Africa\u2019s lockdown continues, animals in the vast Kruger National Park are taking advantage of the peace and quiet. On Monday, lions were spotted romping on the golf course inside the park: Later in the week, ranger Richard Sowry took photographs of a pride sleeping just outside one of the rest camps. Kruger media officer Isaac Phaala told the BBC the lions would normally be in the bushes but that they were \u201cvery smart and now they are enjoying the freedom of the park without us.\u201d The lions liked the road as it was dry, Phaala said. \u201cThe tar was drier than the grass at the time - big cats and water don\u2019t mix.\u201d Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan handed out meals to sick people in Los Angeles, in their first known public activity since moving to California at the start of the state\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. The pair, who have formally stepped down as senior members of the British royal family, first volunteered with Project Angel Food last Sunday, delivering food to homes. Project Angel Food delivers medically tailored food to chronically ill people and appears to be the first charity publicly supported by the pair since their secretive move. \u201cThey were here Easter Sunday, and then they surprised us on Wednesday,\u201d said Project Angel Food communications manager Anne-Marie Williams. \u201cThey handed out to 20 of our clients, and they rocked their worlds.\u201d A statement from the nonprofit said the pair \u201cquietly continued delivering meals to relieve our overworked drivers,\u201d who have faced an increased workload since the coronavirus lockdown began last month. The couple relocated to California last month after announcing in January that they intended to quit royal life and \u201cwork to become financially independent\u201d. They have kept a low profile, with even their location unknown amid unconfirmed reports that the pair are living in Malibu. It emerged last week that they are planning to launch a wide-ranging non-profit organization in the United States named Archewell. It will include emotional support groups, a multimedia educational empire and a wellbeing website. India has brought charges of culpable homicide against the chief of a Muslim seminary for holding a gathering last month that authorities blame for a big jump in coronavirus infections, police said on Thursday. The headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat group in a cramped corner of New Delhi were sealed and thousands of followers, including some from Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh, were taken into quarantine after it emerged they had attended meetings there in mid-March. Authorities have said some of those infected at the gathering had died, although the numbers have not yet been released. Police initially filed a case against Muhammad Saad Kandhalvi, the chief of the centre, for violating a ban on big gatherings but had now invoked the law against culpable homicide, a police spokesman said. The Tablighi is one of the world\u2019s biggest Sunni Muslim proselytising organisations with followers in more than 80 countries, promoting a pure form of Islam. India has 12,759 cases of coronavirus and 420 deaths. In New Delhi, 1,080 of its 1,561 cases were linked to the group\u2019s gathering, according to the city government data on Wednesday. More now from Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth: He says some governments were using the pandemic as an \u201copportunity for brutality\u201d, citing Uganda, Kenya and El Salvador while other leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had been using the virus as a pretext for power-grabs. Meanwhile, a denialist approach from US President Donald Trump and his Mexican and Brazilian counterparts would prove costly. Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo-week delay in recognising the severity of the pandemic probably caused 90% of the deaths so far in the United States,\u201d said Roth. Roth said the response to the crisis echoed that of the September 2001 terror attacks when \u201cgovernments seized that opportunity to over-react\u201d with highly intrusive surveillance. \u201cThe fear is that this kind of over-reach is happening again,\u201d and \u201cis going to be with us for a long time\u201d. There is a \u201ctremendous danger\u201d of a Covid-19 resurgence in China due to Beijing\u2019s censorship and suppression during the coronavirus outbreak, Human Rights Watch warned on Thursday. Meanwhile the \u201cculture of denialism\u201d among the leaders of the United States, Mexico and Brazil was costing lives, HRW executive director Kenneth Roth told reporters in Geneva via a virtual press conference. The non-governmental organisation\u2019s chief said China was the \u201cmost notorious abuser\u201d when it came to exploiting the pandemic to indulge in censorship. He said Beijing had allowed the virus to spread by having \u201ccensored and suppressed the Wuhan doctors\u201d who first tried to warn of the outbreak there in December. \u201cThat\u2019s a classic example of how censorship is disastrous,\u201d said Roth. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous danger that censorship is going to permit the virus to reactivate,\u201d he added. President Xi Jinping \u201chas almost staked his personal prestige on saying there is no more human to human transmission within China\u201d, said Roth. \u201cThat message from Beijing that we don\u2019t want accurate information but good news only is a recipe for the coronavirus\u2019s re-emergence.\u201d Apple Inc said on Thursday it would reopen its sole retail store in South Korea on 18 April, marking it the first site to return to business after it closed all stores outside Greater China last month due to the coronavirus outbreak. Once struggling with the first large outbreak outside China, South Korea has largely managed to bring its coronavirus cases under control without major disruptions thanks to a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing. The iPhone maker reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China in March, more than a month after they were shut in the wake of the pandemic. Apple\u2019s plan of reopening the store in Seoul comes a day after it released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the Covid-19 pandemic hobbles the global economy. New York state will extend its stay-at-home restrictions at least through 15 May, amid signs the initial wave of the coronavirus outbreak has stopped getting worse. Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that virus transmission rates still need to be tamed as he prolonged rules that have left many New Yorkers working from home, or out of a job entirely, and unable to gather in public since 22 March. The governor said the extension was made in consultation with other Northeast states and will be re-evaluated next month. The number of people hospitalised statewide has ticked down to under 18,000 \u2013 far below initial projections. But there are still close to 2,000 newly diagnosed people coming into hospitals daily, Cuomo said. New York recorded 606 Covid-19-related deaths Wednesday, the lowest daily number in more than a week. More than 12,000 people have died statewide in just over a month. The governor also said he\u2019s expanding the requirement starting Friday night that all residents wear face coverings when theyre out in public and within 6 feet of other people. He said that in addition to being required on subways and buses, coverings must be worn by drivers and passengers in for-hire vehicles. New York City meanwhile is getting ready to use 11,000 empty hotel rooms for coronavirus quarantines. Mayor Bill de Blasio also said the city is grappling with a projected $7.4bn loss in tax revenue because of the crisis. The Trump administration has issued new guidelines for states, individuals and employers on how to gradually revive activity and ease up on social distancing in areas where coronavirus cases are on the decline. The guidelines, distributed to governors Thursday, are published under the headline Opening Up America Again. They follow concerns voiced by President Donald Trump about the need to get more people back to work and shopping, as 22 million Americans lose their jobs. Here is what needs to happen before states can enter Phase 1: A decline of documented Covid-19 cases within a 14-day period A robust testing program in place for at-risk health care workers A decline of influenza-like illnesses reported within a 14-day period Hospitals having enough protective gear for their workers and enough beds, ventilators and other needed supplies to treat all patients. The International Monetary Fund on Thursday said the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, combined with other problems in recent years, meant Latin America and the Caribbean would likely see \u201cno growth\u201d in the decade from 2015 to 2025. Alejandro Werner, who heads the IMF\u2019s Western Hemisphere department, said the global lender was racing to process 16 requests for emergency assistance, about half of which were from Caribbean nations devastated by a halt in tourism. Other countries had asked about traditional IMF programs or extensions of existing financing arrangements, he said. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus live blog with me, Helen Sullivan. The White House has issued \u201cGuidelines for Opening Up America Again\u201d, which includes three phases of reopening each dependent on infections within a state. Trump said 29 states will be able to start reopening soon \u2013 and that those who meet the requirements for Phase 1 will be able to do so as soon as Friday. Elsewhere, Japan has extended its state of emergency to the entire country; the UK has extended its lockdown by three weeks; and Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has fired his health minister. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Global coronavirus cases pass 2.1 million. The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,138,763, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April. Deaths have passed 142,000. US president Donald Trump has issued guidelines for reopening the country, with three phases each dependent on states meeting certain criteria. Trump says states who meet Phase 1 criteria can reopen tomorrow (on Friday), and that 29 states will reopen \u201crelatively soon\u201d. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has sacks his popular health minister Luiz Mandetta, after a weeks-long stand-off between the two men over radically different views of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK government announces lockdown extension for three weeks. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies. 5 million more Americans sign on as unemployed. The US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March. The largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992, when 2.7 million sought support. France registered 753 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Thursday, bringing the total to 17,920, the fourth highest tally in the world. But the number of people in hospital has declined for a second day running. Australia PM says more Covid-19 measures needed. Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, said the country had succeeding in flattening the infection curve but that a \u201cmore extensive surveillance regime\u201d needed to be implemented if they were to forge \u201cthe road out\u201d of lockdown. EU chief: \u2018Europe owes Italy an apology\u2019. Europe owes Italy \u201ca heartfelt apology\u201d for not offering assistance when the country was suffering in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of the European Union executive said. New York State lockdown extended to 15 May. Governor Andrew Cuomo also announced that starting on Friday, anyone aged two and older would be required to wear face coverings in public. Another 606 people have died from the virus in New York, the lowest figure in 10 days, bringing the total above 12,000 in the state. IMF: Asian economies will not grow this year. Economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years, the International Monetary Fund has said. Singapore reports biggest jump yet in cases. Singapore reported at least 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city-state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control. Japan declares nationwide state of emergency. Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country. According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.

But the coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, admitted that phase two remained uncertain because of the difficulty of testing people who carry the virus but do not show symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cOur best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening if state governors should choose to do that,\u201d Pence told reporters in a lengthy briefing dominated by the issue.</p> <p>Dr Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, added that the US would need to conduct about 4.5m tests each month to safely enter phase one. It is currently carrying out about 1m to 1.2m a week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">Antibody study suggests coronavirus is far more widespread than previously thought</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In phase one, the guidelines recommend strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings bigger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged. In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume.</p> <p>When Birx was asked whether testing capacity was sufficient for phase two, she replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question, and what we will be doing is monitoring how much we have to use in phase one to really help inform phase two.\u201d</p> <p>She admitted: \u201cThe real unknown in this, to be completely transparent, is asymptomatic and asymptomatic spread, and so if we find that there\u2019s a lot of asymptomatic individuals that we find in this active monitoring in what we are very much concerned about, the most vulnerable, then we will have to have increased testing to cover all of those sites.\u201d</p> <p>Pence also emphasised that states, not the federal government, would have to take responsibility for testing programmes. The absence of a national testing strategy is seen by critics as an attempt by the White House to avoid blame if problems arise.</p> <p>Pence said: \u201cAs the president\u2019s made clear, we want governors and states to manage the testing operations in their states.

      "bodyText": "The White House coronavirus taskforce has pushed back at widespread criticism that the US lacks the testing capacity to end lockdowns and reopen its economy. Mike Pence, the vice-president, insisted on Friday that there were enough tests to enable states to follow the first phase of federal guidelines released 24 hours earlier. But the coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, admitted that phase two remained uncertain because of the difficulty of testing people who carry the virus but do not show symptoms. \u201cOur best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening if state governors should choose to do that,\u201d Pence told reporters in a lengthy briefing dominated by the issue. Dr Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, added that the US would need to conduct about 4.5m tests each month to safely enter phase one. It is currently carrying out about 1m to 1.2m a week. In phase one, the guidelines recommend strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings bigger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged. In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume. When Birx was asked whether testing capacity was sufficient for phase two, she replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a great question, and what we will be doing is monitoring how much we have to use in phase one to really help inform phase two.\u201d She admitted: \u201cThe real unknown in this, to be completely transparent, is asymptomatic and asymptomatic spread, and so if we find that there\u2019s a lot of asymptomatic individuals that we find in this active monitoring in what we are very much concerned about, the most vulnerable, then we will have to have increased testing to cover all of those sites.\u201d Pence also emphasised that states, not the federal government, would have to take responsibility for testing programmes. The absence of a national testing strategy is seen by critics as an attempt by the White House to avoid blame if problems arise. Pence said: \u201cAs the president\u2019s made clear, we want governors and states to manage the testing operations in their states. We\u2019ve given criteria, we\u2019ve given guidance for how we think that would best operate, but we\u2019re looking for the states, we\u2019re looking for the governors to manage it.\u201d Donald Trump himself tweeted on Friday, \u201cThe States have to step up their TESTING!\u201d, while also being accused of fomenting rightwing protests against lockdown measures in three states led by Democratic governors. With the US death toll now topping 32,000, Pence told the briefing that 3.7m tests had been conducted nationwide. Birx was working to identify additional testing capacity, he added, and the taskforce believed states could double it by activating existing laboratories. But Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted that there had been failings. He told reporters: \u201cIt was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected and it was an issue of embracing, the way we have now, and should have, the private sector who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them.\u201d Governors, members of Congress and public health experts have argued that testing should be more widespread and that the federal government needs to provide more resources. Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor at Brown University, told the Associated Press: \u201cThere are places that have enough test swabs, but not enough workers to administer them. There are places that are limiting tests because of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] criteria on who should get tested.

      "body": "<p>When a pandemic strikes, the world\u2019s leading experts convene \u2013 physically or virtually \u2013 in a hi-tech chamber in the basement of the Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organization.</p> \n<p>It is called the \u201cstrategic health operations centre\u201d, or SHOC, an appropriately urgent acronym for a place where life and death decisions are taken, and it is where critical choices were made in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re mostly like a 1950s, never-been-upgraded place, except for the SHOC room, which was built with all the screens everywhere and the desks with computers that rise up. The whole thing does look like something that Hollywood set up, imagining a pandemic,\u201d a WHO official said.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou sit there and you hear these experts from all over the world and they\u2019re really leading people. The best expertise available to get the best advice possible, it\u2019s a very impressive sense that hey, this is really how it is supposed to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 22 January, it was in this setting that the WHO emergency committee convened to make a pivotal decision on whether to advise the organisation to declare a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d (PHEIC) \u2013 a formal red alert for the world.</p> \n<p>The WHO had been sharing information with member states constantly since the first cluster of pneumonia cases was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December, but declaring a PHEIC still had huge symbolic importance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-30000-americans-trump-blame-who\">Coronavirus has killed 30,000 Americans, and all Trump can do is blame the WHO</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sat in the SHOC with his top advisers watching as a succession of speakers gave their views on the screens in front of them.</p> \n<p>First there were reports from China, and then Japan and Thailand where cases had been recently confirmed. Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world.</p> \n<p>The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily?</p> \n<p>If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose.</p> \n<p>The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question. So Tedros told it to convene again the next day, in the hope new data might create a consensus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b8b050f2-7484-487c-adc9-b48903770d86\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NeDeOxb4ofg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cTedros\u2019s only obligation under the law is to convene a committee but not to follow it. But he feels that politically he needs to get a unanimous decision before he acts or at least an overwhelming majority,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said.</p> \n<p>The second day\u2019s meeting however, changed no one\u2019s mind, and the impasse remained. Tedros had the committee adjourn pending further study and put it on notice to reconvene at short notice.

      "bodyText": "When a pandemic strikes, the world\u2019s leading experts convene \u2013 physically or virtually \u2013 in a hi-tech chamber in the basement of the Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organization. It is called the \u201cstrategic health operations centre\u201d, or SHOC, an appropriately urgent acronym for a place where life and death decisions are taken, and it is where critical choices were made in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly like a 1950s, never-been-upgraded place, except for the SHOC room, which was built with all the screens everywhere and the desks with computers that rise up. The whole thing does look like something that Hollywood set up, imagining a pandemic,\u201d a WHO official said. \u201cYou sit there and you hear these experts from all over the world and they\u2019re really leading people. The best expertise available to get the best advice possible, it\u2019s a very impressive sense that hey, this is really how it is supposed to work.\u201d On 22 January, it was in this setting that the WHO emergency committee convened to make a pivotal decision on whether to advise the organisation to declare a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d (PHEIC) \u2013 a formal red alert for the world. The WHO had been sharing information with member states constantly since the first cluster of pneumonia cases was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December, but declaring a PHEIC still had huge symbolic importance. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sat in the SHOC with his top advisers watching as a succession of speakers gave their views on the screens in front of them. First there were reports from China, and then Japan and Thailand where cases had been recently confirmed. Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world. The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily? If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose. The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question. So Tedros told it to convene again the next day, in the hope new data might create a consensus. \u201cTedros\u2019s only obligation under the law is to convene a committee but not to follow it. But he feels that politically he needs to get a unanimous decision before he acts or at least an overwhelming majority,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said. The second day\u2019s meeting however, changed no one\u2019s mind, and the impasse remained. Tedros had the committee adjourn pending further study and put it on notice to reconvene at short notice. A international health emergency was declared a week later, on 30 January, after clear evidence of community spread of Covid-19 had emerged. WHO under fire The events of January were always destined for scrutiny. The WHO conducts an after-action report in wake of every pandemic. But by seeking to make the global body the scapegoat for the debacle of the US response, Donald Trump has ensured each detail will become exhibits in a highly-politicised show-trial, likely to last as long as the election campaign. Furthermore, the president has used claims of WHO\u2019s dysfunction to justify cutting off US funding to it, worth over $400m a year, and hindering the organisation\u2019s ability to help counter the spread of the pandemic in fragile and poor countries around the world. In a hail of accusations hurled at the WHO in recent days, Trump has accused it of withholding critical information about the danger of Covid-19, and being under the control of China. None of the accusations are supported by the facts. China argued against declaring an emergency on 22 January, but could not have carried the argument alone. The other emergency members and advisers were experts from the US, Thailand, Russia, France, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Australia, Senegal, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and New Zealand. Their advice is confidential, but for the vote to have been split, several western, or western-aligned, representatives must have voted with Beijing. While the emergency committee took a week to decide to declare a PHEIC, Trump spent more than a month after that playing down the threat to the US, during which the country fell weeks behind the rest of the world in diagnostic testing and stockpiling essential equipment. There is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that the WHO hid information at China\u2019s behest. The US is well represented in the top ranks of the organisation. There were more than a dozen officials from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) embedded in the WHO in January and February. US health leaders were part of regular conference calls, weekly or twice weekly, beginning on 7 January. From 10 January those calls included warnings about the risk of human-to-human transmission. Trump\u2019s Taiwan angle Trump\u2019s most recent line of attack has been that the WHO ignored vital warnings from Taiwan. \u201cWhy did the WHO Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that coronvirus could be transmitted between humans?\u201d the president asked in a tweet on Friday, echoing a claim made by Taipei. However, the Taiwanese email appears to have made no such warning. It was sent from Taiwan\u2019s CDC to its WHO liaison officer on 31 December, hours after the first official report of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan were published online. According to the text provided to the Guardian, the email said: \u201cNews resources today indicate that at least seven, atypical pneumonia cases were reported in China.\u201d It restates the details of Chinese report, adding \u201cI would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.\u201d The email did not contain new information, and certainly nothing about human-to-human transmission.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis has led to a surge of interest in no-frills direct cremations, as families attempt to navigate the rules on physical distancing. While weddings have been banned to help curb the spread of Covid-19, funerals can still take place \u2013 but various restrictions mean that in many cases a traditional service will not be possible. On 31 March, Public Health England advised funeral directors and faith leaders to limit the number of mourners. Only members of the deceased person\u2019s household or close relatives can attend. If the individual does not have any family, then a \u201cmodest number of friends\u201d can be there, but at no point should mourners breach the two-metre rule. Attendees should also avoid face-to-face or physical contact \u2013 for example, hugging, unless they live in the same house. However, there is huge disparity across the country over how councils are enforcing the rules. For example, Coventry introduced a limit of just five family members at services. In other areas there is a maximum of 10 people, while some crematoriums have announced that all relatives are barred from services. After a row about a clampdown at York crematorium, the council said a faith officiant would be permitted, but immediate family members must stay outside. Under these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that funeral directors are reporting a rise in inquiries about direct cremation. A direct cremation is a simple, low-cost option where, typically, there is no funeral service \u2013 no flowers, limos or hymns \u2013 and no family or friends present. In its most basic form it is simply a cremation, and prices start at less than \u00a31,000. This type of service leaves families free to organise a more personal send-off later \u2013 perhaps a memorial service, ash scattering or celebration of life \u2013 once the lockdown is over and everyone is able to attend. David Bowie has been credited with putting this type of straightforward, fuss-free funeral on the map. The singer died of liver cancer in January 2016 and was reportedly secretly cremated without any of his family or friends present after telling loved ones he did not want a funeral service. His ashes were later scattered in Bali.

      "body": "<p>Next month the Conservatives will have been in power for 10 years. British parties who manage that anniversary are usually unpopular by the time it comes.</p> <p>In 1989, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government lost its poll lead for good. By 2007 Tony Blair was no longer a dominant premier. Accumulating mistakes, personal burn-out, the difficulty of finding fresh goals and voters\u2019 boredom with the status quo; all usually ensure that even parties with able leaders weaken and fall from power after three or four terms. To a large extent, the UK\u2019s traditional sense of itself as a diverse, healthy democracy depends on it.</p> <p>Yet recently our revered political pendulum seems to have stopped swinging. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-2019-election-result-a-new-political-landscape\">Tories won</a> their fourth consecutive general election, by a far larger margin than the others. Since then, their poll lead has swollen further. They are widely expected to win a fifth election, whenever it comes. No British party has done that since the early 1800s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/after-coronavirus-boris-johnsons-tories-will-be-a-very-different-party\">After coronavirus, Boris Johnson's Tories will be a very different party | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This Tory ascendancy has been maintained despite a record in office since 2010 that is arguably worse than those of the UK\u2019s most infamous modern governments, the overwhelmed Conservative and Labour administrations of the 1970s. The Tories have called and lost the EU referendum, pushed Scotland and Northern Ireland towards leaving the UK, pursued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-epidemic-decade-austerity-public-services\">austerity policies</a> that hugely damaged public services and society \u2013 without reducing government debt as promised \u2013 and presided over the worst wage growth for two centuries. Now they appear to be mishandling coronavirus catastrophically. Labour has never been allowed to forget its smaller failure to halt the winter of discontent, more than 40 years ago, when strikes notoriously delayed the burial of some people who had died of natural causes. After coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-cast-in-the-wrong-role-as-the-coronavirus-pm\">Britain may associate the Conservatives</a> with far worse horrors. </p> <p>But that is not happening yet.

      "bodyText": "Next month the Conservatives will have been in power for 10 years. British parties who manage that anniversary are usually unpopular by the time it comes. In 1989, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government lost its poll lead for good. By 2007 Tony Blair was no longer a dominant premier. Accumulating mistakes, personal burn-out, the difficulty of finding fresh goals and voters\u2019 boredom with the status quo; all usually ensure that even parties with able leaders weaken and fall from power after three or four terms. To a large extent, the UK\u2019s traditional sense of itself as a diverse, healthy democracy depends on it. Yet recently our revered political pendulum seems to have stopped swinging. Last year, the Tories won their fourth consecutive general election, by a far larger margin than the others. Since then, their poll lead has swollen further. They are widely expected to win a fifth election, whenever it comes. No British party has done that since the early 1800s. This Tory ascendancy has been maintained despite a record in office since 2010 that is arguably worse than those of the UK\u2019s most infamous modern governments, the overwhelmed Conservative and Labour administrations of the 1970s. The Tories have called and lost the EU referendum, pushed Scotland and Northern Ireland towards leaving the UK, pursued austerity policies that hugely damaged public services and society \u2013 without reducing government debt as promised \u2013 and presided over the worst wage growth for two centuries. Now they appear to be mishandling coronavirus catastrophically. Labour has never been allowed to forget its smaller failure to halt the winter of discontent, more than 40 years ago, when strikes notoriously delayed the burial of some people who had died of natural causes. After coronavirus, Britain may associate the Conservatives with far worse horrors. But that is not happening yet. Surveys show some mild public disapproval of their performance during the crisis. Yet there remains a general acceptance that, for the foreseeable future, for good or ill, the Tories will be our masters. Such feelings can be self-fulfilling.

In the meantime, it provide links to <a href=\"https://subcut.helixcentre.com/patient-carer-information\">two</a> documents, including <a href=\"https://helixcentre.com/project-end-of-life-toolkit\">a toolkit</a>, which give step-by-step instructions to help those caring for someone dying at home.</p> <p>The documents instruct family members how to insert and use cannulas to inject medication under the skin if the dying person is experiencing pain and other symptoms not controlled by their regular medication.</p> <p>Strong pain medications such as opioids, often used to manage pain, will be issued to families. But concern has also been raised about relatives of vulnerable people having to administer high doses of drugs such as morphine without sufficient oversight.</p> <p>There is also concern that enough checks will be made to ensure the opiates are not used by those other than the patient.</p> <p>\u201cThe guidance talks about delivering palliative care remotely, but how is that possible?\u201d said Caroline Abrahams of Age UK. \u201cIn a valiant and right attempt to protect NHS staff from contracting the virus, people are being left on their own when they need support.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are the safeguarding measures to stop people being bumped off?\u201d she asked. \u201cHelping someone die well is a specialist skill set. Unfortunately, it feels is thought people have been left to get on with it when a reasonable expectation of our society is that we get skilled palliative care.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Richard Vautrey, the GP committee chair at the British Medical Association, said families had not previously been asked to take on end-of-life care. \u201cBut as we have seen across the health and care system, processes are having to change and adapt in the face of what is an unprecedented situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it would only be done when individuals had the ability to do it safely and with supervision \u2013 albeit remotely in most cases. Only family members who are willing and able would be asked to do this \u2013 no one should be compelled to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cWe understand it is a distressing time for people whose loved ones are sick and if appropriate, we will support families and unpaid carers to safely take on elements of an individual\u2019s care, such as administering medicines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cCovid-19 is more than an NHS issue \u2013 it will take a nationwide effort to get through this crisis and so far, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous effort from our patient\u2019s families and friends. Where families are not comfortable taking on elements of their loved one\u2019s care, this will be respected.\u201d</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is already common practice for people who are willing and able to help care for family members receiving end-of-life care, supported by expert clinicians and with the right training, and just as is already the case no one will be asked to do things they cannot, or do not wish to, do.\u201d</p>",

In the meantime, it provide links to two documents, including a toolkit, which give step-by-step instructions to help those caring for someone dying at home. The documents instruct family members how to insert and use cannulas to inject medication under the skin if the dying person is experiencing pain and other symptoms not controlled by their regular medication. Strong pain medications such as opioids, often used to manage pain, will be issued to families. But concern has also been raised about relatives of vulnerable people having to administer high doses of drugs such as morphine without sufficient oversight. There is also concern that enough checks will be made to ensure the opiates are not used by those other than the patient. \u201cThe guidance talks about delivering palliative care remotely, but how is that possible?\u201d said Caroline Abrahams of Age UK. \u201cIn a valiant and right attempt to protect NHS staff from contracting the virus, people are being left on their own when they need support. \u201cWhere are the safeguarding measures to stop people being bumped off?\u201d she asked. \u201cHelping someone die well is a specialist skill set. Unfortunately, it feels is thought people have been left to get on with it when a reasonable expectation of our society is that we get skilled palliative care.\u201d Dr Richard Vautrey, the GP committee chair at the British Medical Association, said families had not previously been asked to take on end-of-life care. \u201cBut as we have seen across the health and care system, processes are having to change and adapt in the face of what is an unprecedented situation,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it would only be done when individuals had the ability to do it safely and with supervision \u2013 albeit remotely in most cases. Only family members who are willing and able would be asked to do this \u2013 no one should be compelled to do so.\u201d Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cWe understand it is a distressing time for people whose loved ones are sick and if appropriate, we will support families and unpaid carers to safely take on elements of an individual\u2019s care, such as administering medicines. \u201cCovid-19 is more than an NHS issue \u2013 it will take a nationwide effort to get through this crisis and so far, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous effort from our patient\u2019s families and friends. Where families are not comfortable taking on elements of their loved one\u2019s care, this will be respected.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is already common practice for people who are willing and able to help care for family members receiving end-of-life care, supported by expert clinicians and with the right training, and just as is already the case no one will be asked to do things they cannot, or do not wish to, do.\u201d",

Huge areas of the monkeys\u2019 habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/18/over-half-of-worlds-wild-primate-species-face-extinction-report-reveals\">threatened with extinction</a>.</p> <p>Researchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own.

The project was launched last month to emulate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/01/japanese-cherry-blossom-in-full-bloom-in-pictures\">hanami</a>, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom.</p> <p>Next year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose \u2013 it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn.</p> <p>On similar lines, the <a href=\"https://naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\">Nature\u2019s Calendar website</a> run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more.</p> <h2>City Nature Challenge</h2> <p>Coronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons\">bounding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/20/dolphins-and-fish-nature-moves-into-spaces-left-empty-by-italian-coronavirus-quarantine-video\">splashing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\">scurrying</a> to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different.</p> <p>Participants photograph any form of wildlife \u2013 from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals \u2013 droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</a> app and the online community helps to identify them.</p> <p>It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife.</p> <h2>Rainy days</h2> <p>One for the rainy days is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/call-isolated-britons-help-digitise-historical-rainfall-data\">project from Reading University</a>, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain\u2019s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/10/data-store-drought\">detailed pictures</a> of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change.</p> <p>But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue\">Rainfall Rescue</a> project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records.</p> <p>Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. \u201cThese records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.\u201d</p> <h2>Lighting up the world</h2> <p>Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people\u2019s lives is through providing safe access to power, for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/06/fossil-fuels-poverty\"> clean cooking</a> and for lighting, that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/260-million-school-global-fund-child-marriage-trafficking-labour\">help children with their learning</a> and adults to earn extra money.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">Power To </a><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">the People project</a> will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid.</p> <h2>Baby burbling</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/30/neuroscientists-decode-brain-speech-signals-into-actual-sentences\">Human speech</a> is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day.</p> <p>The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound.</p> <p>Armchair researchers can <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds\">listen to the recordings</a> and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time?</p> <h2>TB or not TB</h2> <p>Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/14/why-is-the-world-losing-fight-against-history-most-lethal-disease-tb-tuberculosis\">on the rise again</a>, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world.</p> <p>Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/antibiotic-resistance-as-big-threat-climate-change-chief-medic-sally-davies\">resistance is growing</a>. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mrniaboc/bash-the-bug\">signed up already</a>.</p> <h2>Pick up a penguin</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch/about/research\">Penguin Watch</a> allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries.</p> <p>Monitoring has been inhibited by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/sound-of-icebergs-melting-journey-into-antarctic-jonathan-watts-greenpeace\">difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas</a>, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected.</p> <p>Researchers at Oxford University are using <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch\">people\u2019s penguin spotting assistance</a> to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin\u2019s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating.</p>",

They are uploaded via the iNaturalist app and the online community helps to identify them. It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife. Rainy days One for the rainy days is a project from Reading University, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain\u2019s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up detailed pictures of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change. But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the Rainfall Rescue project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records. Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. \u201cThese records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.\u201d Lighting up the world Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people\u2019s lives is through providing safe access to power, for clean cooking and for lighting, that will help children with their learning and adults to earn extra money. The Power To the People project will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid. Baby burbling Human speech is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day. The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound. Armchair researchers can listen to the recordings and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time? TB or not TB Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is on the rise again, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world. Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where resistance is growing. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have signed up already. Pick up a penguin Penguin Watch allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries. Monitoring has been inhibited by the difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected. Researchers at Oxford University are using people\u2019s penguin spotting assistance to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin\u2019s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating.",

Mark Read, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest employer in the marketing and advertising sector, welcomes a working from home revolution but says it is not right for everyone. \u201cIf you said to me five weeks ago that I would have 100,000 people working from home and we would function fine, I\u2019d say you were mad,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the most common [video] town hall questions I get globally is about working from home [longer term]. There is interest in it but there is also a demand to come back to an office. Junior employees and those in shared accommodation find homeworking much more difficult than senior executives with houses and gardens.\u201d For one London-based animation and special effects business, Jellyfish Pictures, working from home has been a surprise success. In the future its staff will find that, on certain days of the week, their new morning commute routine is limited to walking to the kitchen for a coffee. Jellyfish, which employs about 250 staff and has credits including Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Black Mirror, has continued to work on projects including a film for the Shrek-maker DreamWorks despite shutting its five UK studios six weeks ago. \u201cWhat we have learned from this is that there hasn\u2019t been any drop in productivity,\u201d the Jellyfish founder, Phil Dobree, says. \u201cSome practices have improved, such as communication, which is actually more regular and efficient remotely. In the office, meetings often unnecessarily run on, or conversely people don\u2019t communicate enough \u2013 now they are.\u201d The speed with which Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter ordered their employees globally to make the shift to homeworking in late February and early March makes a challenging transition for many companies look easy. \u201cMost Facebook employees are fortunate to be able to work from home,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged in a post on Thursday. \u201cWe know that most people can\u2019t work from home as easily as many of our employees can.\u201d Indeed, the companies that are most able to adapt to homeworking are limited to sectors such as media, tech and financial services. For others representing vast areas of employment \u2013 airlines; bricks-and-mortar retail; car manufacturing \u2013 it is impossible. But adaptation is occurring where it can. A US survey by the research firm Gartner has found that three-quarters of chief financial officers believe that at least 5% of their workforce \u2013 who previously worked in company offices \u2013 will become permanent work-from-home employees after the pandemic ends. Of those CFOs, 17% believe a fifth of staff will move to working from home and 4% believe that half of employees will become remote workers. The lessons learned from lockdown could spark a more rapid and widespread \u201cvirtualisation\u201d of business practices, according to one investor. \u201cIt is clear to us that we are likely to see an increasing virtualisation of business life,\u201d says Jamie Ross, a fund manager of Henderson EuroTrust. \u201cRemote working has gone much more smoothly than many companies feared. We will see more people working from home, smaller office spaces, more meetings being conducted online and less corporate travel.\u201d From that perspective, the likely long-term losers are airlines, hotels and a commercial property sector already reeling from the destruction being wrought upon retailers. It will also change some industries that have been under pressure but can adapt at least. The publishing industry has had the technology to allow many staff to work from home for years, but many companies have been resistant to implementing widespread flexible working practices. The impact of the coronavirus has accelerated the long-term pressures publishers have been battling, including the decline in print sales and drift of readership and advertising online to the behemoths of Google and Facebook. As balance sheets are further stretched, the cost savings from being able to reduce office space is likely to prove attractive. \u201cCoronavirus has concertinaed a lot of change we have been seeing over the last number of years in just three months, flexible working being one of them,\u201d says James Wildman, the chief executive of the Cosmopolitan owner, Hearst UK, and a former executive at the publisher of the Mirror and Express titles. \u201cOffice space is costly, and tends to be high density, and a lot of people will be uncomfortable with that even after the virus. Forward-thinking managers were already pushing flexible working but in more traditional industries, like newspaper publishing, there has unfortunately been a cultural lag.\u201d City banks were some of the first to split their operations, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays sending thousands of staff to work from home, or in disaster recovery sites in areas of London including Croydon, Lewisham and Northolt, last month. John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, says it will start dawning on bosses that most banking roles \u2013 including research, trading and sales \u2013 are desk jobs that can ultimately be done from home. \u201cThis will be a revolution in terms of how we work,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wastage. A lot of people travel abroad for one meeting and I think those days are over.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>What do you think about the future of Test cricket? Do we need to shorten it or </strong><strong>produce more sporting pitches? (Nasih Ul Wadud Alam </strong><strong>) </strong>I don\u2019t think we need to shorten Test cricket and the wickets are actually pretty sporting these days. The key is to avoid extremes. The best pitches have a bit of seam and a bit of spin but are good to bat on too.</p> <p><strong>Being so elegant and seemingly effortless at batting, do you find that people think you are not trying when you are in a bad run of form? (Jack Counsell</strong><strong>) </strong>For sure. But that\u2019s been the case since I was young. If I got out people would say it was a lazy shot or I wasn\u2019t interested. I am interested, it\u2019s just my style and it looks like that. I feel like anyone else on the inside, and commit to shots the same. But I think commentators understand it more these days. Someone like David Gower moving into the commentary box probably helped. He almost gave players like myself a voice among all the analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/play-test-cricket-tomorrow-if-i-got-call-says-moeen-ali\">Moeen Ali: I'd play Tests for England tomorrow if I got the call</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Are you more nervous coming out to bat or before you bowl your first ball? (Chloe Hole</strong><strong>) </strong>Definitely before bowling my first ball. The responsibility I have with the ball, especially in Test matches, is a lot more than my batting. I\u2019m still nervous before batting, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just there\u2019s more on me as a bowler, especially if I\u2019m the only spinner in the team. The more you play the more you get used to the nerves and start to embrace them.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give boys and girls thinking about trying to make a career out of cricket? (Rob Hamill</strong><strong>)</strong><em> </em>The cliche about working hard is true. But beyond this, I would tell any young cricketer to make sure they really enjoy the company and camaraderie. Runs and wickets are one thing, but the friendships you make during your playing days, and the times you enjoy together, will stay with you for ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"560bb2a023f4775fd2efae8238ce0f793719e79f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/560bb2a023f4775fd2efae8238ce0f793719e79f/0_74_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler (right) before play in the second Test against West Indies at North Sound in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler (right) before play in the second Test against West Indies at North Sound in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Hardest away ground you\u2019ve played at? (Charlie @crobertson95<br>Toughest place to tour? Declan Heels</strong><strong>)</strong><em> </em>Australia is for me, personally, the hardest place to tour. The wickets are so good for batting, which made bowling hard, and mentally it was quite challenging. In terms of the ground, Newlands in Cape Town is pretty tough to bowl on as a spinner.</p> <p><strong>When was the last time </strong><strong>you played a game for </strong><strong>your local club side and how did it go? And do</strong><strong> you think </strong><strong>you\u2019ll be tempted to play club cricket again when </strong><strong>you eventually retire</strong><strong>? (Tony Medlock</strong><strong>) </strong>It was probably in 2014, a week before my Test debut. I have no idea how I got on, though. This year I have signed up for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC, where my two brothers (Kadeer and Omar) and cousin (Kabir) play. Any spare weekend, I\u2019ll join them \u2013 if we get a season. I\u2019ll play professionally for as long as I can and I\u2019ll definitely play club cricket after that, probably until I can\u2019t physically do it any more. There\u2019s no ego. I don\u2019t mind if the eyes go and some rubbish bowlers get me out \u2013 I\u2019ve got out loads of times!</p> <p><strong>The one thing you would change about cricket? (Sam @sam_willet) </strong>I\u2019d probably say slightly fewer international fixtures or cut down some of the bigger tours length-wise \u2013 it can get very hard if you play all formats. One thing I wish we could change overall would be the price of equipment. It\u2019s a very expensive sport to take up for kids if they want good-quality kit. Especially in England.</p> <p><strong>What is the biggest meltdown you\u2019ve witnessed when a dismissed batsman has returned to the dressing room? (Dan Davis</strong><strong>) </strong>At Worcestershire it was Vikram Solanki putting his foot through a wall and getting it stuck in there. For England it was Alex Hales smashing his helmet up into the smallest pieces I\u2019ve ever seen using his bat. Both were pretty funny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/how-cricket-may-have-begun-sunshine-jimmy-anderson\">Sunshine and wickets: how the county cricket season might have begun | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Which English Test ground is your favourite to bowl on and why? (Nathan Boroda</strong><strong>) </strong>There\u2019s two. Old Trafford for the bounce, which all spinners enjoy, and then also Lord\u2019s for the slope. Even if there\u2019s not much turn from the pitch, it gives you some natural variation to work with from either end.</p> <p><strong>What style of batting</strong><strong> best </strong><strong>suits your game in the long format? </strong><strong>You have been moved around the order with mixed success, but seem</strong><strong> at </strong><strong>your best when</strong><strong> taking on the bowling. (Tom Barrington</strong><strong>) </strong>It\u2019s changed over time. When I first came in I was a bit more reserved, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/24/sri-lanka-second-test-one-ball-left-end-england-resistance\">during my first Test hundred at Headingley</a>. That was the best of my five. But lower down the order I\u2019ve always felt putting pressure back on the bowlers is the way to go. It has made trying to switch back and grind it out harder.</p> <p><strong>How do</strong><strong> you think I can get my young nephew and niece interested in the game? (Michael Brenna</strong><strong>) </strong>Play the game with them and keep the drills very simple so that when they make those little improvements through repetition, it sparks their interest more and more.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever see yourself captaining England and is it something you aspire to do? (James Hancock</strong><strong> and Dave Churchley</strong><strong>) </strong>There would probably need to be four players injured. I enjoy captaining Worcestershire and we\u2019ve had success but with England it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve thought about too much. You have ambitions like anyone but, realistically, it\u2019s not really crossed my mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b19fbf1acaad21ab2df427572b9d8cc1fc8a15ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19fbf1acaad21ab2df427572b9d8cc1fc8a15ab/0_190_5312_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moeen Ali takes a catch off John Campbell during the third Test against West Indies in February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moeen Ali takes a catch off John Campbell during the third Test against West Indies in February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Favourite curry house in Birmingham? (Jack Downes</strong><strong>) </strong>I don\u2019t tend to go to them because the food at home is usually better. I like Lebanese or Moroccan restaurants when I\u2019m out. My current favourite is Al-Bader, a Lebanese on Ladypool Road in Birmingham.</p> <p><strong>When do</strong><strong> you think </strong><strong>you will be ready to return to the England Test set-up or do</strong><strong> you consider </strong><strong>your Test career done now? (David Shankland</strong><strong>) </strong>I think I\u2019d probably be ready now, to be honest. Clearly I would have to be playing well and win a spot back on merit but in terms of being available \u2013 and obviously I\u2019m speaking hypothetically \u2013 if there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call, I\u2019d say \u2018yes\u2019. We\u2019re all missing cricket right now and the coronavirus [hiatus] makes you realise what you love. It could take out the whole summer and that would be a big thing.</p> <p><strong>Thoughts on Headingley 2014? </strong><strong>You scored an unbeaten hundred and almost denied Sri Lanka a win only for </strong><strong>Jimmy Anderson, last man in, to get out off the penultimate delivery. (Rex Clementine @RexClementine) </strong>The memories are a little bit bitter because we lost. But the innings did so much for my self-belief and knowing I could play at international level. It\u2019s a shame too because if we\u2019d saved the match that innings might have been spoken about more. We lost and it almost became a bit, yeah, whatever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af20042e04b1ecc4f747cc98f1c3d8eeaa820b4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af20042e04b1ecc4f747cc98f1c3d8eeaa820b4e/0_255_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moeen Ali celebrates his century against Pakistan at the Oval in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moeen Ali celebrates his century against Pakistan at the Oval in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Who is the greatest all-rounder, Kallis or Stokes? (Al Prince</strong><strong>) </strong>It\u2019s a tough one. You\u2019d probably have to go Kallis as it stands because his body of work is so much bigger: more runs, wickets, catches etc. But if Stokesy carries on like he is he will become one of the greatest players to ever play the game.

      "bodyText": "What do you think about the future of Test cricket? Do we need to shorten it or produce more sporting pitches? (Nasih Ul Wadud Alam ) I don\u2019t think we need to shorten Test cricket and the wickets are actually pretty sporting these days. The key is to avoid extremes. The best pitches have a bit of seam and a bit of spin but are good to bat on too. Being so elegant and seemingly effortless at batting, do you find that people think you are not trying when you are in a bad run of form? (Jack Counsell) For sure. But that\u2019s been the case since I was young. If I got out people would say it was a lazy shot or I wasn\u2019t interested. I am interested, it\u2019s just my style and it looks like that. I feel like anyone else on the inside, and commit to shots the same. But I think commentators understand it more these days. Someone like David Gower moving into the commentary box probably helped. He almost gave players like myself a voice among all the analysis. Are you more nervous coming out to bat or before you bowl your first ball? (Chloe Hole) Definitely before bowling my first ball. The responsibility I have with the ball, especially in Test matches, is a lot more than my batting. I\u2019m still nervous before batting, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just there\u2019s more on me as a bowler, especially if I\u2019m the only spinner in the team. The more you play the more you get used to the nerves and start to embrace them. What advice would you give boys and girls thinking about trying to make a career out of cricket? (Rob Hamill) The cliche about working hard is true. But beyond this, I would tell any young cricketer to make sure they really enjoy the company and camaraderie. Runs and wickets are one thing, but the friendships you make during your playing days, and the times you enjoy together, will stay with you for ever. Hardest away ground you\u2019ve played at? (Charlie @crobertson95 Toughest place to tour? Declan Heels) Australia is for me, personally, the hardest place to tour. The wickets are so good for batting, which made bowling hard, and mentally it was quite challenging. In terms of the ground, Newlands in Cape Town is pretty tough to bowl on as a spinner. When was the last time you played a game for your local club side and how did it go? And do you think you\u2019ll be tempted to play club cricket again when you eventually retire? (Tony Medlock) It was probably in 2014, a week before my Test debut. I have no idea how I got on, though. This year I have signed up for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC, where my two brothers (Kadeer and Omar) and cousin (Kabir) play. Any spare weekend, I\u2019ll join them \u2013 if we get a season. I\u2019ll play professionally for as long as I can and I\u2019ll definitely play club cricket after that, probably until I can\u2019t physically do it any more. There\u2019s no ego. I don\u2019t mind if the eyes go and some rubbish bowlers get me out \u2013 I\u2019ve got out loads of times! The one thing you would change about cricket? (Sam @sam_willet) I\u2019d probably say slightly fewer international fixtures or cut down some of the bigger tours length-wise \u2013 it can get very hard if you play all formats. One thing I wish we could change overall would be the price of equipment. It\u2019s a very expensive sport to take up for kids if they want good-quality kit. Especially in England. What is the biggest meltdown you\u2019ve witnessed when a dismissed batsman has returned to the dressing room? (Dan Davis) At Worcestershire it was Vikram Solanki putting his foot through a wall and getting it stuck in there. For England it was Alex Hales smashing his helmet up into the smallest pieces I\u2019ve ever seen using his bat. Both were pretty funny. Which English Test ground is your favourite to bowl on and why? (Nathan Boroda) There\u2019s two. Old Trafford for the bounce, which all spinners enjoy, and then also Lord\u2019s for the slope. Even if there\u2019s not much turn from the pitch, it gives you some natural variation to work with from either end. What style of batting best suits your game in the long format? You have been moved around the order with mixed success, but seem at your best when taking on the bowling. (Tom Barrington) It\u2019s changed over time. When I first came in I was a bit more reserved, like during my first Test hundred at Headingley. That was the best of my five. But lower down the order I\u2019ve always felt putting pressure back on the bowlers is the way to go. It has made trying to switch back and grind it out harder. How do you think I can get my young nephew and niece interested in the game? (Michael Brenna) Play the game with them and keep the drills very simple so that when they make those little improvements through repetition, it sparks their interest more and more. Do you ever see yourself captaining England and is it something you aspire to do? (James Hancock and Dave Churchley) There would probably need to be four players injured. I enjoy captaining Worcestershire and we\u2019ve had success but with England it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve thought about too much. You have ambitions like anyone but, realistically, it\u2019s not really crossed my mind. Favourite curry house in Birmingham? (Jack Downes) I don\u2019t tend to go to them because the food at home is usually better. I like Lebanese or Moroccan restaurants when I\u2019m out. My current favourite is Al-Bader, a Lebanese on Ladypool Road in Birmingham. When do you think you will be ready to return to the England Test set-up or do you consider your Test career done now? (David Shankland) I think I\u2019d probably be ready now, to be honest. Clearly I would have to be playing well and win a spot back on merit but in terms of being available \u2013 and obviously I\u2019m speaking hypothetically \u2013 if there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call, I\u2019d say \u2018yes\u2019. We\u2019re all missing cricket right now and the coronavirus [hiatus] makes you realise what you love. It could take out the whole summer and that would be a big thing. Thoughts on Headingley 2014? You scored an unbeaten hundred and almost denied Sri Lanka a win only for Jimmy Anderson, last man in, to get out off the penultimate delivery. (Rex Clementine @RexClementine) The memories are a little bit bitter because we lost. But the innings did so much for my self-belief and knowing I could play at international level. It\u2019s a shame too because if we\u2019d saved the match that innings might have been spoken about more. We lost and it almost became a bit, yeah, whatever. Who is the greatest all-rounder, Kallis or Stokes? (Al Prince) It\u2019s a tough one. You\u2019d probably have to go Kallis as it stands because his body of work is so much bigger: more runs, wickets, catches etc. But if Stokesy carries on like he is he will become one of the greatest players to ever play the game. No doubt. Does racism still exist in top-flight cricket? (Stuart Drysdalen) I don\u2019t really experience it these days. Maybe you hear the odd comment or a stereotype that sounds like it could be a bit \u2018that way\u2019. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really in the sport. Do you realise how much the majority of England fans love you and do you use a sports psychologist? (Simon Brett) The sports psychologists use me, rather than the other way around. In all seriousness, I do a bit but I also think there are limits and sometimes only a player or coach who has experienced the same problem as you\u2019re facing can help. Yes and no on the fans question. You know there are a lot of fans and it\u2019s nice to hear when they say they enjoy watching you play. True fans get it. But it doesn\u2019t matter who you are, even Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli, there will always be people against you for whatever reason. It\u2019s not always cricket-related either.

      "body": "<p>Ordinarily, a week that includes new releases from directors Xavier Dolan and Richard Linklater would count as a major one in most cinephiles\u2019 books. Two film-makers \u2013 one a prodigious <em>enfant terrible </em>who made seven films before turning 30, one a long-established godfather of American indie cinema \u2013 with little in common otherwise, they can both boast a prolific output, a distinctive stylistic signature, and a devoted club of admirers that all but deserted them on the two new films in question.<br></p> <p>For the coronavirus shutdown isn\u2019t the reason you\u2019re not seeing Dolan\u2019s <em>The Death and Life of John F</em><em> Donovan</em> or Linklater\u2019s <em>Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</em>on the big screen in the UK. After underwhelming in festivals and/or cinemas abroad, they were already slated to shuffle with little fanfare on to<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Life-John-F-Donovan/dp/B086WN98VJ\"> the usual VOD platforms </a>this spring \u2013 a pretty sorry outcome for films that boast not only major auteurs, but glitzy all-star casts and, in the case of Linklater\u2019s film, a bestselling source novel. In this market, name power only goes so far.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to tell you that these films deserved better; sadly, neither can be called underrated. Of the two, <em>The Death and Life of John F</em><em> Donovan</em> is at least the more fascinating folly. The first English-language film by the distinctively Quebecois Dolan, it falls right into the tin-eared trap that has snared many a gifted world-cinema luminary switching to English, but you can\u2019t say it does so without ambition and bravado. Thrashing about in various narrative directions across multiple timelines, it vaguely follows the open-hearted correspondence between a lonely child actor (Jacob Tremblay) and his idol, a tortured, closeted movie star (Kit Harington). Said to have run four hours in its initial cut, it bears all the scars of a troubled edit: a subplot starring Jessica Chastain was excised in its entirety. What has survived, despite Dolan\u2019s typically lush craftsmanship, is antic and scarcely coherent.</p> <p>Trim and digestible by comparison, <em>Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</em> isn\u2019t an unpleasant watch. It\u2019s just disappointingly beige given the seemingly winning combination of Linklater, star Cate Blanchett and Maria Semple\u2019s sly, nimble comic novel. Tracing the mystery of a well-heeled but agoraphobic Seattle housewife who disappears on the eve of a family trip, it follows the thrust of the novel but never quite nails its tone: the jangly satirical elements clash with the more mournful character study at its heart, leaving much of the film in a bland limbo. Blanchett\u2019s amusingly mannered turn is the tangiest thing here, though it\u2019s hard to defend the surprise Golden Globe nomination she won for this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d016e26610be9269bb1ccf49d93e733f07a991\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d016e26610be9269bb1ccf49d93e733f07a991/0_0_4500_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett lifts Richard Linklater\u2019s \u2018disappointingly beige\u2019 Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Blanchett lifts Richard Linklater\u2019s \u2018disappointingly beige\u2019 Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilson Webb</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is that both directors\u2019 better days are easily available via streaming. My own favourite Dolan film, the anxiously atmospheric, Highsmith-infused queer thriller <strong>Tom at the Farm</strong>, can be found<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/tom-at-the-farm/id874861108\"> on iTunes</a>, as can is his still-electrifying 2009 debut <strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/i-killed-my-mother/id579334246\">I Killed My Mother</a></strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/i-killed-my-mother/id579334246\">,</a> a troubled mother-son battlefield made when he was just 19, and bristling with raw, ragged adolescent energy.

      "bodyText": "Ordinarily, a week that includes new releases from directors Xavier Dolan and Richard Linklater would count as a major one in most cinephiles\u2019 books. Two film-makers \u2013 one a prodigious enfant terrible who made seven films before turning 30, one a long-established godfather of American indie cinema \u2013 with little in common otherwise, they can both boast a prolific output, a distinctive stylistic signature, and a devoted club of admirers that all but deserted them on the two new films in question. For the coronavirus shutdown isn\u2019t the reason you\u2019re not seeing Dolan\u2019s The Death and Life of John F Donovan or Linklater\u2019s Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadetteon the big screen in the UK. After underwhelming in festivals and/or cinemas abroad, they were already slated to shuffle with little fanfare on to the usual VOD platforms this spring \u2013 a pretty sorry outcome for films that boast not only major auteurs, but glitzy all-star casts and, in the case of Linklater\u2019s film, a bestselling source novel. In this market, name power only goes so far. I\u2019d love to tell you that these films deserved better; sadly, neither can be called underrated. Of the two, The Death and Life of John F Donovan is at least the more fascinating folly. The first English-language film by the distinctively Quebecois Dolan, it falls right into the tin-eared trap that has snared many a gifted world-cinema luminary switching to English, but you can\u2019t say it does so without ambition and bravado. Thrashing about in various narrative directions across multiple timelines, it vaguely follows the open-hearted correspondence between a lonely child actor (Jacob Tremblay) and his idol, a tortured, closeted movie star (Kit Harington). Said to have run four hours in its initial cut, it bears all the scars of a troubled edit: a subplot starring Jessica Chastain was excised in its entirety. What has survived, despite Dolan\u2019s typically lush craftsmanship, is antic and scarcely coherent. Trim and digestible by comparison, Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette isn\u2019t an unpleasant watch. It\u2019s just disappointingly beige given the seemingly winning combination of Linklater, star Cate Blanchett and Maria Semple\u2019s sly, nimble comic novel. Tracing the mystery of a well-heeled but agoraphobic Seattle housewife who disappears on the eve of a family trip, it follows the thrust of the novel but never quite nails its tone: the jangly satirical elements clash with the more mournful character study at its heart, leaving much of the film in a bland limbo. Blanchett\u2019s amusingly mannered turn is the tangiest thing here, though it\u2019s hard to defend the surprise Golden Globe nomination she won for this. The good news is that both directors\u2019 better days are easily available via streaming. My own favourite Dolan film, the anxiously atmospheric, Highsmith-infused queer thriller Tom at the Farm, can be found on iTunes, as can is his still-electrifying 2009 debut I Killed My Mother, a troubled mother-son battlefield made when he was just 19, and bristling with raw, ragged adolescent energy. I prefer it to Mommy, a more ornately styled development of similar themes, though it\u2019s perhaps his most celebrated film; iTunes, again, has it for a mere 99p. Linklater\u2019s filmography, meanwhile, gives you a surfeit of choice, whether you prefer the woozy, seductive chatter of the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight trilogy (all available on Amazon), or the spiky, frayed Gen X energy of his breakthrough film, Slacker (Amazon again). The confident, unforced effervescence of more commercial efforts like School of Rock (free to stream on Prime or Now TV) is what his latest lacks. Meanwhile, we\u2019re probably enough years away from the overworked critical discourse around Boyhood (on Netflix) to reappreciate his 12-year coming-of-age portrait for the beguiling experiment it was. Linklater is reattempting that trick next, embarking on a two-decade schedule to film Sondheim\u2019s Merrily We Roll Along. Dolan has since emerged from the wreckage of John F Donovan to make the far leaner, better Matthias &amp; Maxime, which will be in cinemas later this year. Few will remember these straight-to-VOD blips, but for curious completists they\u2019re quietly there. Also new on streaming Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (Disney, 12) It can\u2019t just be the stretched nature of quarantine time that makes this latest JJ Abrams-directed Star Wars instalment feel a very distant memory: lacking the visual splendour and narrative verve of Rian Johnson\u2019s The Last Jedi, it\u2019s risk-free and hard to love. Blue Story (Paramount, 15) A grassroots sensation in cinemas, Rapman\u2019s south London gang-war tale covers pretty familiar turf, but there\u2019s a fury to its point of view that makes it feel fresh, as do strong performances by newcomer Stephen Odubola and electrifying Bafta winner Micheal Ward. Sergio (Netflix) This Sundance-premiered biopic of the late UN diplomat S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello is stately and well acted by Wagner Moura and Ana de Armas, but a bit colourless: director Greg Barker made a more absorbing documentary (also on Netflix) on the subject in 2009. Black Christmas (Universal, 15) \u2019Tis not the season for this tongue-in-cheek redo of the 70s Yuletide horror, but it went unnoticed in cinemas and deserves a second life: director Sophia Takal and writer April Wolfe wittily bring 21st-century campus culture to the sorority-slasher formula. Cinema of Conflict: Four Films by Krzyszt of Kieslowski (Arrow, 15) A classy box set for fans of the late Polish master looking to go beyond Three Colours and Dekalog: a quartet of fine earlier films, including the ingenious split-narrative study Blind Chance, later ripped off by Sliding Doors.",

Beauty manufacturers have either ceased operations or switched focus to emergency supplies such as hand sanitiser to make a contribution to the Covid-19 effort. Hair and beauty salons are shut, leaving the (mostly freelance) stylists and therapists on the financial brink. Many will struggle to reopen. The beauty industry, in all corners, will struggle to recover from this crisis. And so, on the assumption that readers are mostly shopping online at the moment, I\u2019ve decided to use this space over the next few weeks to draw your attention to some of the truly brilliant independent British beauty brands who need your custom, more desperately now than ever.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start this week with skin. One of my most used and loved brands is <a href=\"https://merumaya.com/\" title=\"\">Merumaya</a>. Do get past the dated packaging, because what\u2019s inside is terrific. Its <strong>Youth Preserv</strong><strong>ation Moisturiser SPF20 </strong>and <strong>Retinol Resurfacing Treatment</strong> (both \u00a340 for 30ml) are respectively among the best day and night moisturisers around, and I\u2019m never without the <strong>Melting Cleansing Balm</strong> (\u00a320, 100ml), which shifts every scrap of dirt and makeup without taking moisture with it. Everything is vegan.</p> <p>A newer (and cheaper) discovery for me is Norfolk-based <a href=\"https://www.qandaskin.com/\" title=\"\">Q+A</a>. Like many modern brands, its focus is on single-ingredient products, but this little independent holds its own in a crowded field. <strong><a href=\"https://www.qandaskin.com/collections/shop-all/products/squalane\" title=\"\">Q+A Squalane Facial Oil</a></strong> (\u00a310 for 30ml) is beautiful, giving fine-textured, unsticky moisture to all but the very oiliest skins. There\u2019s a great little <strong><a href=\"https://www.qandaskin.com/collections/shop-all/products/hyaluronic-acid\" title=\"\">Hyaluronic </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.qandaskin.com/collections/shop-all/products/hyaluronic-acid\" title=\"\">Acid Facial </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.qandaskin.com/collections/shop-all/products/hyaluronic-acid\" title=\"\">Serum</a></strong> (no home should be without one) for just \u00a36.50 for 30ml, and the whole range looks stylish on the shelf \u2013 young people, in particular, love it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/14/the-best-online-skincare-experts-sali-hughes\">The best online skincare experts | Sali Hughes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similar in vibe, and fast becoming a bathroom staple for me, is The Inkey List. There\u2019s so much goodness here. One of my picks of the new releases is the <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-inkey-list-oat-cleansing-balm.html\" title=\"\">Oat </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-inkey-list-oat-cleansing-balm.html\" title=\"\">Cleansing Balm</a></strong> (\u00a39.99), a whopping 150ml tube of skin-softening, makeup-melting cleanser. Another is the <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-inkey-list-15-vitamin-c-and-egf-serum.html\" title=\"\">15% Vitamin C and EGF serum</a></strong> (\u00a314.99, 30ml), unusual in its higher dose of glow-giving, brightening vitamin C, without lashings of formula-spoiling silicone (it\u2019s not toxic, just vexing when it peels away under enthusiastic makeup application). All are cruelty-free, extremely good and as British as the Beeb. Please do support them if you can. More coming up. </p>",

Hair and beauty salons are shut, leaving the (mostly freelance) stylists and therapists on the financial brink. Many will struggle to reopen. The beauty industry, in all corners, will struggle to recover from this crisis. And so, on the assumption that readers are mostly shopping online at the moment, I\u2019ve decided to use this space over the next few weeks to draw your attention to some of the truly brilliant independent British beauty brands who need your custom, more desperately now than ever. Let\u2019s start this week with skin. One of my most used and loved brands is Merumaya. Do get past the dated packaging, because what\u2019s inside is terrific. Its Youth Preservation Moisturiser SPF20 and Retinol Resurfacing Treatment (both \u00a340 for 30ml) are respectively among the best day and night moisturisers around, and I\u2019m never without the Melting Cleansing Balm (\u00a320, 100ml), which shifts every scrap of dirt and makeup without taking moisture with it. Everything is vegan. A newer (and cheaper) discovery for me is Norfolk-based Q+A. Like many modern brands, its focus is on single-ingredient products, but this little independent holds its own in a crowded field. Q+A Squalane Facial Oil (\u00a310 for 30ml) is beautiful, giving fine-textured, unsticky moisture to all but the very oiliest skins. There\u2019s a great little Hyaluronic Acid Facial Serum (no home should be without one) for just \u00a36.50 for 30ml, and the whole range looks stylish on the shelf \u2013 young people, in particular, love it. Similar in vibe, and fast becoming a bathroom staple for me, is The Inkey List. There\u2019s so much goodness here. One of my picks of the new releases is the Oat Cleansing Balm (\u00a39.99), a whopping 150ml tube of skin-softening, makeup-melting cleanser. Another is the 15% Vitamin C and EGF serum (\u00a314.99, 30ml), unusual in its higher dose of glow-giving, brightening vitamin C, without lashings of formula-spoiling silicone (it\u2019s not toxic, just vexing when it peels away under enthusiastic makeup application). All are cruelty-free, extremely good and as British as the Beeb. Please do support them if you can. More coming up.",

      "bodyText": "Driving up one of Kabul\u2019s many steep hills, dotted with colourfully painted houses and surrounded by the snow-capped Hindu Kush mountains, the Afghan capital looks just like any other day. Children fly kites in the mild spring breeze, families take to their roofs to watch the sunset, bakers light their ovens to make fresh bread. But go in closer and the city of roughly 6 million people has changed. The usually traffic-jammed roads are almost empty, playgrounds are left without children, no restaurant is grilling sizzling kebabs by the roadside, and most people who are out wear face masks, their eyes fearful, suspicious. I usually navigate Kabul by motor scooter, a quick mode of transport on the otherwise busy roads \u2013 and now, in the time of coronavirus, a measure to keep the kind of distance that wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed in a taxi. At least 700 infections have been recorded throughout the country but, if more testing were available, the number would probably rise. The capital has been put on lockdown, with the city\u2019s head of hospitals, Nizamuddin Jalil, saying that \u201cwe will enter a critical period in the next three weeks\u201d. At the Afghan-Japan hospital for communicable diseases, the city\u2019s main coronavirus treatment centre, hundreds of patients arrive every day; most of them are sent home after a short consultation and temperature measurement. The ministry of public health has warned of a catastrophe as cases rise. Like most, I stay home as much as I can. But if I want to document the pandemic, I have to venture out. There are measures, of course: gloves, a mask, hand sanitiser. After each assignment, I disinfect my equipment and wash my clothes, always worried that I could be a coronavirus carrier, spreading it to others, especially those willing to have their photos taken or be interviewed. After covering the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, I swore to never report on infectious diseases again, because \u2013 unlike conflict \u2013 such work comes with a different underlying fear, of an invisible threat. You can\u2019t run from it easily. Yet reporting on the coronavirus is not a choice for journalists; for most, it\u2019s inevitable. Visually Kabul is beautiful, intriguing, stunning. A mix of Persian and Islamic architecture, as well as older, mud-brick neighbourhoods, the city\u2019s roads wind themselves through dramatic hills. People wear colourful dresses; the sun almost always shines. In some areas, life has to continue almost as usual, as food and vegetable markets are allowed to remain open and crowds mingle there. Namadulli Asad, 48, a construction worker, can\u2019t afford to stay at home and lose his daily pay. Harissa, three, her face covered by a mask, sits on the now empty street every day, begging for food and money with her mother. Asma, also three, lives in a comfortable apartment with her parents, gazing out of the window as her family has quarantined to keep safe. The discrepancies in Afghanistan are vast. Dr Ahmed Sultani, director of a 1,000-bed drug rehabilitation hospital, roamed Kabul\u2019s streets last week in a full protective suit, getting addicts off the streets and into treatment in the hope of preventing coronavirus from spreading further in some of the most dense neighbourhoods. \u201cThere are about 86,000 drug users here, and we\u2019re hoping to quarantine as many as possible,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Vending machines for the Sunday roast, fish to your door and salads grown in car parks \u2013 British farmers and food producers are finding new ways to get their produce to the table during lockdown, changes that may yield benefits long after restrictions ease.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/farmers-union-optimistic-uk-workers-will-rescue-the-harvest-covid-19\">Many UK farmers have been hard hit</a> by the coronavirus crisis, despite the strong demand for fresh food. Before the lockdown, half of all food and drink was consumed outside the home, and switching from supplying big catering companies and distributors has been proving difficult.</p> <p>But some farmers and food entrepreneurs are finding now is their time to shine, and the environmental benefits \u2013 and the profits \u2013 may encourage more to follow suit.</p> <p>Two years ago Neil Stephen, from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, invested in self-service vending machines dispensing everything from farmhouse cheese and shortbread (baked by his mother), to joints of meat, whole chickens and fresh fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>He was inspired by his grandfather who, in the late 1970s, used to leave a wheelbarrow at the gates of the family farm filled with turnips and cabbages, and an honesty box for people to pay.</p> <p> Now Stephen\u2019s investment is paying off, as people are attracted to a hygienic system where the goods are neatly packaged in portions in a refrigerated unit, behind glass doors. They punch in the number, pay by card and the windows open for them to collect the goods.</p> <p>Sales at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lowerthorneybank/\">Thorneybank Farm Shop</a> are up fivefold, Stephen reports. \u201cWe were rushed off our feet. It\u2019s worked phenomenally, it\u2019s been stratospheric.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-restaurants-pandemic-workers-communities-prices\">Restaurants will never be the same after coronavirus \u2013 but that may be a good thing | Jonathan Nunn</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The shop sells produce from neighbouring farmers, too, with asparagus and strawberries coming from six miles away, and eggs and dairy from three miles down the road. They can make better profit margins than they would selling to a big supermarket, without the hassle of door-to-door deliveries. The shop has a strong social media presence, and shoppers come from nearby Turriff town, while the city of Aberdeen is about 30 miles away.</p> <p>Fishing is another industry hard hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In normal times, most of Britain\u2019s catch is destined for overseas markets, from China to Spain, where the species commonly caught in UK waters appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes. People in the UK have proved reluctant to move beyond cod, haddock and tuna, which mostly has to be imported.</p> <p>The government has now announced \u00a31m for English fishermen to set up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/government-throws-englands-fishermen-a-10m-lifeline\">new ways to sell their catch</a> and find local markets. There are already schemes for distributing fresh-caught fish directly, such as <a href=\"http://www.soleshare.net/\">SoleShare</a> in London and<a href=\"https://www.call4fish.com/\"> Call4Fish</a>, a service that operates from Berwickshire to Cornwall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/milk-floats-ride-to-the-rescue-of-locked-down-british-households\">Milk floats ride to the rescue of locked-down British households</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Food campaigners hope these services, where the fish on offer depends on what is caught by small boats, will encourage a more sustainable way of fishing, as consumers experiment with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/02/how-can-shoppers-make-sense-of-sustainable-fish-labels\">species less overfished than cod</a> that might not previously have found a market.</p> <p>One Londoner, Sebastien Sainsbury used to work in the investment banks that tower over Canary Wharf in London. Now he has a company, <a href=\"http://www.cratetoplate.farm/\">Plate to Crate</a>, growing salad and other leafy greens in hydroponic towers in shipping containers, stacked up in air conditioned units under heat lamps with conditions carefully monitored.</p> <p>The containers seem more like labs than farms, with workers kitted out in protective gear, from boot shields to hairnets, to prevent pests getting in. As a result, the lettuce, kale, pak choi and herbs are free from pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, and water use is 96% lower than in fields, with wastewater being used on local lawns.</p> <p>The first harvest is due in May and, once all of the units are fully up and running, there could be 12 harvests a year, producing 15 to 18 tonnes from this site. Another will be producing soon in London\u2019s Elephant and Castle, where a development of 3,000 homes will receive salad weekly from containers.</p> <p>Sainsbury believes this is the future of fresh produce for fussy Londoners. \u201cYounger people are more focused on where their food comes from, how fresh it is, what\u2019s in it. This coronavirus crisis is an opportunity for us all to become aware of what we are eating.\u201d</p>",

But some farmers and food entrepreneurs are finding now is their time to shine, and the environmental benefits \u2013 and the profits \u2013 may encourage more to follow suit. Two years ago Neil Stephen, from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, invested in self-service vending machines dispensing everything from farmhouse cheese and shortbread (baked by his mother), to joints of meat, whole chickens and fresh fruit and vegetables. He was inspired by his grandfather who, in the late 1970s, used to leave a wheelbarrow at the gates of the family farm filled with turnips and cabbages, and an honesty box for people to pay. Now Stephen\u2019s investment is paying off, as people are attracted to a hygienic system where the goods are neatly packaged in portions in a refrigerated unit, behind glass doors. They punch in the number, pay by card and the windows open for them to collect the goods. Sales at Thorneybank Farm Shop are up fivefold, Stephen reports. \u201cWe were rushed off our feet. It\u2019s worked phenomenally, it\u2019s been stratospheric.\u201d The shop sells produce from neighbouring farmers, too, with asparagus and strawberries coming from six miles away, and eggs and dairy from three miles down the road. They can make better profit margins than they would selling to a big supermarket, without the hassle of door-to-door deliveries. The shop has a strong social media presence, and shoppers come from nearby Turriff town, while the city of Aberdeen is about 30 miles away. Fishing is another industry hard hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In normal times, most of Britain\u2019s catch is destined for overseas markets, from China to Spain, where the species commonly caught in UK waters appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes. People in the UK have proved reluctant to move beyond cod, haddock and tuna, which mostly has to be imported. The government has now announced \u00a31m for English fishermen to set up new ways to sell their catch and find local markets. There are already schemes for distributing fresh-caught fish directly, such as SoleShare in London and Call4Fish, a service that operates from Berwickshire to Cornwall. Food campaigners hope these services, where the fish on offer depends on what is caught by small boats, will encourage a more sustainable way of fishing, as consumers experiment with species less overfished than cod that might not previously have found a market. One Londoner, Sebastien Sainsbury used to work in the investment banks that tower over Canary Wharf in London. Now he has a company, Plate to Crate, growing salad and other leafy greens in hydroponic towers in shipping containers, stacked up in air conditioned units under heat lamps with conditions carefully monitored. The containers seem more like labs than farms, with workers kitted out in protective gear, from boot shields to hairnets, to prevent pests getting in. As a result, the lettuce, kale, pak choi and herbs are free from pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, and water use is 96% lower than in fields, with wastewater being used on local lawns. The first harvest is due in May and, once all of the units are fully up and running, there could be 12 harvests a year, producing 15 to 18 tonnes from this site. Another will be producing soon in London\u2019s Elephant and Castle, where a development of 3,000 homes will receive salad weekly from containers. Sainsbury believes this is the future of fresh produce for fussy Londoners. \u201cYounger people are more focused on where their food comes from, how fresh it is, what\u2019s in it. This coronavirus crisis is an opportunity for us all to become aware of what we are eating.\u201d",

Earlier today, the premier, <strong>Mark McGowan, </strong>said the man had been to Bali in March and described the travel as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s new statement this evening says the case is \u201cnot cause for alarm\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Rio Tinto conducted the test but public health officials are working to verify the results because the test used might not be reliable. </p> \n  <p>From the statement:</p> \n  <p>\u201cWestern Australians can be reassured that a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a mining worker, following a blood test performed by mining company Rio Tinto, is not cause for alarm and should not be interpreted as potential community transmission.</p> \n  <p>Western Australia\u2019s Chief Health Officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, said the case was one of only three being reported in WA overnight, with the other two linked to the cruise ship Artania.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the Department of Health was investigating the case and undertaking appropriate contact tracing but that there was no evidence of community transmission resulting from this case.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the case had become mildly symptomatic shortly after returning from a trip to Indonesia which would indicate he most likely contracted the virus overseas. He was in isolation for the period in which he would have been infectious.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the pin-prick test performed by Rio Tinto was <em>not</em> an acute diagnostic test or even a reliable means of screening for current Covid-19 infection.</p> \n  <p>He said the reason point-of-care testing had been banned as an acute diagnostic test under emergency provisions of the Public Health Act was because it measured the presence of antibodies to Covid-19 \u2013 not the virus itself. This could lead to results being misinterpreted, with both false negatives and false positives being common, as demonstrated by recent such testing.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said public health officials were currently working to verify the results of the individual at an accredited laboratory because the validity of the point-of-care test was unknown.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:35:08.493Z\">at 9.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ab13f8f08bade1f29582b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:50:46.189Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here\u2019s the Queensland premier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeAt20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MeAt20</a> - in Queensland of course! <a href=\"https://t.co/QQDBc0Mrkd\">pic.twitter.com/QQDBc0Mrkd</a></p>\u2014 Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:01:57.125Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aaae98f080ee11044736d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:25:52.213Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over the past few days, the #MeAt20 challenge has taken off on Twitter.

One of the deaths that happened yesterday was a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship, which is leaving Fremantle today on its way to the Philippines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease, and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cBut it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person\u2019s disease. We are all in this together for a reason. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause it can affect any of us, and while it is true to say that the majority of cases, over 80%, are mild, some of them can be very severe. <strong>We still have 55 people across Australia in intensive care right now, some of those have been ventilated, some of them extremely sick. </strong>These are really strong reminders for us why we are taking this disease seriously and why, indeed, the whole world is taking this pandemic seriously. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are continuing to concentrate on the way out of where we are now. Australia has done extremely well compared with the rest of the world up to this point. But it is not a time for us to decrease the measures that we have in place. We have, for example, been one of the major testing countries for Covid-19 and a recent paper published by the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine \u2013 I am an alumnus of that institution \u2013 shows that we are at the highest level in terms of case ascertainment and making sure that the cases that are out there are being found. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>We reached a milestone: we now have over 400,000 tests that have been done here in Australia, and so again, by sheer numbers, we are doing a lot of testing. </strong>But one of the challenges that was put back to the Australian health committee from the national cabinet on Thursday was for us to <strong>continue to look and consider what our testing strategy should be into the future. So that is part of our surveillance plan that we are developing, and we had a discussion about that today at our Australian health committee meeting with the other chief health offices. I chaired that meeting today and we discussed what that surveillance plan should look like and particularly what should we be doing in terms of expanding testing</strong> now that we have that capability to do so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other thing we discussed today at the committee meeting was about our rapid response capability. How should we, and how could we, respond to things like what is occurring in north-western Tasmania at the moment?\u201d</p> \n  <p>He is referring here to the healthcare worker in Tasmania with the virus who worked across with three aged-care facilities in the north-west, and as a result in the past 24 hours, almost 500 tests have been done on all the residents and the staff of those facilities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:43:05.422Z\">at 6.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a8a378f08b7689b030b83\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:11:00.104Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key announcements and updates from today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>federal government has said its Covid-19 tracing app will not be compulsory. </strong>The government services minister, Stuart Robert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/18/australia-coronavirus-updates-live-investigations-into-aged-care-homes-amid-outbreaks-latest-news?page=with:block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4#block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4\">revealed details about how the app will work</a>, saying there will be no geolocation, surveillance, or tracking of people with the app, and that the federal government would not have access to any of the app\u2019s data.

It simply swaps phone numbers and names. That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone. <strong>You control your own data and if you test positive to coronavirus, that information is given straight to state governments so they can contact individuals [who] may have come into contact with an infected person.</strong></p> \n   <p>Right now, a privacy impact assessment is being conducted. The privacy commissioner is involved, and all that will be made public. <strong>The source code will be made public,</strong> so all Australians can have absolute assurance, from the privacy right the way to the security, right the way to the individual elements, the bits and bytes of the code, that the app is simply a health app for individuals voluntarily used to help us trace those who may have been close to someone who has been infected by the virus. </p> \n   <p>So we want to be as transparent as we possibly can.

Here are the key events: A 93-year-old man who was a resident of Newmarch House, an aged care facility where there has been an outbreak of Covid-19, died this morning. Anglicare Sydney said he was suffering multiple serious health issues and a cause of death would be identified in coming days. A 74-year-old man died in Tasmania\u2019s Mersey hospital, a 58-year-old woman died in NSW and an 83-year-old Queensland man died in Sydney. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app would not be compulsory. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, said the app would not be a surveillance device. The Artania cruise ship departed Western Australia with 300 crew and 11 passengers on board. The Queensland government has offered $200m to struggling airline Virgin Australia, but with a number of conditions, including that the company keeps its headquarters in Brisbane. The deputy chief medical officer said as growth in new infections slowed, Australia needed to expand its testing regime to make it more proactive, rather than waiting for cases to present at hospitals and medical practices. Thanks again for following with us. You can continue to follow coronavirus news live from around the world here. Stay safe and we will see you again tomorrow. The Western Australian government has issued a fresh statement about the Rio Tinto contractor who tested positive for coronavirus. Earlier today, the premier, Mark McGowan, said the man had been to Bali in March and described the travel as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d. The government\u2019s new statement this evening says the case is \u201cnot cause for alarm\u201d. Rio Tinto conducted the test but public health officials are working to verify the results because the test used might not be reliable. From the statement: \u201cWestern Australians can be reassured that a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a mining worker, following a blood test performed by mining company Rio Tinto, is not cause for alarm and should not be interpreted as potential community transmission. Western Australia\u2019s Chief Health Officer, Dr Andrew Robertson, said the case was one of only three being reported in WA overnight, with the other two linked to the cruise ship Artania. Dr Robertson said the Department of Health was investigating the case and undertaking appropriate contact tracing but that there was no evidence of community transmission resulting from this case. Dr Robertson said the case had become mildly symptomatic shortly after returning from a trip to Indonesia which would indicate he most likely contracted the virus overseas. He was in isolation for the period in which he would have been infectious. Dr Robertson said the pin-prick test performed by Rio Tinto was not an acute diagnostic test or even a reliable means of screening for current Covid-19 infection. He said the reason point-of-care testing had been banned as an acute diagnostic test under emergency provisions of the Public Health Act was because it measured the presence of antibodies to Covid-19 \u2013 not the virus itself. This could lead to results being misinterpreted, with both false negatives and false positives being common, as demonstrated by recent such testing. Dr Robertson said public health officials were currently working to verify the results of the individual at an accredited laboratory because the validity of the point-of-care test was unknown. And here\u2019s the Queensland premier: Over the past few days, the #MeAt20 challenge has taken off on Twitter. It is as it sounds, users post a photo of themselves at the age of 20, generally in happier times than right now. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has today contributed this excellent entry: Now for some pieces that you might have missed today. First up, a story out of New Zealand about how the coronavirus lockdown is affecting pest control. With pest control not considered an essential service, rat and other pests are booming and there are concerns for wildlife. Luke Henriques-Gomes has written our regular round up of non-Covid headlines you might not have seen this week \u2013 ICYMI. Finally, Josh Taylor has written about what we know about the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app so far: Anglicare Sydney has released another statement about the death of a resident of Newmarch House in western Sydney this morning after an outbreak of Covid-19 at the aged care facility. The chief executive of Anglicare Sydney, Grant Millard, said the resident was a 93-year-old man who was suffering \u201cmultiple serious health issues\u201d. He said the man\u2019s relatives had been informed and the cause of death would be formally identified in coming days. \u201cAll Newmarch House residents were notified as were all staff. All relevant authorities have also been notified,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThank you to the Australian and NSW Health Departments in supporting us throughout this difficult time. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the grieving family through this very distressing time.\u201d McGowan is speaking more about the newly confirmed case, who returned from Bali. He confirms the man self-isolated on his return. \u201cHe returned from Bali on a holiday and has obviously acquired the illness there. We are doing everything we can to track down who he has been in contact with,\u201d McGowan says. \u201cBut I just want to reiterate, all of those people who went to Bali were selfish and jeopardised the health and well-being of other Western Australians.\u201d McGowan says the man was tested by Rio Tinto prior to his return to work but the company would provide more information on this at a later time. McGowan is now talking about the Artania in more detail. He says authorities made sure the ship was clean and ready to depart today with oversight from the Australian Border Force. \u201cMy position on this ship has been clear from the get-go. I wanted to make sure that we avoided the Ruby Princess debacle that we saw happen in Sydney,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cruise saga has been one of the most difficult issues we grapple with in WA.\u201d He says 300 crews and 11 passengers are on board the ship as it heads back to Europe. The ship will stop in Indonesia first where some crew will disembark before the ship sails on to Germany. \u201cEveryone on board has been given a clean bill of health after spending a full 14 days in quarantine. The ship is clean and authorities report no evidence of Covid-19 on board,\u201d McGowan says. \u201cAbout 79 crew members and 28 passengers remain in Perth, either in hotels or a smaller number, which is 11, in hospitals.\u201d Western Australia\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan, is speaking. He starts by noting the cruise ship Artania has departed this afternoon. He says he and WA residents are \u201cvery pleased to see it leave\u201d. McGowan says there was only one new confirmed WA Covid-19 case overnight, the second time there has been an increase of just one WA-based case in this pandemic. He says there are two more new cases from the Artania. He says there have been 245 cases linked to cruise ships. He also says 26,631 people have tested negative for Covid-19 in the state. The newly confirmed case today is a Rio Tinto contractor who travelled to Bali. McGowan describes it as \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d of the individual concerned to travel to Bali in the month of March. The NSW government says it is injecting $25m to fast-track statewide research and clinical trials to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce its impact on the community. It\u2019s part of $800m in already announced extra funding for the health budget. The funding will be directed to research focused on: Accurate and timely diagnosis of Covid-19. Support conducting Covid-19 clinical trials including vaccine trials. Monitoring, developing and evaluating strategies to slow community transmission. Developing and evaluating treatments for Covid-19. Preventing the need for intensive medical care. Minimising the impact of physical and psychological trauma on the community. Thanks for joining me for our live Covid-19 coverage today. I hope everyone is coping okay during these trying times. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Lisa Cox, who will carry you through to the evening. In the meantime and on a bright note, I will leave you with one of my favourite videos from the pandemic. Stay safe! The deputy chief medical officer is expanding on what he means by increasing surveillance. Prof Paul Kelly says he will be encouraging people to download the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app when it is released in a couple of weeks. He says the other aspect will be increasing testing. He says until now surveillance of cases has relied on people going to see a doctor if they are sick and the test going to the laboratory, then the result going to health departments who can then begin contact tracing. He says: What we\u2019re talking about here is something much more broad. Trying to find cases that would not necessarily come to hospital because we know that people that are mildly sick, they may not come to hospital or general practice or to one of the Covid clinics necessarily to seek treatment and they may not recognise the signs of being this particular illness. We are at that stage now of the epidemic in Australia where we need to take those ones much more seriously than we were when we were seeing hundreds of cases every day. And we were definitely concentrating on that side. So this is a way of getting out into the community and doing essentially relatively random testing potentially for people in high risk situations, for example. I know in other countries, they have done testing of supermarket employees, for example. Those pieces of information are obviously very vital in our response. The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, is giving an update in Canberra. One of the deaths that happened yesterday was a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship, which is leaving Fremantle today on its way to the Philippines. \u201cSo that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease, and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cBut it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person\u2019s disease. We are all in this together for a reason. \u201cBecause it can affect any of us, and while it is true to say that the majority of cases, over 80%, are mild, some of them can be very severe. We still have 55 people across Australia in intensive care right now, some of those have been ventilated, some of them extremely sick. These are really strong reminders for us why we are taking this disease seriously and why, indeed, the whole world is taking this pandemic seriously. \u201cWe are continuing to concentrate on the way out of where we are now. Australia has done extremely well compared with the rest of the world up to this point. But it is not a time for us to decrease the measures that we have in place. We have, for example, been one of the major testing countries for Covid-19 and a recent paper published by the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine \u2013 I am an alumnus of that institution \u2013 shows that we are at the highest level in terms of case ascertainment and making sure that the cases that are out there are being found. \u201cWe reached a milestone: we now have over 400,000 tests that have been done here in Australia, and so again, by sheer numbers, we are doing a lot of testing. But one of the challenges that was put back to the Australian health committee from the national cabinet on Thursday was for us to continue to look and consider what our testing strategy should be into the future. So that is part of our surveillance plan that we are developing, and we had a discussion about that today at our Australian health committee meeting with the other chief health offices. I chaired that meeting today and we discussed what that surveillance plan should look like and particularly what should we be doing in terms of expanding testing now that we have that capability to do so. \u201cThe other thing we discussed today at the committee meeting was about our rapid response capability. How should we, and how could we, respond to things like what is occurring in north-western Tasmania at the moment?\u201d He is referring here to the healthcare worker in Tasmania with the virus who worked across with three aged-care facilities in the north-west, and as a result in the past 24 hours, almost 500 tests have been done on all the residents and the staff of those facilities. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key announcements and updates from today: The federal government has said its Covid-19 tracing app will not be compulsory. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, revealed details about how the app will work, saying there will be no geolocation, surveillance, or tracking of people with the app, and that the federal government would not have access to any of the app\u2019s data. He said if two phones with the app downloaded to it were within 1.5 metres of each other for 15 minutes, the app would record the phone numbers and names of those people. That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone until it is needed. Four additional deaths have been recorded bringing Australia\u2019s total deaths to 69. These include a 74-year-old man who died at the Mersey hospital in Tasmania, an 83-year-old Queensland man who died in Sydney, and a 58-year-old woman in New South Wales. A resident of Newmarch House in western Sydney died on Saturday morning after an outbreak at the home, becoming the first death associated with that facility. Thirty people, including 10 staff and 20 residents, have tested positive with the virus in the home. The Queensland government said it would contribute $200m towards the Virgin airline. The state\u2019s development minister, Cameron Dick, said it was imperative Australia had two airlines to support tourism, jobs and regional investment. Queensland\u2019s support is conditional on debt restructuring, and shareholders and bondholders doing their bit. Overseas, the US president, Donald Trump, has posted highly incendiary tweets stoking protests against physical distancing and other coronavirus stay-at-home measures. A resident of Newmarch House in western Sydney has died after an outbreak at the home. Thirty people, including 10 staff and 20 residents, have tested positive with the virus. In a statement to residents, Anglicare, which manages the home, said: We are saddened to inform you that a resident of Newmarch House, who tested positive, passed away peacefully this morning. The resident\u2019s family has been contacted, as have all the relevant authorities. We would like to assure you that the staff are doing everything possible to care for your loved one. Please be assured of our prayers for you at this challenging time. Further updates will be provided to you in due course. On Friday the NSW chief health officer announced that every staff member and resident would be tested with the virus, even those who had already returned a negative result. Aged care homes are particularly vulnerable to spread once a case occurs. Dorothy Henderson Lodge, also in NSW, recorded multiple deaths following an outbreak there last month. The AFL\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, says Victoria remains a viable option to host a quarantine hub as the league edges closer to restarting the 2020 season, writes AAP reporter Jason Phelan. Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland had been viewed as key states in the hub plan, which would see teams split into three groups and isolated to limit their exposure to Covid-19. \u201cVictoria has extraordinary proximate facilities, so there are obviously opportunities, like there are in every state to various levels,\u201d McLachlan told Fox Footy on Saturday. Hubs, where teams are separated into three groups and isolated in different states to limit their exposure to Covid-19, is one of the scenarios the league is considering as it plots a way out of the financially crippling shutdown. Last week Victoria\u2019s sport minister, Martin Pakula, described the hubs as the AFL\u2019s best shot at completing the 2020 premiership season. As people were looking for ways to keep themselves entertained while isolated at home, they began sharing photos of themselves as 20 year-olds on Twitter. The hashtag #MeAt20 began trending on Twitter as people shared photos from their younger days. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton is the latest to jump on the bandwagon of reminisce, and it\u2019s a ripper. Looking to the US for a moment where our Washington reporter David Smith reports that president Donald Trump has posted highly incendiary tweets stoking protests against physical distancing and other coronavirus stay-at-home measures. Smith reports: \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d the US president wrote in capital letters on Friday. \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d He followed up with a third tweet: \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d \u2013 a reference to Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, last week signing into law new measures on gun control. Trump has repeatedly ignored his own entreaty to put partisan politics aside during the coronavirus pandemic. His latest provocative interventions followed demonstrations against stay-at-home orders in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and other states that have drawn elements of the far right. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. They have been egged on by conservative media hosts such as Fox News\u2019s Jeanine Pirro, who said: \u201cWhat happened in Lansing [Michigan] today, God bless them: it\u2019s going to happen all over the country.\u201d At Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, Trump played down fears that by crowding together, the protesters could spread the Covid-19 illness. \u201cThese are people expressing their views,\u201d he said. \u201cI see where they are and I see the way they\u2019re working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they\u2019ve been treated a little bit rough.\u201d The Western Australia government has appointed a travel agent to help bring home Western Australians currently in others states and to return those quarantined in Perth back to their state or territory of origin. The state government said the appointment of FCM Travel Solutions will provide support and assistance to those who need help booking their commercial flight to get them back home. While the cost of the flights will be the responsibility of the individual, associated booking fees normally associated with a travel agent will be covered by the state government. Western Australians returning home will need to produce their letter of quarantine completion upon arrival and undertake a further 14-day quarantine at home. Exemptions may be granted, but these will need to be applied for in advance. Visit the wa.gov.au website for further information. Travellers leaving Western Australia have been told to check with their home states about any conditions applying to them. The FCM Travel Solutions dedicated phone number for post-quarantine travel into and out of Western Australia is 1300 165 764. Bunnings is trending on Twitter as Australians use their time in isolation to catch up on DIY projects, gardening and home improvement. Long lines have been reported outside the stores, and Bunnings is limiting the number of customers inside at any one time due to social distancing measures. I asked on Twitter what you\u2019re all buying. Paint and plants seem popular. AAP reports that the New Zealand Warriors boss, Cameron George, is hoping the NRL team can arrive in Australia in time to resume training with rival clubs on 4 May. The league is forging ahead with plans to relaunch its season in late May after meetings with broadcasters on Friday. It remains unclear how many games will be played and how much the networks will be willing to pay for a restructured competition. However, all parties agreed on aiming for a return to action on 28 May, with teams pencilled in to recommence squad runs in just 16 days. The inclusion of the Warriors remains a significant hurdle because of international travel restrictions on both sides of the Tasman. The club is also demanding answers on a number of key issues before deciding whether to stay in Australia for up to seven months. Among them include player renumeration, competition structure, and whether families will also be able to be housed with the team. \u201cOnce that comes to light, we\u2019ll be better equipped to make the right decision,\u201d George told Fox Sports News on Saturday. \u201cAnd then we get to Australia, we can train with every other club from the 4th of May on. That\u2019s our goal, notwithstanding a lot of water to go under the bridge.\u201d In a joint statement, Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, and transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, said the federal government must help the crew of the Covid-19-infected Ruby Princess. It comes as the owner of the cruise liner company is being sued by the family of a US citizen who died from the disease. \u201cOnly crew members who return negative test results and volunteer to remain on the vessel for the ship\u2019s journey to its next port should remain on the vessel,\u201d the statement said. They say the government must work with the cruise company and the International Transport Workers Federation which represents the crew to repatriate the remaining crew members as quickly and safely as possible. \u201cEach day that passes without the Morrison government helping this stranded crew to get home safely risks more people on board contracting Covid-19, and placing unnecessary additional stress on the NSW health system,\u201d they said. The NSW government has announced $25m to fast-track statewide research and clinical trials to tackle Covid-19. The state\u2019s health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the funds are part of about $800m in extra health funding from the state. The funding will be directed to research focused on: accurate and timely diagnosis; support conducting Covid-19 clinical trials including vaccine trials; monitoring, developing and evaluating strategies to slow community transmission; developing and evaluating treatments; preventing the need for intensive medical care; minimising the impact of physical and psychological trauma on the community. Before the press conference on the tracing app ends the government services minister is asked what he has to say to people still struggling with the CentreLink system, spending hours on the phone and trying to access assistance. Stuart Robert replies: To give you an understanding, we normally process 10,000 claims a week for jobseeker. This week we\u2019ll process 210,000 claims, 21 times [the normal amount]. In the last three weeks, we have processed nine months worth of annualised claims. That gives you the volume of work staff are working through. Today there\u2019s 4,500 staff working right now. There\u2019s tech teams working around the clock. Those looking for a customer reference number, that went live yesterday. You can go to MyGov right now to get a CRN, to get access to a payment right now, online, a 100-point check. There\u2019s an enormous amount of tech and resourcing going and Services Australia are stepping up to the plate. A reporter presses, asking: \u201cPeople are still frustrated, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Robert: \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented crisis with unprecedented demand. We ask people to be patient.\u201d Stuart Robert further explains how the Covid-19 tracing app will work: Let\u2019s say I have got the app downloaded and I test positive to the virus. I will literally click enter, I have tested positive. The last 21 days of people I may have come into contact with, so for 15 minutes in a one-and-a-half metre proximity, goes up to a national health data store, and because the app knows what suburb I live in, that information goes straight to the state health authorities and the state health authorities do the tracking. At no point does the commonwealth get the data at all. And when the pandemic is done, I delete the app and all the data from my phone and then I, the minister, will blow away the national datastore and therefore no data will be kept for individual citizens. Nobody will be forced to use it. It is absolutely voluntary. There is no question I will be the first one to download it, probably after the prime minister, and we will be encouraging everybody to download it. I will be encouraging corporate Australia, not-for-profits, to actually download it. It is a big moment for Australia. If we want to loosen these restrictions we have got to be able to have an effective tracing mechanism. The current mechanism, manual, is very good. But a digital mechanism will advance that in terms of days. Days quicker for your family to find out if you have been in proximity to someone with the virus. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, is giving an update from the Gold Coast about the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app, which has caused some confusion and concern among Australians over how data would be stored and collected and whether it would be compulsory. Earlier on Saturday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, clarified that the app would not be compulsory. Robert says: The app itself, CovidTrace, simply digitisers a manual process. Nothing more, nothing less. It is entirely voluntary. It will be available in the next week or two for Australians to use. And all it does is, it allows a manual process to be sped up digitally. Right now if you test positive to coronavirus, health officials will sit down with you and ask you to trace back where you were and who you have been with. And it is really hard to try to remember the 90-year-old lady in the queue behind you at a shopping centre, or a family that was close by you for whatever purpose. CovidTrace as an app digitises that and allows the tracing aspect to be sped up. The intent being, and what we really want, is for as many Australians as possible, well over 40%, to download the app. It works very simply. There is no geolocation, there is no surveillance, there is no tracking. The app simply connects with another [phone with the] app if those two phones are within 1.5 metres for 15 minutes. It simply swaps phone numbers and names. That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone. You control your own data and if you test positive to coronavirus, that information is given straight to state governments so they can contact individuals [who] may have come into contact with an infected person. Right now, a privacy impact assessment is being conducted. The privacy commissioner is involved, and all that will be made public. The source code will be made public, so all Australians can have absolute assurance, from the privacy right the way to the security, right the way to the individual elements, the bits and bytes of the code, that the app is simply a health app for individuals voluntarily used to help us trace those who may have been close to someone who has been infected by the virus. So we want to be as transparent as we possibly can. It is a big team Australia moment. AAP reports the first face-mask testing facilities in Australia will be launched in Adelaide: Millions of respirator and surgical masks needed to help stop the spread of Covid-19 will be produced at Australia\u2019s first face mask testing facilities established in Adelaide. The state government is allocating $450,000 for the project where more than 20m masks will be produced each month for local and national markets. The equipment will be tested at Flinders University and the University of South Australia laboratories and will begin production in May. Prof Karen Reynolds at Flinders University said face masks needed to meet strict standards to protect hospital staff, filter out bacteria, resist blood, withstand wear and tear, and still be breathable. The innovation and skills minister, David Pisoni, said as China produced most of the global supply of face masks, science, research and collaboration have never been more important. \u201cUsually testing is undertaken in the United States, taking around three weeks,\u201d Pisoni said. \u201cWith this new testing facility we will be able to deliver this medical equipment to hospitals within weeks, substantially faster than previously.\u201d Some good news from the ACT: there have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the past 24 hours. Its total is still 103; 88 cases have recovered and been released from self-isolation. This is 85% of all confirmed cases in the ACT. There is one Covid-19 patient in the Canberra hospital. The rest are isolating at home with ACT Health support. NSW police have given an update about the investigation into the handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship. More than 20 deaths and 600 cases have been linked to the ship. The New South Wales police homicide squad is gathering evidence for the investigation. The NSW assistant commissioner said the ship is unlikely to leave Port Kembla tomorrow and will probably remain docked until late next week. Authorities are not at a point where they can say the crew are well enough to travel. There are 162 crew on board who have tested positive for the virus, an additional nine from yesterday, and there are 13 crew members in health facilities in NSW. Over to NSW where the state\u2019s health minister, Brad Hazzard, has just told reporters in the 24-hour period to 8pm last night, the number of cases in the state has continued to slow with just 10 new cases. There are 2,936 cases in NSW. But Hazzard says there have been two deaths overnight, an 83-year-old man and a 58-year-old woman. The 83-year-old has been included in Queensland\u2019s death toll as he was a resident of that state, and was included in the Queensland premier\u2019s update earlier in the day. \u201cI think on behalf of the entire NSW community, I want to express my sympathy, and the community\u2019s sympathy, to the families of those two people,\u201d Hazzard said. Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus is now at 68. Senator Penny Wong, the shadow foreign affairs minister, says with today marking one month since the Australian government changed its travel advice to \u2018Do Not Travel\u2019 it is time to repatriate those who have been stranded overseas. More than 11,000 Australians have registered for consular help, with no commercial options available, Wong said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent the last month emptying their bank accounts on commercial flights that have been cancelled \u2013 while watching citizens of other countries rescued by their governments,\u201d the statement said. Labor is calling on the government to organise assisted departure flights for the 6,600 Australians stranded in India, as well as flights for the 650 Australians stranded in South Africa, 1,100 in the Philippines, and nearly 2,000 in Thailand and Bangladesh. An urgent plan was needed for the Australians still stranded in the Middle East and South America, Wong said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back and say there was more we could have done to bring stranded Australians home to safety,\u201d she said. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the Queensland government\u2019s $200m to Virgin Australia will assist in keeping the airline running. The airline has so far been unsuccessful in its request for a $1.4bn loan from the federal government. But McCormack said the federal government was exploring all avenues to keep both Virgin and Qantas going. \u201cSustaining Australia\u2019s aviation industry is critical to protecting livelihoods and saving lives and the federal government is exploring all possible avenues to keep two airlines in the air, throughout this pandemic and on the other side of it,\u201d McCormack told AAP on Saturday. \u201cI welcome states and territories exploring ways to assist their local aviation businesses and welcome the Queensland government\u2019s commitment to Virgin.\u201d McCormack said the federal government had made a \u201csignificant investment\u201d of an initial $165m to keep Qantas and Virgin operating essential domestic network services, including the most crucial metropolitan and regional routes in Australia. He said there was a heavy focus on Queensland routes. That brings the federal government\u2019s total support to the aviation industry to $1.28bn. The Queensland government has boosted specialist support for seniors by enlisting Uniting Care Queensland to the Care Army. The Covid-19 seniors taskforce co-chair, Kate Jones, said it means seniors in distress can get on the phone and talk to a specialist seven days a week. \u201cWe understand that having to stay in isolation for long periods of time can be distressing and add to people\u2019s loneliness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve boosted funding to Uniting Care to put on more staff to answer these calls for help.\u201d Uniting Care Queensland is assisting those in quarantine who are over the age of 70, over the age of 65 and have an underlying health condition, or are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the age of 50. Those people can call the community recovery hotline on 1800 173 349. The service will work with other local providers including Meals on Wheels, neighbourhood centres and social isolation services. The seniors inquiry line had already helped hundreds of Queensland seniors, including those needing help with groceries, a flu shot, transport and loneliness. Over to Queensland where the health minister, Steven Miles, is announcing that an 83-year-old Queensland man has died after contracting the virus. \u201cHe [died] in Sydney and we were advised by New South Wales Health yesterday and obviously will have more detail soon,\u201d Miles said. \u201cEvery Queensland life is precious and I pass on my condolences to that family and their friends and relatives. It is obviously a very sad day for them.\u201d There are now 1,014 cases in Queensland, Miles said. There have been six deaths. The additional deaths announced so far today in Tasmania and Queensland brings Australia\u2019s death total to 67. The Tasmanian premier and health minister are holding a press conference. As of 6pm yesterday, there were an additional four cases of coronavirus, bringing the state\u2019s total to 184. Sadly there has been an eighth death from Covid-19 there, a 74-year-old man who died at the Mersey hospital. The premier, Peter Gutwein, urged people to: \u201cTurn on your lights, light a candle, put a light out the front of your home and actually demonstrate the support we have for all of the people that are doing so very much, and going above and beyond to help both those that are in the midst of fighting this virus, but those that are dealing with it as well.\u201d Two \u201cvery different situations\u201d were playing out in Tasmania. \u201cIn the north-west we obviously have an outbreak that we have to work very hard to contain and get on top of and we are taking every measure that we can,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the south of the state we\u2019re not seeing the same level of positive cases ... It demonstrates the early measures we put in place are working \u2013 we just have an outbreak we need to get on top of. It underlines the fact that Tasmanians cannot become complacent. It underlines the fact that the rules are in place to ensure that we stay safe.\u201d AAP Canberra journalists Colin Brinsden and Marty Silk report that two former Australian foreign affairs ministers have weighed in on China\u2019s knowledge of the origin of the coronavirus before it became a global pandemic. They write: Alexander Downer, who was foreign affairs minister under the Howard government, said China must come clean on Covid-19 or it would \u201carouse the wrath\u201d of the world. He said there was still speculation about whether the virus jumped from bats to humans directly, in wet markets or escaped from scientific labs. He told the Australia-UK Chamber of Commerce that the world would demand answers from China after the pandemic. \u201cFor China this is a slow burn,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far China sending masks and testing kits \u2013 some of which apparently don\u2019t work too well \u2013 to other countries and saying: \u2018Oh look we\u2019re here to help you,\u2019 \u201d he said a webinar on Friday. \u201cCome on guys. You started it in the first place. Let\u2019s find out how that happened and let\u2019s do our best to make sure that can never happen again.\u201d Downer said if China was not transparent, some countries would try to counter its global influence \u201cwhich will be confrontational and prima facie not to be encouraged\u201d. Chinese exporters could suffer as countries reviewed their supply chains for raw materials and essential products. He also believed Australia and the UK in particular would mull their dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals and rare earth metals like lithium. China is Australia\u2019s number one trading partner. Julie Bishop, who was foreign affairs minister under the Coalition Abbott and Turnbull governments, said Australia\u2019s relationship with China was \u201cunder constant review\u201d. \u201cI think we will see a different world when we pass through this pandemic,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cI\u2019m sure many nations will be looking to diversify and perhaps bring a greater domestic focus on supply chains.\u201d The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has also demanded China be more transparent about the origins of coronavirus. He said the families of more than 60 Australians who had died deserved answers about how the outbreak originated. Downer called for China and the WHO to lead a probe, but it must involve scientists from the international community, including the west. \u201cThere has to be a proper investigation into how this happened, where it came from, and China will, I think in time, be put under huge pressure to agree to that investigation,\u201d he said. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, will hold a press conference at 12.30pm (AEST) to talk about the government\u2019s Covid-19 contact tracing app. On Saturday, after confusion grew about the app and how it would be rolled out, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, issued a tweet to say the app would not be mandatory. Morrison added: \u201cWe will be seeking the cooperation and support of Australians to download the app to help our health workers, to protect our community and help get our economy going again.\u201d AAP reports that the Queensland government has offered $200m to help rescue Virgin Australia as the cash-strapped airline struggles to survive. The airline suspended trading in its shares to continue talks on financial aid and restructuring alternatives to help it weather the coronavirus downturn. Queensland\u2019s state development minister, Cameron Dick, said it was imperative Australia had two airlines to support tourism, jobs and regional investment. \u201cQueensland has given Australia both our national airlines \u2013 we won\u2019t let them go, or let thousands of families watch their jobs go, without a fight,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it alone, and nor should we, because all parts of Australia benefit from two national airlines.\u201d Queensland\u2019s support was conditional on debt restructuring, shareholders and bondholders doing their bit. The airline\u2019s headquarters would also need to remain in Brisbane and regional flights would need to continue. The deal would also require the federal government to chip in. Earlier the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said there would be no early end to Queensland\u2019s tough lockdown restrictions. The state\u2019s infections continued to rise: six people tested positive on Friday. The total stands at 1,007 with 19 people in hospital, with 11 in intensive care. The state\u2019s death toll remains at five. On Thursday, National Cabinet agreed to release the management and operational plan for Covid-19 for people with disability. Currently, there are more than four million people with disability in Australia. Today the health minister Greg Hunt said this plan will \u201csave and protect some of Australia\u2019s most vulnerable\u201d. \u201cSome people with disability are significantly more at risk of adverse health outcomes if they become infected with coronavirus than the general population\u2013this plan will ensure our support is joined up for these at risk groups,\u201d he said. The plan addresses factors such as the reliance on close contact with carers and support workers, having a compromised immune system, and the presence of multiple underlying health conditions. The plan can be found here and will be updated periodically as new evidence emerges. It document states the goals of the plan are to: recognise that people with disability have an inherent right to life and its enjoyment on the same basis as others provide people with disability the same standard of health care as other persons provide people with disability access to health services as close to their own community as possible, including rural and remote areas promote dignity, autonomy, and respect for people with disability when receiving health care and that the provision of health care is free from bias or discrimination Meanwhile in Birdsville, in outback Queensland, a police officer is doing his part to keep local businesses afloat ... by moonlighting as a pizza delivery driver. I decided to give the officer in charge at Birdsville police station, senior constable Stephan Pursell, a ring, and he told me it was true. Once he knocks off his shift at the station this evening he will become a delivery driver for the Birdsville Hotel, an iconic venue that coronavirus has left struggling. As the only person manning the Birdsville station, Pursell has one of the most remote jobs in the country. The town is on the edge of the Simpson Desert, almost 1,600km west of Brisbane. In summer it gets upwards of 45C. \u201cSo in some ways, the town is used to isolation,\u201d Pursell says. \u201cWe go into summer trading mode from December through to March, and everyone kind of bunkers down until the heat is over.\u201d But once the heat starts to ease off the town relies on tourists coming through to support businesses such as the Birdsville Hotel. With Coivd-19 lockdowns and shutdowns under way, the town has lost a lot of that business. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d deliver pizzas for the hotel as a bit of a novelty and also to show my support and help them out,\u201d says Pursell, who is originally from Victoria. \u201cThis is a small, close community and I\u2019m in a position to do it, and it\u2019s something different I can do to help. But importantly for me, it gives me a chance to check up on people and make sure they\u2019re going OK. I hope it provides something a bit fun for the community during these hard times.\u201d His top pizza pick? \u201cI\u2019m a meat-lovers fan all the way.\u201d The latest figures for Victoria have just come in. The state\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos ,says there are 1,319 cases, including 14 deaths. There are 136 cases that may indicate community transmission has occurred. There are 30 people in hospital, including 12 in intensive care. Meanwhile 1,172 people have recovered and more than 79,000 Victorians have been tested. My colleague Michael McGowan reports that many of the services Sydney\u2019s rough sleepers rely on have disappeared in the Covid-19 lockdown. But others have adapted, like the Wayside Chapel in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross. McGowan writes: Like everything else, an average day at the chapel has been turned on its head in the past month. Where usually the not-for-profit homelessness service\u2019s famous rabbit-warren headquarters in the Cross would be a hive of activity until late into the night, now the doors are locked and the building near-empty. Outside, the people who still rely on the services Wayside has been offering since the mid-1960s mill around; they charge their phones, wait to speak to counsellors about temporary housing or simply try to avoid the police. Hazel, in her 20s and homeless, hasn\u2019t received her usual disability pension. She is \u201cvery, very short\u201d on money: \u201cMost of my street family have gone into housing since all this, so I\u2019m on my own. It\u2019s very hard. I just sleep anywhere. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if it doesn\u2019t come soon.\u201d Read the full story here. In sport news Australian cricketers Glenn Maxwell and James Faulkner are the latest to lose English county cricket contracts because of uncertainty over coronavirus. AAP reports the international allrounders were due to represent Lancashire during the domestic T20 Blast competition but the club announced on Friday that overseas deals would be terminated because of uncertainty over when cricket in England would resume. The England and Wales Cricket Board initially put the season on hold until at least 28 May but uncertainty remains about whether there will be further interruptions. New Zealand Test wicketkeeper-batsman BJ Watling has also had his red-ball deal terminated. The ECB still hope the vaunted Hundred competition will be able to start on 15 July, but there have been calls for it to be postponed until 2021, with tickets sales suspended and players such as David Warner withdrawing. Australia Test spinner Nathan Lyon\u2019s red ball contract with Hampshire was also terminated last week. Just looking globally for a minute, researchers at Johns Hopkins University say more than 2.2 million people have been confirmed as having contracted the virus worldwide. Their data shows at least 153,00 have died. Italy\u2019s total death toll has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after the US. The US daily coronavirus death toll hit a new record. According to the Wall Street Journal, 4,591 Americans died over the 24 hours to Thursday, nearly doubling the record of 2,569 that was set on Wednesday. The country\u2019s total death stands at 34,614. Meanwhile, 14,576 people have died in the UK. In further aged-care home developments, hundreds of residents and staff at three nursing homes in north-west Tasmania are expected to get their Covid-19 test results on Saturday, AAP reports. The state government issued blanket testing across the Melaleuca nursing home in east Devonport, the Eliza Purton home in Ulverstone, and Coroneagh Park in Penguin after the discovery that a healthcare worker had done shifts at all three facilities before testing positive for coronavirus. The person also worked at two closed hospitals in Burnie at the centre of the outbreak, which is linked to almost 100 of the state\u2019s 184 cases. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, claimed on Friday the healthcare worker in question had been dishonest about their contacts, but state authorities later said this was inaccurate. Tasmania\u2019s total number of coronavirus cases is 184, with four more in the north-west region added on Friday evening. Tasmania has had seven deaths. Good morning, Melissa Davey with you for another Saturday of Australia Covid-19 coverage and curve-flattening news. To recap the latest, the national death toll rose on Friday to 65. The latest deaths include a 72-year-old Tasmanian man, and a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship died in Perth. The 42-year-old became the youngest person in Australia to die from the virus. Meanwhile an aged-care home in NSW has grappled with a major outbreak throughout the past week. Thirty staff and residents at the Anglicare Newmarch House have tested positive for Covid-19. It has prompted health authorities to test every staff member and resident, including those who already tested negative. As my colleague Josh Taylor explains in this piece, the prime minister has not ruled out making a Covid-19 tracking app mandatory. The Australian government is planning to launch an app in a matter of weeks which will trace every person who has been in contact with a mobile phone owner who has tested positive for coronavirus in the previous few weeks. This is in a bid to automate coronavirus contact tracing, and allow restrictions to be eased. Josh has answered some of your questions about the app in his piece. In business news, the federal government announced on Friday it would spent $165m to underwrite Qantas and Virgin to conduct domestic flights for at least eight weeks. In upsetting news, a database collecting racist incidents against Asian Australians has received 178 responses in two weeks \u2013 roughly 12 incidents a day. Queensland police also condemned a rise in anti-Asian racism that has led to 22 criminal charges of racially motivated offences in the state. As Jason Yat-sen Li writes: \u201cThere is one area of civic discourse where we are letting ourselves down, and that is the marked uptick in racial abuse of Asian Australians.\u201d Meanwhile the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association issued a media release detailing occasions of medical practitioners denying Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders access to culturally safe healthcare seeking testing for Covid-19. These cases in rural NSW and Western Australia involved medical practitioners refusing Covid-19 related healthcare on the grounds of patient identity and racist stereotypes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders not practising self-hygiene. Let me know if I miss anything throughout the day over at Twitter or by emailing melissa.davey@theguardian.com. As always, be nice, especially to each other. On Friday morning an Anglicare spokesman said 10 staff and 20 residents at the western Sydney Anglicare Newmarch House aged-care facility had Covid-19, a doubling in cases associated with the home in 24 hours. The aged care quality and safety commission issued a statement overnight, saying it was involved in discussions with representatives from the NSW office of the federal health department and the NSW public health unit. \u201cThese discussions are focusing on ensuring that the service receives appropriate support to assist its management of the evolving situation in relation to the Covid-19 outbreak, and to concentrate on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of residents at the service,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Matthew Fowler\u2019s 87-year-old father is in Newmarch House and returned a negative test for Covid-19 earlier in the week. But Fowler told Guardian Australia he had been retested on Friday along with all the other residents. Fowler said he wanted infection control procedures at the home reviewed. He has also made a complaint to the aged care quality and safety commission.",

      "body": "<p>Workers who had only just started new jobs before coronavirus hit UK businesses are caught in a \u201cfurlough trap\u201d, with the government scheme to cover 80% of their income unavailable to their employers.</p> \n<p>When the crisis first hit, the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak, announced that businesses would be able to apply for help paying the wages of staff</a> who they would otherwise have been forced to make redundant as the economy stalled.</p> \n<p>Under the job retention scheme, firms would be able to keep people on, even if they were unable to work, and reclaim wages of up to \u00a32,500 a month for each worker.</p> \n<p>Initially the scheme applied to workers who were on their employer\u2019s payroll on 28 February, but on Wednesday the Treasury said the cut-off date would be changed to 19 March. This move, to the day before the scheme was announced, would mean more than 200,000 extra people could qualify, the Treasury said.</p> \n<p>But while the change was welcomed as progress, it does not cover everyone who recently switched firms, or seasonal workers who were about to start posts at holiday parks, airports and youth hostels.</p> \n<p>They have been laid off and will need to apply for universal credit, even though their employers have said they are keen to take them on again when the lockdown ends.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis new date will come as an enormous relief to thousands of people who had been let go, and through horrible bad luck had slipped through the net of the furlough scheme,\u201d says Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, the detail of the change means not everyone employed by 19 March will be brought into the scheme. You also have to have been on your new employer\u2019s payroll \u2013 and HM Revenue &amp; Customs must have been notified of it by this date. If your employer usually notifies HMRC of changes at the end of each month, you would have had to have started by the end of February to qualify.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9980d40c-07e2-4e5a-8ae3-5056907866ee\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Income subsidies</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month.

He says: \u201cI fully support the pledge from Rishi Sunak that nobody will be left behind, but he must now deliver on this. That means putting support in place for new starters.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tami says the Treasury should consider a scheme based on previous earnings, similar to that being offered to the self-employed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe alternative is that a large group of people are thrown on to universal credit or new-style benefits \u2013 if they\u2019re lucky. Given senior cabinet ministers have said that they couldn\u2019t live on statutory sick pay, which is more than these benefits, it seems wrong to expect people unlucky enough to have been caught in the chancellor\u2019s furlough trap to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>The March date has allowed Adrian Mooney, who runs an industrial services company in Belfast, to furlough a new staff member who he had previously told he could not help.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c5433c2888e1c307dcec18a77fb8985b92f9cc7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c5433c2888e1c307dcec18a77fb8985b92f9cc7/0_0_3156_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shopper walks down the usually bustling Oxford Street in central London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shopper walks down the usually bustling Oxford Street in central London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mooney says he is delighted that the chancellor has extended the scheme. \u201cIf he only knew the security and benefit it has brought to our employees and company, it perhaps would give him pause for thought for the other workers and businesses who are still excluded from the scheme through no fault of their own,\u201d he says. \u201cAny post-lockdown recovery will surely be enhanced by having trained and retained staff in place when restrictions are relaxed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has suggested that workers could approach their former employers for help. A spokesperson said: \u201cThey may return to their old employer, but decisions around whether to offer to furlough someone are down to the individual company.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, those who contacted the Guardian said this had not worked for them, even when they had left on good terms. One says her former employer had told her it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to take her back on to their payroll, and others said their previous workplaces had closed down.</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018I was told I would be laid off\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>For the past four years <strong>Barry Wilkinson</strong>, 53, has spent half a year working at the British Antarctic Survey and half a year working in the UK for the Youth Hostels Association. He does not think the change to the date will help him.</p> \n<p>\u201cI come back to the same job every year but it\u2019s a new contract each time,\u201d he says. \u201cI started back at YHA Buttermere in Cumbria on the middle weekend of March and we had one group in. We were due to open properly the next weekend, then it was announced that we would have to close. The furlough scheme was announced on the Thursday \u2026 At first I thought it would cover me, then at the end of the next week they called to say that it wouldn\u2019t, and I would be laid off.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow I\u2019m not sure what happens \u2013 most payrolls are done at the end of the month and it looks like my tax registration was done on 23 March, so I\u2019m not holding out much hope.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can apply for other work, but when there was that flurry of jobs advertised at supermarkets, I didn\u2019t know that was the case, and now there isn\u2019t much about. Both of my employers have been great, and the British Antarctic Survey has offered everyone who was on a contract at the end of February an extra month\u2019s pay, but beyond that there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5954a78e3b4ec6f4893738541846391a0fb702cb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5954a78e3b4ec6f4893738541846391a0fb702cb/0_8_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mist over Buttermere lake in the Lake District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Wilkinson had just started at the YHA hostel at<strong> </strong><br>Buttermere in the Lake District when he was told he would be laid off.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>\u2018</strong>We\u2019ve fallen through the tiniest crack<strong>\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Saffron Coles</strong>, 28, and her husband started work as live-in wardens at a holiday park in Loch Lomond on 25 February, but were not added to their new employer\u2019s payroll in time to qualify, even now that the date has been changed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe cut-off date for the payroll was the 22nd so we were only added in March and received a back payment for the first three days,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey said we could stay in the property, which is a real comfort, and that when they reopen they want us to work here. In the meantime we could apply for work, but we have no car and it\u2019s very rural, so we would need to move out to get something.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to our old employer, and it is supposed to be a job retention scheme, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do so. Our employers want us to stay with them and we want to stay \u2026 We have fallen through the tiniest crack here and we are heartbroken.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m not entitled to anything\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>James Underhill</strong> has been working in the private sector since leaving the forces after 30 years in late 2017. He started a new job with an estate agency on 10 March, the day after finishing his old job, but his employer has told him that he does not qualify.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy employer placed me on furloughed leave along with everybody else, but then I heard from them that because I wasn\u2019t on their payroll in time they would not be able to pay me \u2013 I\u2019m not entitled to anything.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am still employed by the company, so I can\u2019t apply for anything else at the moment. I have too much in savings to qualify for universal credit.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70d1cc39f7f7daf169163d8a8f7a59c041e5a3c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70d1cc39f7f7daf169163d8a8f7a59c041e5a3c7/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gatwick duty-free\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikki Addison hadn\u2019t even started work at Gatwick duty-free when she was told her job would be put on hold.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>\u2018I was told my job offer would be put on hold\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Nikki Addison</strong>, 50, worked for Thomas Cook and lost her cabin crew job when the company folded last year.

They applied for my air-side pass, which involved getting details of my work history from HMRC.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen a couple of weeks ago they called to say that they would have to put my job offer on hold \u2013 the airport is pretty much closed now. I wouldn\u2019t expect to be furloughed until my start date, but the rules mean they wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of my former colleagues are in the same position.

      "bodyText": "Workers who had only just started new jobs before coronavirus hit UK businesses are caught in a \u201cfurlough trap\u201d, with the government scheme to cover 80% of their income unavailable to their employers. When the crisis first hit, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced that businesses would be able to apply for help paying the wages of staff who they would otherwise have been forced to make redundant as the economy stalled. Under the job retention scheme, firms would be able to keep people on, even if they were unable to work, and reclaim wages of up to \u00a32,500 a month for each worker. Initially the scheme applied to workers who were on their employer\u2019s payroll on 28 February, but on Wednesday the Treasury said the cut-off date would be changed to 19 March. This move, to the day before the scheme was announced, would mean more than 200,000 extra people could qualify, the Treasury said. But while the change was welcomed as progress, it does not cover everyone who recently switched firms, or seasonal workers who were about to start posts at holiday parks, airports and youth hostels. They have been laid off and will need to apply for universal credit, even though their employers have said they are keen to take them on again when the lockdown ends. \u201cThis new date will come as an enormous relief to thousands of people who had been let go, and through horrible bad luck had slipped through the net of the furlough scheme,\u201d says Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cUnfortunately, the detail of the change means not everyone employed by 19 March will be brought into the scheme. You also have to have been on your new employer\u2019s payroll \u2013 and HM Revenue &amp; Customs must have been notified of it by this date. If your employer usually notifies HMRC of changes at the end of each month, you would have had to have started by the end of February to qualify.\u201d Some workers who contacted the Guardian to say they did not qualify for the scheme had already worked in their jobs for several weeks but were not yet on the payroll at their new firm. Others were not yet due to start with their new employer but had been told not to turn up for their first day. The change to include more people in the scheme followed a petition, which by Friday had been signed by more than 70,000 people calling for these workers to be considered, and lobbying by MPs around the country on behalf of their constituents. Mark Tami, the Labour MP for Alyn and Deeside, is one who has written to the chancellor. He says: \u201cI fully support the pledge from Rishi Sunak that nobody will be left behind, but he must now deliver on this. That means putting support in place for new starters.\u201d Tami says the Treasury should consider a scheme based on previous earnings, similar to that being offered to the self-employed. \u201cThe alternative is that a large group of people are thrown on to universal credit or new-style benefits \u2013 if they\u2019re lucky. Given senior cabinet ministers have said that they couldn\u2019t live on statutory sick pay, which is more than these benefits, it seems wrong to expect people unlucky enough to have been caught in the chancellor\u2019s furlough trap to do so.\u201d The March date has allowed Adrian Mooney, who runs an industrial services company in Belfast, to furlough a new staff member who he had previously told he could not help. Mooney says he is delighted that the chancellor has extended the scheme. \u201cIf he only knew the security and benefit it has brought to our employees and company, it perhaps would give him pause for thought for the other workers and businesses who are still excluded from the scheme through no fault of their own,\u201d he says. \u201cAny post-lockdown recovery will surely be enhanced by having trained and retained staff in place when restrictions are relaxed.\u201d The government has suggested that workers could approach their former employers for help. A spokesperson said: \u201cThey may return to their old employer, but decisions around whether to offer to furlough someone are down to the individual company.\u201d However, those who contacted the Guardian said this had not worked for them, even when they had left on good terms. One says her former employer had told her it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to take her back on to their payroll, and others said their previous workplaces had closed down. \u2018I was told I would be laid off\u2019 For the past four years Barry Wilkinson, 53, has spent half a year working at the British Antarctic Survey and half a year working in the UK for the Youth Hostels Association. He does not think the change to the date will help him. \u201cI come back to the same job every year but it\u2019s a new contract each time,\u201d he says. \u201cI started back at YHA Buttermere in Cumbria on the middle weekend of March and we had one group in. We were due to open properly the next weekend, then it was announced that we would have to close. The furlough scheme was announced on the Thursday \u2026 At first I thought it would cover me, then at the end of the next week they called to say that it wouldn\u2019t, and I would be laid off. \u201cNow I\u2019m not sure what happens \u2013 most payrolls are done at the end of the month and it looks like my tax registration was done on 23 March, so I\u2019m not holding out much hope. \u201cI can apply for other work, but when there was that flurry of jobs advertised at supermarkets, I didn\u2019t know that was the case, and now there isn\u2019t much about. Both of my employers have been great, and the British Antarctic Survey has offered everyone who was on a contract at the end of February an extra month\u2019s pay, but beyond that there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve fallen through the tiniest crack\u2019 Saffron Coles, 28, and her husband started work as live-in wardens at a holiday park in Loch Lomond on 25 February, but were not added to their new employer\u2019s payroll in time to qualify, even now that the date has been changed. \u201cThe cut-off date for the payroll was the 22nd so we were only added in March and received a back payment for the first three days,\u201d she says. \u201cThey said we could stay in the property, which is a real comfort, and that when they reopen they want us to work here. In the meantime we could apply for work, but we have no car and it\u2019s very rural, so we would need to move out to get something. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to our old employer, and it is supposed to be a job retention scheme, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do so. Our employers want us to stay with them and we want to stay \u2026 We have fallen through the tiniest crack here and we are heartbroken.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m not entitled to anything\u2019 James Underhill has been working in the private sector since leaving the forces after 30 years in late 2017. He started a new job with an estate agency on 10 March, the day after finishing his old job, but his employer has told him that he does not qualify. \u201cMy employer placed me on furloughed leave along with everybody else, but then I heard from them that because I wasn\u2019t on their payroll in time they would not be able to pay me \u2013 I\u2019m not entitled to anything. \u201cI am still employed by the company, so I can\u2019t apply for anything else at the moment. I have too much in savings to qualify for universal credit.\u201d \u2018I was told my job offer would be put on hold\u2019 Nikki Addison, 50, worked for Thomas Cook and lost her cabin crew job when the company folded last year. She was due to start work at Gatwick airport at the start of May so is still ineligible to be furloughed. \u201cI had my interview with Gatwick duty-free in January, was offered the job the same month, and signed my contract and returned it in the first week of February. They applied for my air-side pass, which involved getting details of my work history from HMRC. \u201cThen a couple of weeks ago they called to say that they would have to put my job offer on hold \u2013 the airport is pretty much closed now. I wouldn\u2019t expect to be furloughed until my start date, but the rules mean they wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. \u201cA lot of my former colleagues are in the same position. They may have signed contracts back in December, but work at airlines typically starts at this time of year. We can\u2019t go back to Thomas Cook to help us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong>The year I turned 11, my uncle Josiah Ssesanga was admitted to a hospital in Uganda with meningitis. It was 1994, and he was HIV positive. Between him and death stood a tattered post-civil war health system. </p> <p>Treatments for HIV and Aids existed in other parts of the world, but in Uganda they were mostly limited to those used in clinical trials. For my uncle\u2019s particular infection \u2013 cryptococcal meningitis \u2013 there was a drug called Fluconazole. But he didn\u2019t know it existed; regardless, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. and even among patients who took it, only 12% survived beyond six months.</p> <p>The day after his admission, \u201cpeople from some American project\u201d arrived with a mountain of paperwork, my aunt remembers. They were doing a clinical trial testing a more effective combination therapy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/macron-urges-on-trials-of-controversial-coronavirus-drug\">Macron calls for clinical trials of controversial coronavirus 'cure'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere were about three pages on possible side-effects of the drug. We were also warned that he would need to keep taking the drugs even if the project ended,\u201d my aunt says. \u201cBut for most of us, in that hour, our answer was yes. We were desperate. Anything to stop that pain.\u201d</p> <p>Cryptococcal meningitis causes very severe headaches. These headaches drove uncle Ssesanga out of his mind and he often needed to be physically restrained.</p> <p>Once on the trial, my uncle received a combination of two drugs with rapid results: in under two weeks, he was discharged from inpatient care. In the subsequent months, he completed his university degree and became an inspector of schools. He would return to the hospital to meet researchers and had to endure painful lumbar punctures to track his recovery. </p> <p>However, the clinical trial provided only a few months of therapy beyond the researchers\u2019 initial period of investigation. After that, my uncle was told to start paying for his pills. A week\u2019s supply alone cost more than he earned in a month. He quietly stopped the treatment.</p> <p>About a year later, a researcher came looking for him. She implored my relatives to get him back on treatment. But there was still not enough money. Two years later, he fell seriously ill and died in the harrowing way every Aids patient without access to antiretroviral therapy did.</p> <p>Today my family is proud that my uncle contributed to the development of combination therapy that restored hope and dignity to so many Aids patients globally. But we are still heartbroken that, for him and many other African patients, their contribution to these advances was unmarked and thankless.</p> <p>Now I fear that we will replay this painful script again as we face the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Recently, two French doctors <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP0bfBQ6zzc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">suggested that coronavirus</a> vaccine trials should be done in Africa: the continent with <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">the lowest numbers</a> of confirmed cases so far. Speaking on French TV, one said: \u201cIf I can be provocative, shouldn\u2019t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation?\u201d </p> <p>Given the long history of medical racism and painful experiences like that of my family\u2019s, some Africans were <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/racism-row-french-doctors-suggest-virus-vaccine-test-africa-200404054304466.html\">understandably annoyed</a>, calling these comments racist and akin to treating people as \u201chuman guinea pigs\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52192184\">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</a>, the director general of the World Health Organization, described the doctors\u2019 comments as a hangover from a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d, and said that \u201cAfrica can\u2019t and won\u2019t be a testing ground for any vaccine\u201d.</p> <p>And yet \u2013 as happened with the Aids pandemic \u2013 Africa will certainly be a testbed for some coronavirus therapies, vaccines or contagion controls. It already is. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has, for instance, put out an early \u20ac4.75m call <a href=\"https://www.edctp.org/call/mobilisation-of-funding-for-covid-19-research-in-sub-saharan-africa/\">for research proposals</a> on Covid-19 responses in Africa. And this is actually a good thing.</p> <p>Excluding the continent from ongoing pandemic research is not the answer. Clinical trials can be ethically done \u2013 and many African countries and institutions now have ethics review boards to oversee this research.</p> <p>The injustice is in how geopolitical power imbalances, through patent law, ration access to the drugs that come out of successful trials.<strong> </strong>In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and Aids that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/markschoofs/how-to-survive-yet-another-plague\">a watershed moment for US activists</a> (many of them marginalised gay men).</p> <p>But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies.

      "bodyText": "The year I turned 11, my uncle Josiah Ssesanga was admitted to a hospital in Uganda with meningitis. It was 1994, and he was HIV positive. Between him and death stood a tattered post-civil war health system. Treatments for HIV and Aids existed in other parts of the world, but in Uganda they were mostly limited to those used in clinical trials. For my uncle\u2019s particular infection \u2013 cryptococcal meningitis \u2013 there was a drug called Fluconazole. But he didn\u2019t know it existed; regardless, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. and even among patients who took it, only 12% survived beyond six months. The day after his admission, \u201cpeople from some American project\u201d arrived with a mountain of paperwork, my aunt remembers. They were doing a clinical trial testing a more effective combination therapy. \u201cThere were about three pages on possible side-effects of the drug. We were also warned that he would need to keep taking the drugs even if the project ended,\u201d my aunt says. \u201cBut for most of us, in that hour, our answer was yes. We were desperate. Anything to stop that pain.\u201d Cryptococcal meningitis causes very severe headaches. These headaches drove uncle Ssesanga out of his mind and he often needed to be physically restrained. Once on the trial, my uncle received a combination of two drugs with rapid results: in under two weeks, he was discharged from inpatient care. In the subsequent months, he completed his university degree and became an inspector of schools. He would return to the hospital to meet researchers and had to endure painful lumbar punctures to track his recovery. However, the clinical trial provided only a few months of therapy beyond the researchers\u2019 initial period of investigation. After that, my uncle was told to start paying for his pills. A week\u2019s supply alone cost more than he earned in a month. He quietly stopped the treatment. About a year later, a researcher came looking for him. She implored my relatives to get him back on treatment. But there was still not enough money. Two years later, he fell seriously ill and died in the harrowing way every Aids patient without access to antiretroviral therapy did. Today my family is proud that my uncle contributed to the development of combination therapy that restored hope and dignity to so many Aids patients globally. But we are still heartbroken that, for him and many other African patients, their contribution to these advances was unmarked and thankless. Now I fear that we will replay this painful script again as we face the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, two French doctors suggested that coronavirus vaccine trials should be done in Africa: the continent with the lowest numbers of confirmed cases so far. Speaking on French TV, one said: \u201cIf I can be provocative, shouldn\u2019t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation?\u201d Given the long history of medical racism and painful experiences like that of my family\u2019s, some Africans were understandably annoyed, calling these comments racist and akin to treating people as \u201chuman guinea pigs\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, described the doctors\u2019 comments as a hangover from a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d, and said that \u201cAfrica can\u2019t and won\u2019t be a testing ground for any vaccine\u201d. And yet \u2013 as happened with the Aids pandemic \u2013 Africa will certainly be a testbed for some coronavirus therapies, vaccines or contagion controls. It already is. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has, for instance, put out an early \u20ac4.75m call for research proposals on Covid-19 responses in Africa. And this is actually a good thing. Excluding the continent from ongoing pandemic research is not the answer. Clinical trials can be ethically done \u2013 and many African countries and institutions now have ethics review boards to oversee this research. The injustice is in how geopolitical power imbalances, through patent law, ration access to the drugs that come out of successful trials. In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and Aids that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was a watershed moment for US activists (many of them marginalised gay men). But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies. For years, with the cover of western patent laws, drug companies priced medicines out of their reach. By 2000, when India\u2019s Cipla Pharmaceuticals defied these patents to produce generic Aids drugs that countries in the global south could afford to purchase for their citizens, my uncle was long dead. The WHO\u2019s declaration that Africa won\u2019t be a testing ground for coronavirus vaccines ultimately overlooks a much bigger problem. What we really need is assurance that Africa will get any vaccine or treatment at the same time as any other region; and on terms which mean we can actually afford it. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has stated that governments must \u201cprepare to suspend and override patents\u201d. Warning that companies might try to \u201cprofiteer\u201d from Covid-19, M\u00e1rcio da Fonseca, an MSF infectious disease adviser, has urged governments to \u201cset the wheels in motion to override [patent] monopolies, so they can ensure the supply of affordable drugs and save more lives\u201d.

His latest comment doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d Kazimba\u2019s comments have not been universally accepted by other members of the Christian community. \u201cThat is his [Kazimba\u2019s] view. It\u2019s immoral to do that. The stand of the Catholic church is clear. No artificial use of contraception,\u201d said John Baptist Odama, archbishop of the Gulu archdiocese. \u201cWe don\u2019t support any form of modern family planning methods. They are not right. It\u2019s unacceptable. Let them [women] learn to follow their cycles. Let them use natural family planning and spacing of children, which will not interfere with their [birth] systems and will not cause harm.\u201d Russell added that before the outbreak, Ugandan women were facing \u201ctremendous barriers\u201d to access safe, quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services. \u201cThe government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown policies are twisting the knife in, leading to new crises. There has been a massive and egregious failure by the government to protect pregnant women who need health care services,\u201d said Russell. Civil society is calling on the government to declare a blanket exemption on the travel ban for pregnant women, so they can seek proper obstetric care and prevent avoidable maternal deaths.",

But the figures are not universally bleak. In some states, including California, the infection and death rates appear comparatively low for Latinos. Though Latinos make up 39% of California\u2019s population, they account for <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx\">30% </a>of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>Still, public health experts warn that the official statistics may be underestimating the virus\u2019s toll on Latino communities wary of seeking medical care due to a lack of health insurance, and in many cases fear that going to a hospital will expose them to immigration authorities.</p> <p>\u201cI would put lots of grains of salt on these figures,\u201d said David Hayes-Bautista, who directs the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the UCLA School of Medicine. \u201cThink about who had access to the testing, and who\u2019s getting into the hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>The disparities boil down to differences not only in race but also in income and access, Hayes-Bautista said. \u201cThe problems aren\u2019t genetic,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey are structural.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4a437a230580cec812086ce6770f2740cca6bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a437a230580cec812086ce6770f2740cca6bac/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmworkers clean a carrot field in Arvin, California, during the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmworkers clean a carrot field in Arvin, California, during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Economic disparities, health vulnurabilities</h2> <p>With the exception of diabetes, Latinos on average have lower rates of heart disease, cancers, hypertension and other underlying conditions that make people especially vulnerable to Covid-19, Hayes-Bautista noted. But Latinos make up a large proportion of what is now considered the \u201cessential\u201d workforce of grocery store staff, restaurant workers, caretakers, cleaners and delivery workers, and are putting themselves at the frontlines of the pandemic.</p> <p>Christian Zamarron, whose family is from Mexico, works part-time in an Amazon warehouse in Chicago where he makes $15 an hour. Amazon promised workers an extra $2 an hour for working during the pandemic. But like his part-time colleagues, Zamarron doesn\u2019t get health insurance. Instead, Amazon provides $9 extra a week in \u201chealth pay\u201d that can go toward health care costs.</p> <p>\u201cMy bills haven\u2019t stopped, so I have to keep going,\u201d Zamarron said. \u201cI need the money, but I\u2019m there to speak up for my co-workers. A lot of the stuff that we\u2019re moving isn\u2019t even essential goods. This is reckless endangerment of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>For many Latinos, the economic fallout from the pandemic is just as worrying as the health risks, leaving many with little choice but to risk their lives at frontline jobs. But unemployment has also disproportionately affected Latinos. Compared to the overall US population, Latinos disproportionately say that they or someone in their household has taken a pay cut, lost a job or both since the pandemic hit, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/03/u-s-latinos-among-hardest-hit-by-pay-cuts-job-losses-due-to-coronavirus/\">a recent report</a> from the Pew Research Center.</p> <p>For Rafaela Berry and her mom, Brazilian immigrants now living in Atlanta, coronavirus is already slashing income. Berry works as a nanny and in the past has helped her mom clean houses. In recent weeks, more and more of their clients have cancelled cleanings, she said, either because they\u2019ve been laid off, or out of concern that a visitor could bring the virus into the house. They used to clean four or five houses a day. Now there\u2019s one house to clean every four days.</p> <p>To get by, Berry\u2019s mom began selling $5 masks she sewed herself. For Berry, it\u2019s impossible to separate the health risks from the economic toll the virus could take.</p> <p>\u201cThe sickness is scary, but not so much for the health risks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one of us gets sick and goes to the hospital, we\u2019ll have medical bills. But we also won\u2019t be able to make money to pay them off.\u201d</p> <p>With economic disparities layered upon health disparities, the Latino workers who most need access to health insurance and government benefits are least able to access it. Latinos have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group in the US. And only 38% of Latinos working low-wage jobs have access to health coverage, according to a <a href=\"https://www.mijentesupportcommittee.com/post/report-release-covid-19-and-the-impact-on-latinos-in-the-u-s\">report</a> from Mijente and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, published Thursday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"719eeff9dad8ea86e99733e404937b98d4df11e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/719eeff9dad8ea86e99733e404937b98d4df11e8/0_207_5393_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juana, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador and her husband Saul, from Honduras, both lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juana, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador and her husband Saul, from Honduras, both lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Governments discriminate\u2019</h2> <p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/i-have-a-broken-heart-trump-policy-has-immigrants-backing-away-from-healthcare-amid-crisis\">Trump administration policies</a> discouraging Latino immigrants from making use of public health insurance and government benefits such as food stamps \u2013 as well as the continuation of immigration enforcement \u2013 even as Covid-19 spread through the country, has ratcheted up the fear that asking for assistance could land them on the radar of immigration officials or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/14/will-they-take-my-kids-away-the-immigrants-refusing-food-aid-amid-trump-crackdown\">separate them from their children</a>.</p> <p>At Massachusetts General in Boston, medical staff are trying to \u201chammer the message in our Latino communities that it\u2019s safe to get tested, it\u2019s safe to get care\u201d, said Dr Joseph Betancourt, the vice-president and chief equity and inclusion officer at the hospital. \u201cBut of course there\u2019s still mistrust. Of course people are hesitant.\u201d And despite the hesitance to get care, it\u2019s clear that Latinos are being disproportionately infected, Betancourt noted; they make up 35% to 40% of coronavirus patients each week, even though normally, only about 9% of the patients at Mass General are Latino.</p> <p>\u201cThe last four years have been very, very heavy,\u201d said Luz Gallegos, director of the Todec legal center in California\u2019s Coachella valley. Gallegos, whose uncle died on 31 March of complications from Covid-19, said for a community that has \u201cbeen overwhelmed with attacks from the government, every day, with every tweet, the coronavirus is just adding to our trauma\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec8e557c574b25571da0bc28b04f18537c3538ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec8e557c574b25571da0bc28b04f18537c3538ed/0_16_5254_3155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Mendez organizes food boxes to send to minorities in need during the Covid-19 lockdown in Garden City, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Mendez organizes food boxes to send to minorities in need during the Covid-19 lockdown in Garden City, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gallegos hasn\u2019t been able to properly mourn her uncle\u2019s death \u2013 not only because she and her family weren\u2019t able to hold him and comfort him in his last moments, or see his body after he died, but also she has been working nonstop to help anxious community members, who are calling into Todec\u2019s hotline at \u201c3, 4 or even 5 in the morning\u201d, she said. \u201cWhen we answer the calls, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be OK. But we\u2019re trying to lift their spirits, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Latinos make up almost three-quarters of the estimated 10.5m undocumented people living in the US. Although they commonly have taxes deducted from paychecks, undocumented people typically cannot benefit from unemployment assistance. Nor will they see the stimulus checks of up $1,200 that many Americans will receive.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t discriminate. But governments do,\u201d said Leticia Casildo, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras living in New Orleans, who has spent recent weeks delivering food to immigrant families as part of her organizing role with the nonprofit Familias Unidas en Acci\u00f3n.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately people don\u2019t see us as worth saving,\u201d Casildo said in Spanish. \u201cThe good thing about the undocumented community is that we\u2019re used to creating our own reality and finding ways to take care of each other.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates urging lawmakers to step in have made some headway. This week California governor Gavin Newsom announced $125m in relief to the state\u2019s undocumented residents. While leaders <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/491572-chicago-mayor-signs-order-ensuring-immigrants-and-refugees-have-access\">in Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/262-20/mayor-de-blasio-new-york-city-covid-19-immigrant-emergency-relief-program-open\">New York City</a> have created relief programs for immigrants and refugees, California alone promises help statewide.</p> <p>\u201cEvery Californian, including our undocumented neighbors and friends, should know that California is here to support them during this crisis,\u201d Newsom said when he <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/15/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-support-california-workers-impacted-by-covid-19/\">announced the</a> policy. But the aid, which will provide $1,000 to about 150,000 families, will reach only a fraction of the estimated 2m undocumented immigrants living in California.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72d9c7bf67dc86ab242d587014ed3ec575c734f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72d9c7bf67dc86ab242d587014ed3ec575c734f8/0_0_5000_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Day laborers and supporters take part in a demonstration in Los Angeles to demand that undocumented workers receive emergency financial aid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Day laborers and supporters take part in a demonstration in Los Angeles to demand that undocumented workers receive emergency financial aid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is obviously a historic development,\u201d said Christian Arana, policy director at the Latino Community Foundation in San Francisco. \u201cBut $125m is just a drop in the bucket in terms of need,\u201d he said, adding that $1,000 won\u2019t cover a month of rent in many areas of the state.</p> <p>Iliana Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, programs manager at Nuestra Casa, a social service agency in California\u2019s Bay Area, said the need is stretching their food bank program and that demand has doubled since the outbreak started.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re probably most fearful of the repercussions for the future and how families are going to recover,\u201d said Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, with many of the agency\u2019s clients burning through their modest savings to eat and pay bills in one of the nation\u2019s most expensive regions.</p> <p>Still, despite all the pain, Todec\u2019s Gallegos said she sees the crisis as \u201ca sign of God\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur immigrant community, our undocumented community has always been essential,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for all of us, our governments and lawmakers to show compassion and take care of the communities that have put themselves on this line.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Latinos across the US are disproportionately getting sick from coronavirus, in some regions being infected and hospitalized at up to three times the rate of white Americans, a Guardian analysis found. And the Latino communities that are worst hit by the crisis are among the least able to access the healthcare systems and unemployment benefits that could bring relief. New data trickling out of cities and states are making increasingly clear the virus\u2019s unequal toll on minorities. In New York City, data has shown that Covid-19 is killing Latino people at 1.6 times the rate that it is killing white people. In Utah, Latinos are being infected and hospitalized at three times the rate of white people. Whereas Latinos make up 14% of the state\u2019s population, 29% of the patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in the state identified as Latino. In Oregon, Latinos accounted for 22% of coronavirus cases where demographic information was available. Latinos make up 13% of Oregon\u2019s population. In New Jersey, Latinos make up 19% of the population, but nearly 30% of Covid-19 patients in that state identified as Hispanic. In Washington state, 25% of those infected are Latino while they make up only 13% of the state\u2019s total population. Several states have not reported the racial breakdown of confirmed cases, and those that have are often offering limited and preliminary numbers. But the figures are not universally bleak. In some states, including California, the infection and death rates appear comparatively low for Latinos. Though Latinos make up 39% of California\u2019s population, they account for 30% of Covid-19 deaths. Still, public health experts warn that the official statistics may be underestimating the virus\u2019s toll on Latino communities wary of seeking medical care due to a lack of health insurance, and in many cases fear that going to a hospital will expose them to immigration authorities. \u201cI would put lots of grains of salt on these figures,\u201d said David Hayes-Bautista, who directs the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the UCLA School of Medicine. \u201cThink about who had access to the testing, and who\u2019s getting into the hospitals.\u201d The disparities boil down to differences not only in race but also in income and access, Hayes-Bautista said. \u201cThe problems aren\u2019t genetic,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey are structural.\u201d Economic disparities, health vulnurabilities With the exception of diabetes, Latinos on average have lower rates of heart disease, cancers, hypertension and other underlying conditions that make people especially vulnerable to Covid-19, Hayes-Bautista noted. But Latinos make up a large proportion of what is now considered the \u201cessential\u201d workforce of grocery store staff, restaurant workers, caretakers, cleaners and delivery workers, and are putting themselves at the frontlines of the pandemic. Christian Zamarron, whose family is from Mexico, works part-time in an Amazon warehouse in Chicago where he makes $15 an hour. Amazon promised workers an extra $2 an hour for working during the pandemic. But like his part-time colleagues, Zamarron doesn\u2019t get health insurance. Instead, Amazon provides $9 extra a week in \u201chealth pay\u201d that can go toward health care costs. \u201cMy bills haven\u2019t stopped, so I have to keep going,\u201d Zamarron said. \u201cI need the money, but I\u2019m there to speak up for my co-workers. A lot of the stuff that we\u2019re moving isn\u2019t even essential goods. This is reckless endangerment of their lives.\u201d For many Latinos, the economic fallout from the pandemic is just as worrying as the health risks, leaving many with little choice but to risk their lives at frontline jobs. But unemployment has also disproportionately affected Latinos. Compared to the overall US population, Latinos disproportionately say that they or someone in their household has taken a pay cut, lost a job or both since the pandemic hit, according to a recent report from the Pew Research Center. For Rafaela Berry and her mom, Brazilian immigrants now living in Atlanta, coronavirus is already slashing income. Berry works as a nanny and in the past has helped her mom clean houses. In recent weeks, more and more of their clients have cancelled cleanings, she said, either because they\u2019ve been laid off, or out of concern that a visitor could bring the virus into the house. They used to clean four or five houses a day. Now there\u2019s one house to clean every four days. To get by, Berry\u2019s mom began selling $5 masks she sewed herself. For Berry, it\u2019s impossible to separate the health risks from the economic toll the virus could take. \u201cThe sickness is scary, but not so much for the health risks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one of us gets sick and goes to the hospital, we\u2019ll have medical bills. But we also won\u2019t be able to make money to pay them off.\u201d With economic disparities layered upon health disparities, the Latino workers who most need access to health insurance and government benefits are least able to access it. Latinos have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group in the US. And only 38% of Latinos working low-wage jobs have access to health coverage, according to a report from Mijente and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, published Thursday. \u2018Governments discriminate\u2019 Moreover, the Trump administration policies discouraging Latino immigrants from making use of public health insurance and government benefits such as food stamps \u2013 as well as the continuation of immigration enforcement \u2013 even as Covid-19 spread through the country, has ratcheted up the fear that asking for assistance could land them on the radar of immigration officials or even separate them from their children. At Massachusetts General in Boston, medical staff are trying to \u201chammer the message in our Latino communities that it\u2019s safe to get tested, it\u2019s safe to get care\u201d, said Dr Joseph Betancourt, the vice-president and chief equity and inclusion officer at the hospital. \u201cBut of course there\u2019s still mistrust. Of course people are hesitant.\u201d And despite the hesitance to get care, it\u2019s clear that Latinos are being disproportionately infected, Betancourt noted; they make up 35% to 40% of coronavirus patients each week, even though normally, only about 9% of the patients at Mass General are Latino. \u201cThe last four years have been very, very heavy,\u201d said Luz Gallegos, director of the Todec legal center in California\u2019s Coachella valley. Gallegos, whose uncle died on 31 March of complications from Covid-19, said for a community that has \u201cbeen overwhelmed with attacks from the government, every day, with every tweet, the coronavirus is just adding to our trauma\u201d. Gallegos hasn\u2019t been able to properly mourn her uncle\u2019s death \u2013 not only because she and her family weren\u2019t able to hold him and comfort him in his last moments, or see his body after he died, but also she has been working nonstop to help anxious community members, who are calling into Todec\u2019s hotline at \u201c3, 4 or even 5 in the morning\u201d, she said. \u201cWhen we answer the calls, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be OK. But we\u2019re trying to lift their spirits, anyway.\u201d Latinos make up almost three-quarters of the estimated 10.5m undocumented people living in the US. Although they commonly have taxes deducted from paychecks, undocumented people typically cannot benefit from unemployment assistance. Nor will they see the stimulus checks of up $1,200 that many Americans will receive. \u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t discriminate. But governments do,\u201d said Leticia Casildo, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras living in New Orleans, who has spent recent weeks delivering food to immigrant families as part of her organizing role with the nonprofit Familias Unidas en Acci\u00f3n. \u201cUnfortunately people don\u2019t see us as worth saving,\u201d Casildo said in Spanish. \u201cThe good thing about the undocumented community is that we\u2019re used to creating our own reality and finding ways to take care of each other.\u201d Advocates urging lawmakers to step in have made some headway. This week California governor Gavin Newsom announced $125m in relief to the state\u2019s undocumented residents. While leaders in Chicago and New York City have created relief programs for immigrants and refugees, California alone promises help statewide. \u201cEvery Californian, including our undocumented neighbors and friends, should know that California is here to support them during this crisis,\u201d Newsom said when he announced the policy. But the aid, which will provide $1,000 to about 150,000 families, will reach only a fraction of the estimated 2m undocumented immigrants living in California. \u201cThis is obviously a historic development,\u201d said Christian Arana, policy director at the Latino Community Foundation in San Francisco. \u201cBut $125m is just a drop in the bucket in terms of need,\u201d he said, adding that $1,000 won\u2019t cover a month of rent in many areas of the state. Iliana Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, programs manager at Nuestra Casa, a social service agency in California\u2019s Bay Area, said the need is stretching their food bank program and that demand has doubled since the outbreak started. \u201cWe\u2019re probably most fearful of the repercussions for the future and how families are going to recover,\u201d said Garc\u00eda-Ruiz, with many of the agency\u2019s clients burning through their modest savings to eat and pay bills in one of the nation\u2019s most expensive regions. Still, despite all the pain, Todec\u2019s Gallegos said she sees the crisis as \u201ca sign of God\u201d. \u201cOur immigrant community, our undocumented community has always been essential,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for all of us, our governments and lawmakers to show compassion and take care of the communities that have put themselves on this line.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Thursday evening, Donald Trump took to the dais in the White House press briefing room and declared that he was leading America in a \u201chistoric battle against the invisible enemy\u201d that amounted to the \u201cgreatest national mobilisation since world war two\u201d. Warming to his theme, the US president said the country was now ready to move to the next phase in the war against coronavirus. It was time, he said, \u201cto open up. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open\u201d. Unveiling new guidelines for the loosening of the lockdown, he committed his administration to a \u201cscience-based reopening\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are starting our life again, we are starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.\u201d Beyond the cloistered confines of the White House an alternative interpretation of events was gathering force. On a day in which the US suffered its highest death toll from Covid-19, with a total of more than 680,000 confirmed cases and 34,000 deaths, public health experts were scrutinising the president\u2019s new guidelines and coming to rather different conclusions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a plan, it\u2019s barely a PowerPoint,\u201d spluttered Ron Klain on Twitter. Klain, the US government\u2019s Ebola tsar during the last health crisis to test the White House, in 2014, said the proposals contained \u201cno provision to ramp up testing, no standard on levels of disease before opening, no protections for workers or customers\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 On 28 March the Guardian exposed the missing six weeks lost as a result of Trump\u2019s dithering and downplaying of the crisis when the virus first struck. Jeremy Konyndyk, another central figure in the US battle against Ebola, told the Guardian that the Trump administration\u2019s initial response was \u201cone of the greatest failures of basic governance and leadership in modern times\u201d. Now that the US is contemplating a shift into the second phase of the crisis \u2013 a tentative reopening of the economy \u2013 scientists and public health officials are agreed that three pillars need to be put into place to manage the transition safely. They are: mass testing to identify those who are infected, contact tracing to isolate other people who may have caught Covid-19 from them, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield frontline healthcare workers from any flare-up. A chorus of expert voices has also begun to be heard warning that those three essential pillars remain in critically short supply throughout the US. Less than a month after the Guardian\u2019s exploration of the missing six weeks, the chilling recognition is dawning that the country is heading for a second massive failure of governance under Trump, this time on an even bigger scale. Unless testing capability is dramatically ramped up and a giant army of health workers assembled to trace the contacts of those infected \u2013 right now \u2013 the consequences could be devastating. \u201cI\u2019m fearful,\u201d said Dr Tom Frieden, the former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u201cTesting remains scarce in many parts of the country and it\u2019s slow to scale up \u2013 we are weeks if not months away from having enough test capacity.\u201d Frieden, who now heads the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, told the Guardian in an interview conducted shortly before Trump released the new reopening guidelines that time was being wasted. The federal government\u2019s misplaced insistence in February that its China travel ban would be enough to make the virus go away had \u201clost precious weeks\u201d in tackling the first wave of coronavirus. Now, as the US contemplates reopening, Frieden said he was afraid a repeat performance was imminent. \u201cI fear there\u2019s an analogous mistaken belief that sheltering in place will make this virus go away, that we can then choose a date and all come out. It\u2019s not about the date, it\u2019s about data and building a national response at scale.\u201d In a series of tweets posted in reaction to the new White House guidelines, Konyndyk echoed the anxiety about more lost weeks. He said the Trump administration had \u201cwasted February, and the White House guidance on \u2018opening up\u2019 leaves me worried that we\u2019re about to waste April too\u201d. Konyndyk said that for states to reopen before they were ready \u201cwould be a disaster. It\u2019s no great insight to say we need more testing, tracing, PPE [protective gear for health workers] \u2013 it\u2019s been obvious for a month and a half. But each of those face huge bottlenecks and the document doesn\u2019t acknowledge them, much less propose how to resolve them.\u201d Trump, launching the new reopening guidelines on Thursday, insisted that the US was in \u201cexcellent shape\u201d on testing. \u201cWe have great tests. We have done more testing now than any country, in the world, by far.\u201d The US has so far tested about 3.3 million people, about 1% of its population. Per capita, that is small compared with several countries including Germany and South Korea. Iceland has tested people at 10 times the US rate. \u201cTesting has been an unnecessary disaster,\u201d said Michael Greenberger, director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. \u201cTrump says we have the best testing, but the US is in the last percentage of tests administered to its population.\u201d Not one of the 50 states is currently in a position to carry out tracking of Covid-19 infections on the scale needed, whatever Trump said about their readiness to reopen. Many states, including the hardest hit, New York, are still experiencing testing shortages, 12 weeks after the first US case was recorded. Individual states continue to have to compete for critical supplies against each other, and against the federal government, driving up prices. Components including nasal swabs, reagents and RNA extraction kits are running short. Daily testing has flattened out and is now hovering around 150,000 tests a day \u2013 vastly below the level that would be needed to detect localized pockets of disease as the economy reopens. Most alarmingly, the number of tests carried out by commercial labs has actually plummeted in recent days due to shortages in test samples, leaving the labs sitting idle. At the White House briefing, Trump insisted that the phenomenon of the idle labs was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d, a sign that states were finding local solutions and an \u201caffirmation that testing is growing at a historic rate\u201d. All of these impediments have put the US on the back foot as it seeks to pull off the daunting feat of getting back to work without risking a renewed surge of contagion. \u201cWe have had cases circulating in communities undetected for several weeks, and because of the delay in the roll-out of testing we never had the chance to be on top of it,\u201d said Anita Cicero. She is joint author of one of the most definitive scientific plans for reopening the US, produced by a team from the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat means it\u2019s going to require much more ubiquitous testing,\u201d she said. Estimates vary on how much testing will be needed, but they are all substantially greater than present provision. Even at the lower end, as posited by the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb, some 2m to 3m tests a week are recommended \u2013 up to three times the current level. Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics argues that is too few. It calls for tens of millions of tests every day, way beyond existing capacity. As the Johns Hopkins plan makes clear, diagnostic testing is only the start. It must be combined with relentless detective work, called \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, to track down anyone who has come into contact with an infected person and who may need quarantining to stop the virus spreading again. The Johns Hopkins plan envisages a nationwide army of 100,000 contact tracers. \u201cThat might sound eye-popping, but it\u2019s reasonable and may be a low estimate,\u201d Cicero said, pointing out that in Wuhan, China, the authorities employed a workforce three times the size per capita. With contact tracing, too, there is no sign that Trump recognizes the urgency of the moment. Frieden told the Guardian that many states were already struggling to ramp up contact tracing to a level that would support reopening. Health departments are overwhelmed, and some have \u201ctrouble even conceiving the scale of operations they are going to need\u201d, he said. Faced with a wide gap between nationwide demand for testing and contact tracing and insufficient supply, Trump has flip-flopped in his positions. He began by insisting that he had \u201cabsolute authority\u201d to overrule the states in deciding when to reopen, a posture widely denounced as king-like and anti-American. On Thursday he effected an about-turn and passed the buck to the 50 states. \u201cYou are going to call your own shots,\u201d he told governors on a call on Thursday. Trump\u2019s sudden switch to offloading federal responsibility to the 50 states has prompted questions about his motive. Current and former senior officials in the Trump administration told the Washington Post that he wanted to \u201cshield himself from blame should there be new outbreaks after states reopen\u201d. The former head of Medicare and Medicaid from 2015 to 2017, Andy Slavitt, commented on Twitter that the White House guidelines were sending a clear message to the states: \u201cYour state didn\u2019t open, that\u2019s on your governor. Your state opened and people died, that\u2019s on your governor.\u201d Trump attempted to sell the idea of devolving responsibility by presenting his vision of America as a \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d. He said: \u201cI call it a beautiful puzzle. You have 50 pieces. All very different. But when it\u2019s done \u2026 a very beautiful picture.\u201d A \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d may be an appealing concept to the incumbent of the Oval Office in an election year. But it fits uncomfortably with a virus that is highly contagious, relatively deadly, and dismissive of state boundaries. \u201cThe states are not islands, their borders are not closed and they do not have water around them,\u201d Cicero said. \u201cSo it will be a bumpy road going forward in terms of managing the virus.\u201d States still held in the grip of the contagion, such as New York, are finding it difficult to accept the idea that the buck stops with them in a country with the most powerful national government on Earth. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to do more to help. \u201cI understand that the federal government\u2019s not eager to get involved in testing. But the plain reality here is we have to do it in partnership,\u201d he said on Thursday. At Trump\u2019s disposal is the formidable wartime power of the Defense Production Act, which allows the administration to order corporations to redirect their efforts to the cause of fighting Covid-19. So far the president has deployed this capability only sparingly. The president said there were 29 states which are in \u201cextremely good shape\u201d and could reopen soon, some \u201cliterally tomorrow\u201d. He declined to name them, though it has been reported that several Republican governors are champing at the bit to loosen lockdowns. Florida, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi are at the head of the line, according to Axios. Florida began to reopen its beaches on Friday, a controversial move given that the late closure of its beaches during spring break helped spread Covid-19 across the US. The danger of Trump\u2019s \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d approach is illustrated by New York City, where the death toll is heartwrenching. The probable tally of deaths from Covid-19 in the city now stands at more than 11,000 \u2013 more than double the normal monthly loss of life from all other causes. \u201cI\u2019m moved and crushed by what\u2019s happening in New York right now,\u201d said Frieden, who until 2009 was the city\u2019s health commissioner.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people are preparing to attend protests across the US in the coming days, as a rightwing movement against stay-at-home orders, backed by wealthy conservative groups and promoted by Donald Trump, continues to take hold. Conservative activists are demanding governors lift orders designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, despite the recommendations of public health officials. Trump, who has clashed with Democratic governors over how soon to reopen the US economy, tweeted his support on Friday, in an unprecedented endorsement of civil disobedience by a sitting president. Many of the planned rallies have been inspired by a protest at the Michigan state capitol on Wednesday, which was attended by thousands. Yet while organisers claim the protests are grassroots- and people-driven, a closer look reveals a movement driven by traditional rightwing groups, including one funded by the family of Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. The rallies have drawn comparisons to the Tea Party movement, which sprang into life in 2009 following the election of Barack Obama and was driven in part by Americans for Prosperity, a group founded by rightwing donors Charles and David Koch. As with the Tea Party, the anti-stay-at-home movement has been promoted by a rightwing media eager for the economy to reopen, including Fox News which on Friday aired a segment on protests in Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota. Two minutes later, Trump tweeted to his 77.4 million followers the need to \u201cliberate\u201d those states. A majority of Americans support the lockdowns, with a Pew Research Center poll finding that 66% are concerned state governments will lift restrictions on public activity too quickly. But protests, helped by media coverage, have spread around the country. The two groups behind the \u201coperation gridlock\u201d rally in Michigan on Wednesday have ties to the Republican party and the Trump administration. The Michigan Freedom Fund, which said it was a co-host of the rally, has received more than $500,000 from the DeVos family, regular donors to rightwing groups. The other host, the Michigan Conservative Coalition, was founded by Matt Maddock, now a Republican member of the state house of representatives. The MCC also operates under the name Michigan Trump Republicans, and in January held an event featuring several members of the Trump campaign. \u201cAbsolutely the Michigan event was a huge inspiration and it was a huge success,\u201d said Evie Harris, organizer of a ReOpen Maryland protest planned for the state capitol on Saturday. \u201cThat was the model for our event.\u201d Thousands drove to the Michigan state capitol in Lansing, while the Michigan Freedom Fund purchased Facebook advertising to promote the rally. Protesters, many waving Trump campaign signs, honked their horns and chanted for Governor Gretchen Whitmer to end the stay-at-home rules. The protest was covered exhaustively by the rightwing media. Harris said her Facebook following grew from \u201c700-800 people\u201d to more than 15,000 members following the Michigan rally, inspiring her to organize \u201cOperation Gridlock Annapolis\u201d for Saturday. Harris said her group had support from some elected officials in Maryland, but declined to name them. While ReOpen Maryland might not have funding from rightwing advocacy groups, it appears to be linked to at least four other \u201creopen\u201d organizations. \u201cGovernment mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine,\u201d ReOpen Maryland said. \u201cHowever, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny.\u201d That text is identical to text on Facebook pages calling for rallies in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia. ReOpen Virginia aims to hold its own \u201cgridlock\u201d rally on Wednesday \u2013 again inspired by the conservative-funded Michigan event. Despite ReOpen Virginia billing itself as a \u201cgrassroots group of people and small business owners\u201d, founder Kristen Lynne Hall said the idea for the protest came from the organizers of the \u201cLobby Day\u201d demonstration earlier this year. That demonstration was organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group that has donated tens of thousands of dollars to politicians. Hall, who said Candace Owens, a rightwing activist and favorite of Trump, had been in touch to discuss the event, said the president\u2019s tweet about \u201cliberating\u201d Virginia was \u201cgreat\u201d. \u201cIt could be spreading the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cAny support is appreciated right now.\u201d A decade ago, the Tea Party movement billed itself as \u201cgrass roots\u201d, despite receiving money from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity and the conservative organization FreedomWorks. Jenny Beth Martin, who founded the Tea Party Patriots group, promoted this week\u2019s Michigan protest. The Tea Party Patriots also supported the protest, in messages to its 200,000 Twitter followers. Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, said the similarities between the Tea Party and ReOpen movements went further, with rightwing media boosting both. Fox News ran favorable coverage of the Michigan rally and hosts including Laura Ingraham and Jeanine Pirro endorsed the protest. \u201cFox gave the Tea Party a phenomenal amount of attention and promotion,\u201d Gertz said. \u201cIt really sort of boot-strapped it to another level, and made it a political force, and we see something similar happening with these anti-stay-at-home order movements.\u201d Gertz said he was not \u201csimply\u201d concerned with \u201cthe conservatives having a strong election the next time out\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a real chance for devastating consequences with regard to the coronavirus,\u201d he said.",

As Spain\u2019s confinement stretches past five weeks, Ada Colau has watched her two children, aged nine and three, wilt under the pressure of life in lockdown. \u201cWeek after week, they fight with each other more and more.

In the third week, the show will revisit significant annual traditions in the Ambridge calendar, such as Stir Up Sunday and the annual flower and produce show.

But there was nothing inevitable about that transformation. It happened because people such as William Caburn exploited the crisis.</p> <p>Two years after the plague hit England, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-aRYk3mRD3wC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=Lincolnshire+ploughman+William+Caburn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZclechTEaY&amp;sig=ACfU3U1oSyBqJAmVWmJwEOLZqP5_hZuZ0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjT67mIu-3oAhUjUBUIHfXDBtUQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lincolnshire%20ploughman%20William%20Caburn&amp;f=false\">this Lincolnshire ploughman</a> was in court for \u201crefusing to work at the daily rate\u201d. He had no legal right to do so, but leveraging the fact that landlords didn\u2019t have enough workers to cultivate the land, he bartered for higher wages.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just wages \u2013 peasants also collectively bargained for lower rents. We see in the accounts of one landlord how, in the several villages dotted across his Warwickshire estate, most tenants suddenly went into arrears at the same time. Almost certainly they were secretly communicating and cooperating.</p> <p>Local protests and uprisings against landlords had happened before, but after the Black Death they became more common. The <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item132518.html\">Peasants\u2019 Revolt</a><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item132518.html\"> of 1381</a> was the biggest, but it was an overreach and was defeated. The ruling aristocracy resisted the peasants\u2019 demands from the outset. Brutal new laws tried to stop labourers asking for better pay, and even specified what kind of fabrics people of different classes could wear.</p> <p>But the peasants\u2019 movement survived; in fact, it thrived. Some landlords cut their rents by more than half between 1350 and 1400. In the same period, wages for agricultural workers rose by around 50% for men and 100% for women. And by the turn of the century, almost all rents in England were paid in cash, rather than feudal services, reflecting how many former serfs had bought their freedom.</p> <p>But over the next five centuries, a minority of freed peasants enclosed common farming land and made it their private property, so that most of the labouring classes were forced into cramped city slums and dangerous jobs. And at the beginning of the 20th century, the anger this engendered was radicalised, first by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/first-world-war-imperial-bloodbath\">failures of Europe\u2019s ruling classes</a> in the first world war, and then by another plague: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">the 1918 outbreak of Spanish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">flu</a>, which killed tens of millions.</p> <p>Across many of the countries affected by the pandemic, militants and reformers demanded change, and governments improvised public health innovations. The eventual result was the first phase of welfare state construction across the world, which climaxed with the Swedish social democrats\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-14-3-c-the-swedish-model-welfare-for-everyone\">ambitious reforms of the 1930s</a>. These provided housing, childcare, child benefits, pensions and other social security. Once again, political organising in response to a pandemic had enabled enormous change.</p> <p>But Spain\u2019s experience during this period shows us there\u2019s no reason why organising or change have to be progressive. When influenza reached the Iberian peninsula (it wasn\u2019t actually \u201cSpanish\u201d flu \u2013 that was a misnomer), the response of the country\u2019s establishment reflected its reactionary goals. In<a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137339201\"> his history of the outbreak there</a>, Ryan Davis shows how politicians, doctors and journalists sought to control the unhygienic masses with a \u201csanitary dictatorship\u201d. In Galicia, police accompanied doctors on house visits, and in Murcia <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=taEhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=youth+juntas+Murcia+spanish+flu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LrTd6WM9O6&amp;sig=ACfU3U1WCAp_Pc1U5ImLY8IchK47NqeYQQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfmaPoj-_oAhUIM8AKHa2LDCEQ6AEwAHoECAsQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=youth%20juntas%20Murcia%20spanish%20flu&amp;f=false\">youth juntas were created</a> to denounce public health infractions.</p> <p>As well as weakening the country\u2019s revolutionary socialist and anarchist movements, this militarisation of Spanish society laid the social foundations of the dictatorships that would rule Spain \u2013 with brief interludes \u2013 until the mid-1970s.</p> <p>In recent weeks, some people have optimistically predicted that the Covid-19 outbreak will force governments to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/the-coronavirus-outbreak-shows-us-that-no-one-can-take-on-this-enemy-alone\">fairer economic systems</a>. But the peasants\u2019 story reminds us that change isn\u2019t automatic, and Spain\u2019s history shows that the bad guys can take advantage of a crisis, too. Look at the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">seizing the right to rule by decree</a> while citing Covid-19 as his excuse.</p> <p>There are great strategic challenges ahead. Lockdown gives workers and renters power \u2013 the government has to pay people not to work, and landlords are struggling to evict tenants or get new ones \u2013 but it will not last. While previous pandemics cut the labour force, this crisis will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-uk-business-activity-plunges-to-lowest-ebb-since-records-began\">increase unemployment</a>, perhaps to levels unknown for centuries, and bosses will exploit workers\u2019 desperation so that they can keep wages low and conditions poor.</p> <p>Conservatives are organising already, subtly shifting responsibility for the severity of the outbreak from government failures on to individual \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11368296/police-force-660-part-covidiots-lockdown-rules-coronavirus/\">covidiots</a>\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/salvini-attacks-italy-pm-over-coronavirus-and-links-to-rescue-ship\">migrants</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/18/not-racist-at-all-donald-trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-the-chinese-virus-video\">other countries</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1250101883747930113?s=20\">gearing up for a return to austerity</a> when the downturn slows.</p> <p>Countries with social democratic governments could strengthen the hand of workers by paying all residents a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">basic income</a>, but there\u2019s no chance of Britain\u2019s Tories doing that. The question for the UK trade union movement is an old one: how to choreograph a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d strategy, with enough radical action to force concessions out of politicians and bosses, and enough conciliatory noises to build a broad coalition of support.</p> <p>The left will need to work through and rebuild all sorts of institutions for collective action. Members of renters unions such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Living_Rent\">Living Rent</a> have negotiated rent cuts and breaks since lockdown began: imagine the power that tenants could wield \u2013 and hold on to after lockdown ends \u2013 if everyone getting grief from their landlord was told how to fight back. (Here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.livingrent.org/covid_19_faqs\">advice for Scotland</a>, and for <a href=\"https://londonrentersunion.org/coronavirus-qa/\">England and Wales</a>.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">Mutual Aid groups</a> have created an exceptionally diverse and capable network of neighbours who are excited about helping their communities. Once the outbreak is over, it\u2019s vital they carry on that organising, for instance, lobbying local businesses to pay a living wage.</p> <p>Like the generations of peasants who took advantage of their landlords\u2019 need for labour, we hold enormous power, but only if we fight together. Even then, change may be inevitable but progress certainly isn\u2019t: look at how, over a decade, Spain\u2019s reactionaries exploited their country\u2019s influenza outbreak. In an age when political decision-making happens at lightspeed on Twitter, Whatsapp and Zoom, we need to act collectively \u2013 and we need to act now.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Power Sayeed is the author of a history of New Labour and Britain in the 1990s, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/1997-Future-that-Never-Happened-ebook/dp/B076M7TMGH\">1997: The Future that Never Happened</a></p> <p><br></p>",

The Peasants\u2019 Revolt of 1381 was the biggest, but it was an overreach and was defeated. The ruling aristocracy resisted the peasants\u2019 demands from the outset. Brutal new laws tried to stop labourers asking for better pay, and even specified what kind of fabrics people of different classes could wear. But the peasants\u2019 movement survived; in fact, it thrived. Some landlords cut their rents by more than half between 1350 and 1400. In the same period, wages for agricultural workers rose by around 50% for men and 100% for women. And by the turn of the century, almost all rents in England were paid in cash, rather than feudal services, reflecting how many former serfs had bought their freedom. But over the next five centuries, a minority of freed peasants enclosed common farming land and made it their private property, so that most of the labouring classes were forced into cramped city slums and dangerous jobs. And at the beginning of the 20th century, the anger this engendered was radicalised, first by the failures of Europe\u2019s ruling classes in the first world war, and then by another plague: the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu, which killed tens of millions. Across many of the countries affected by the pandemic, militants and reformers demanded change, and governments improvised public health innovations. The eventual result was the first phase of welfare state construction across the world, which climaxed with the Swedish social democrats\u2019 ambitious reforms of the 1930s. These provided housing, childcare, child benefits, pensions and other social security. Once again, political organising in response to a pandemic had enabled enormous change. But Spain\u2019s experience during this period shows us there\u2019s no reason why organising or change have to be progressive. When influenza reached the Iberian peninsula (it wasn\u2019t actually \u201cSpanish\u201d flu \u2013 that was a misnomer), the response of the country\u2019s establishment reflected its reactionary goals. In his history of the outbreak there, Ryan Davis shows how politicians, doctors and journalists sought to control the unhygienic masses with a \u201csanitary dictatorship\u201d. In Galicia, police accompanied doctors on house visits, and in Murcia youth juntas were created to denounce public health infractions. As well as weakening the country\u2019s revolutionary socialist and anarchist movements, this militarisation of Spanish society laid the social foundations of the dictatorships that would rule Spain \u2013 with brief interludes \u2013 until the mid-1970s. In recent weeks, some people have optimistically predicted that the Covid-19 outbreak will force governments to build fairer economic systems. But the peasants\u2019 story reminds us that change isn\u2019t automatic, and Spain\u2019s history shows that the bad guys can take advantage of a crisis, too. Look at the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seizing the right to rule by decree while citing Covid-19 as his excuse. There are great strategic challenges ahead. Lockdown gives workers and renters power \u2013 the government has to pay people not to work, and landlords are struggling to evict tenants or get new ones \u2013 but it will not last. While previous pandemics cut the labour force, this crisis will increase unemployment, perhaps to levels unknown for centuries, and bosses will exploit workers\u2019 desperation so that they can keep wages low and conditions poor. Conservatives are organising already, subtly shifting responsibility for the severity of the outbreak from government failures on to individual \u201ccovidiots\u201d, migrants or other countries, and gearing up for a return to austerity when the downturn slows. Countries with social democratic governments could strengthen the hand of workers by paying all residents a basic income, but there\u2019s no chance of Britain\u2019s Tories doing that. The question for the UK trade union movement is an old one: how to choreograph a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d strategy, with enough radical action to force concessions out of politicians and bosses, and enough conciliatory noises to build a broad coalition of support. The left will need to work through and rebuild all sorts of institutions for collective action. Members of renters unions such as Living Rent have negotiated rent cuts and breaks since lockdown began: imagine the power that tenants could wield \u2013 and hold on to after lockdown ends \u2013 if everyone getting grief from their landlord was told how to fight back. (Here\u2019s the advice for Scotland, and for England and Wales.) Mutual Aid groups have created an exceptionally diverse and capable network of neighbours who are excited about helping their communities. Once the outbreak is over, it\u2019s vital they carry on that organising, for instance, lobbying local businesses to pay a living wage. Like the generations of peasants who took advantage of their landlords\u2019 need for labour, we hold enormous power, but only if we fight together. Even then, change may be inevitable but progress certainly isn\u2019t: look at how, over a decade, Spain\u2019s reactionaries exploited their country\u2019s influenza outbreak. In an age when political decision-making happens at lightspeed on Twitter, Whatsapp and Zoom, we need to act collectively \u2013 and we need to act now. \u2022 Richard Power Sayeed is the author of a history of New Labour and Britain in the 1990s, 1997: The Future that Never Happened",

Estok couldn\u2019t do anything for that family, or for anyone else, even though he wants to desperately. \u201cTo know that I\u2019m healthy, to know that I\u2019m a candidate \u2013 like a solid candidate \u2013 for donation, but I can\u2019t because \u2026 I don\u2019t know, they can\u2019t get an IT guy in to fix their computers?\u201d Estok said. \u201cThat\u2019s so hard for me to wrap my head around.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Jessica Glenza, health reporter</h2> <p>When I pictured covering a crisis as a reporter, and I assumed one day I would, I did not imagine it would be from my kitchen table. But here I am. Stuck in a chilly apartment in Jersey City as we all, reporters included, attempt physical distancing.</p> <p>When Covid-19 first struck New York, I would walk to a park near my apartment with a panoramic view of the city, look across the Hudson River, and remember people who were once part of my daily routine: the deli workers, the delivery men, the nurses and doctors.</p> <p>And one day I woke up to hear Covid-19 had reached its grim hand across the water and taken hold of my own community. My city councilman, Michael Yun, died \u2013 his storefront served constituents just a few city blocks from my home.</p> <p>Flowers, picture frames and memorial messages were stuck in the roll-down steel gate. His smile was still alive on the awning above the store. The shop was his magazine stand for decades before he became a politician.</p> <p>From this kitchen table, I\u2019ve talked to weeping emergency room doctors, angry nurses and stoic medical residents. I\u2019ve interviewed experts in bioethics, palliative care, health insurance and hospital financing.</p> <p>We all knew that America\u2019s patchwork, for-profit health system would be a frail match against a vicious disease such as Covid-19. But constant calls for reform were often chalked up to politics, and change was always delayed.</p> <p>Now, as a slow and bungled response from leaders in Washington DC continues to hamper any effort to recover, decades of poor health policy have been exposed.</p> <p>Picture this: in 1975, the population of the US was 215 million people. Today, it is 328 million. In roughly that time, the US has <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf\">lost 567,000 hospital beds</a>, down from 1.4 million, because they were considered inefficient and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-13/why-u-s-hospitals-are-ill-prepared-for-coronavirus\">unprofitable</a>.</p> <p>This was directly related to how people pay for healthcare. As the number of hospital beds fell, emergency departments also closed because they were the only part of the hospital required to treat patients who couldn\u2019t pay. Which, it turns out, was a lot of people.</p> <p>On average, the cost of healthcare per person between 1960 and 2015 has outpaced wage growth by roughly 2.4% each year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/HistoricalNHEPaper.pdf\">government economists</a>. We\u2019ve also managed to exclude 9% of the entire population, or roughly 28 million people, from health insurance entirely, with catastrophic potential for people\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Is it any wonder, then, that it is unaffordable for Americans to see the doctor? That, last year, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/data-note-americans-challenges-health-care-costs/\">half of Americans</a> delayed or skipped care because of prohibitive costs? That, in turn, those untreated chronic conditions leave people vulnerable to Covid-19? And that the most <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/disparities-in-health-and-health-care-five-key-questions-and-answers/\">vulnerable among us</a>, both to Covid-19 and chronic health conditions, are the poor and people of colour?</p> <p>These questions, of course, are rhetorical. Because even as this pandemic leaves us shocked and terrified, the 10,000 horrific deaths in New York City alone are the predictable consequence of a healthcare system that leaves so many people on the sidelines.</p> <p>There are some other people I have talked to in this crisis: people with hope. Many emergency room doctors, nurses and researchers believe Americans may now see how urgent change is, and believe that maybe in disaster there is also opportunity.</p> <h2>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter</h2> <p>What does a reporter do when they are in lockdown and can\u2019t get out of the house to report? How can you write the first draft of history when you\u2019re not able to witness history in the making?</p> <p>Well, one answer I have discovered, as a Guardian reporter barely able to leave our Brooklyn home (my wife, Jessica, has a brain tumour, so we are being extra careful to avoid infection), is that you join your son for one of his online college classes.</p> <p>One evening, I was drawn into listening to a Zoom panel discussion at Georgetown University, where Felix is in his final year. One of the speakers was Ron Klain, who in 2014 was appointed by Barack Obama to be America\u2019s Ebola tsar. He was asked what he thought of the way Donald Trump was handling coronavirus, and he replied: \u201cThe response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.\u201d</p> <p>It was like a eureka moment for me. Suddenly everything that I had been hearing and reading \u2013 Trump\u2019s downplaying of the crisis, his comparison of Covid-19 to flu, the botched federal effort over diagnostic testing \u2013 fell into place. We were living through a historic failure of leadership and governance.</p> <p>That electric realisation set me on the path towards writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">a series of pieces tracking Trump\u2019s epic mishandling of the pandemic</a> and its cost in American lives. I may not be able to leave the house, but with a little help from my son\u2019s online classes I hope I have found a way to contribute to our understanding \u2013 and anger \u2013 about the disaster that\u2019s unfolding here in the richest nation on Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebce546cbd8b68c0c7ade69d6fdb9bed93b9cf87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebce546cbd8b68c0c7ade69d6fdb9bed93b9cf87/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Park Avenue in Manhattan earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park Avenue in Manhattan earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz Gordon/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amanda Holpuch, reporter</h2> <p>The first time I walked outside in New York City, once people were sheltering in place, I felt an eerie sense of familiarity. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, was begging Donald Trump to send more ventilators to the city while the president was insisting the country would be back open by Easter. The mix of desolate streets, denial from the Trump White House and pleas from a political leader had happened two-and-a-half years earlier in Puerto Rico, after hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island. One big difference was that, in Puerto Rico, I woke up every day trying to get deeper into the island to understand the extent of destruction while phone and internet service were almost completely shut down. Now I\u2019m stuck at home, depending on the phone and internet to let me know what is happening in the city I live in. <br><br>It makes a big difference, seeing people\u2019s faces and interviewing them in person. I\u2019ve been focused on the economic impact of the outbreak, so I do get a small taste of what that looks like when I walk past closed restaurants and shop at a grocery store where the city building inspectors are limiting how many people are inside. I\u2019m really looking forward to interviewing people in person again.<br><br>I\u2019m also deeply concerned that, a few months down the line, we\u2019re going to see the same sort of denial from the White House that has followed Hurricane Maria \u2013 Trump still hasn\u2019t acknowledged the actual death toll from the hurricanes.</p> <h2>Tom McCarthy, national affairs correspondent</h2> <p>I\u2019ve been working exclusively from my kitchen table, so all news collection has happened on the phone, by text or online. The challenge is to tell a national story while operating from this island. But working to our advantage, I\u2019ve found, is a real sense of urgency on the part of sources \u2013 experts in public health and emergency response. They want to get the message out: we need tests, we need contact tracing, we need equipment, we need leadership, and we need a plan. One public health expert whom I met on the phone last month texts me multiple times overnight; I awake to his links. Then home-schooling for my two daughters begins, with its own set of challenges.</p> <p>Ironically, physical distancing has offered windows into the lives of sources across the country that otherwise would never appear. Before, you had a sense of which sources were likely to know what and which analysts could speak most effectively in a public-facing way. Now you know who has a dog and who yells at their kids, and whose kids yell at the dog. It\u2019s been cheering, that part of it.</p> <h2><strong>Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter</strong></h2> <p>I was a freelancer for seven years before starting full time with the Guardian last October, and so have perhaps found working from home a bit easier than others. Still, staying indoors while the world outside unravels and people suffer so terribly goes against my instincts as a journalist and human being. We\u2019ve all had to adapt.</p> <p>It\u2019s been almost three months since the WHO declared a public health emergency, so what have we learnt? It\u2019s undeniable that coronavirus is not an equalizer, far from it, the communities suffering the worst Covid-19 outcomes in the US are low income households, people of colour and Native Americans - who by no coincidence are the folks most likely to live in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/pollution-hotspots-hit-hardest-by-coronavirus-us\">polluted neighbourhoods, </a>without access to clean, running water, adequate nutritious food, and green spaces.</p> <p>These environmental inequalities fuel all sorts of health disparities, and Covid-19 has proven to be no different.</p> <p>What\u2019s also clear from my reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/millions-us-at-risk-losing-running-water-amid-layoffs-triggered-coronavirus-pandemic\">water shutoffs </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">food banks</a>, is that mass layoffs in a country with virtually no safety nets, means millions of Americans will now need emergency food aid and help paying extortionate water bills.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus pandemic today include: Record daily jump of Covid-19 cases in Russia The Covid-19 death toll in Russia has risen to 313, with the country reporting a record daily jump in confirmed infections. The number of coronavirus-related deaths increased by 40 overnight, with authorities reporting 4,785 new cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 36,793. Moscow, which became the centre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak and was also the first region in the country to introduce a lockdown, recorded 2,649 new cases and 21 deaths, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said. Extra PPE to be delivered to Scottish care homes amid supply concerns Extra supplies of personal protective equipment will be delivered directly to more than 1,000 care homes in Scotland, as concerns about the supply and quality of PPE continue. While the care sector usually sources its own PPE, the pandemic has put extreme pressure on supply chains with concerns raised earlier this week that some manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to Scotland. The Scottish government announced overnight that NHS National Services Scotland would prioritise the delivery of stock directly to care homes where the virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local hubs which supply PPE to other care workers. Trump administration accused of dereliction of duty over testing failure Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been accused of a dereliction of duty by a senator over its failure to rapidly expand coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, vented his frustration in a phone call with the vice-president, Mike Pence, on Friday, according to reports. \u201cI have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,\u201d King reportedly said during the conversation. Iran\u2019s coronavirus death toll hits 5,000 Iran\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll has topped 5,000. In the last 24 hours, there have been 73 new coronavirus deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 5,031, the health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour told state TV. The daily death toll was one of the lowest in recent days, he said, adding that the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country had reached 80,868. According to a parliamentary report released earlier this week, the coronavirus death toll might be almost double the figure announced by the health ministry, and the number of infections eight to 10 times higher. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East, with one of the world\u2019s highest coronavirus-related death tolls. Hundreds of Taiwanese navy sailors quarantined About 700 Taiwanese navy sailors are being put in quarantine after three Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a goodwill mission to the Pacific island state of Palau, the country\u2019s government has announced. Three Taiwan navy vessels visited Palau \u2013 an archipelago of islands which was under US administration until its independence in 1994 and is one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan \u2013 in the middle of March and returned to Taiwan a month later, Chen Shih-chung, the health minister, said.",

      "bodyText": "Unapproved antibody tests could increase people\u2019s risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, the UK\u2019s national testing coordinator has warned. Countries around the globe are scrambling to develop reliable antibody tests that can detect if people have had the virus and may be immune, in the hope that this might allow for a loosening of lockdown restrictions \u2013 so far without success. Reports have emerged that organisations and individuals are trying to acquire tests, with many of these testing kits likely to yield false results. John Newton, the national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, believes efforts to develop accurate tests look promising, but said that \u201cmisleading\u201d results of unapproved tests could increase the risk of becoming ill or spreading the virus. \u201cThe government, supported by world-leading experts and regulators, is continuing to work hard to rapidly deliver a reliable and accurate back-to-work antibody testing kit, to counter the spread of the virus and enable people to return to work safely,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe are breaking new ground with this work every day and I am confident this major research effort will make a breakthrough. \u201cIn the meantime, I advise organisations, both in the public and private sector, against the use of antibody tests that have not been verified in a laboratory setting \u2013 and none have. The government has suffered several setbacks in its attempts to procure or develop reliable tests, which are widely believed to be the only chance of a gradual lifting of the national lockdown as long as there is no effective and available vaccine against Covid-19. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced in March that 3.5m antibody tests had been bought, but researchers found that none of the tests meet the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) standards, forcing the government to row back on claims the tests would be ready for a public rollout this month. Newton said once reliable tests had been found, they would be used across the country \u201cas a back-to-work test\u201d. Senior epidemiologists from the World Health Organization have said there is no proof people who have recovered from coronavirus have immunity and cannot be infected again. \u201cThere are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity,\u201d WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, told a press conference in Geneva. \u201cRight now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection. \u201cThese antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence \u2013 that level of antibodies \u2013 but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies is immune.\u201d Van Kerkhove described the mass development of tests as \u201ca good thing\u201d, but urged caution. \u201cWe need to ensure that they are validated so that we know they are actually measuring what they say they attempt to measure.\u201d Her colleague Michael Ryan said the antibody tests were a necessary element in any coherent public health strategy, but added: \u201cThere are serious ethical issues around the use of such an approach and we need to address it very carefully, we also need to look at the length of protection that antibodies might give. \u201cYou might have someone who believes they are seropositive (have been infected) and protected in a situation where they may be exposed and in fact they are susceptible to the disease.\u201d",

It is traditional for royal gun salutes to be fired from different locations in London and across the UK on the monarch\u2019s birthday. Events have been cancelled this year, in line with the Queen\u2019s wishes. \u201cHer Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances,\u201d a Buckingham Palace source said. She will spend the day privately, at Windsor Castle, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, are being shielded. Family members are expected to video call her on the day. In London, salutes are traditionally fired from the Tower of London and Hyde Park on the Queen\u2019s birthday. The basic salute is 21 rounds, fired at 10-second intervals. In Hyde Park, a royal park, there are an extra 20 rounds, making it a 41-gun salute. It is usually fired at midday by the King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery from six 13-pounder guns, which are pulled at speed by teams of horses over the grass. The guns are quickly detached to fire booming blanks which send a puff of white smoke into the air. The salute at the Tower of London is usually fired from four 25-pounder guns located on Tower Wharf facing the River Thames, by the Honourable Artillery Company, at 1pm. This year there is also no obligation for government buildings and town halls to fly the union flag at full mast, as is also traditional on the Queen\u2019s birthday. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has written to state buildings giving the standard advice on flag-flying protocol. This year it has included the instructions: \u201cIn the current circumstances we are not expecting everyone to be able to follow this advice and you should continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines as set out by the government.\u201d It has already been announced there will be no trooping the colour ceremony to mark the Queen\u2019s birthday, officially marked in June. There are currently no plans for any alternative marking of her official birthday.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group \u2013 which owns brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge \u2013 could permanently close some of its shops as the coronavirus pandemic takes a toll on high street retailers. The fashion group has served notice on its landlords that it will leave stores where the leases have rolling breaks or are due to expire. The Guardian understands that the move does not necessarily mean shops will close permanently but that the retailer can enter into negotiations with landlords on how to keep them open. In March, the company asked landlords for rent cuts and paused payments into its pension scheme. The potential closures are not believed to be centred on any particular brands and the number of stores that could be affected has not been confirmed. All of the group\u2019s 550 stores across the UK are closed as the coronavirus lockdown measures, which could last until June, prevent Britons from shopping for anything other than food and essential needs. Like other retailers, Arcadia is facing financial turmoil and earlier this month said 14,500 of its 16,000 employees would be furloughed and apply to the government\u2019s emergency wage scheme. But the retail group had been hit by financial troubles before the Covid-19 crisis. Its high street brands reported pre-tax losses of \u00a3505.1m for the year to September 2018, according to accounts published on Companies House. A series of company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) were proposed in May last year as part of a wider three-year recovery plan, which led to the closures of 23 stores and rent slashes on many others. Under the rescue deal, the group\u2019s US operations went into administration and an additional 25 Evans and Miss Selfridge stores were closed. On Friday, the department store retailer Debenhams confirmed the closure of seven shops with the loss of more than 422 jobs after going into administration last week. Meanwhile, the struggling fashion chains Oasis and Warehouse collapsed into administration, putting 2,300 jobs at risk. Arcadia declined to comment.",

Actually there is one, even more terrifying aspect of Trump\u2019s briefings, which is that, with his uncanny ability to play on the fears and prejudices of his base, nothing he has done will undermine his popularity. Why would it? The joke at election time was this guy\u2019s going to get us all killed, and now a version of that prediction is actually coming to pass, still one imagines his blame-shifting to the Chinese, or the World Health Organization, or Europe, or the Democrats, will be accepted by the same people who shrugged off all his other lunatic assessments. Joe Biden, a daffy centrist with what appeared, during the primary debates, to be a nasty temper, poses a serious threat to Trump to the extent that he can\u2019t reduce him to a single minority category. In his way, Biden, with his lounge-singer swagger and air of total self-confidence, is as Teflon-coated as Trump. He doesn\u2019t sweat the details, is peevish when challenged and has been known to talk absolute garbage \u2013 all expressions, to a greater or lesser degree, of the licence give to certain white men in politics. At this stage, the stakes are so high that all of this has to be swallowed or parked for better times. All that matters is getting Trump off the podium. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

There are even BE KIND <a href=\"https://www.ellenshop.com/collections/ellen-degeneres-be-kind-collection\">face masks</a> \u2013 so you can try killing the coronavirus with kindness.</p> <p>Shockingly, it seems that DeGeneres might not always practice what she preaches: crew members on her talkshow are <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/ellen-crew-furious-over-poor-communication-regarding-pay-non-union-workers-during-coronavirus-shutdown-exclusive-1234582735/\">reportedly furious</a> over the not-so-kind way they\u2019ve been treated during the coronavirus crisis. According to Variety, the core stage crew for the Ellen DeGeneres Show are frustrated that they haven\u2019t received written communication about the status of their hours or pay. They were also less than thrilled to discover, via social media, that an outside, non-union, tech company had been hired to help DeGeneres film her show remotely from her home. This stung as DeGeneres had recently announced on-air that she wanted to start filming again as soon as possible so she could support her staff and crew.</p> <p>DeGeneres isn\u2019t personally responsible for every aspect of how her show is run, of course. But it certainly seems like a woman who is reportedly worth more than $330m and is one of the highest-paid stars on television, earning more than $50m a year, could be doing rather more to support the people who work under her. Particularly as many of her crew have worked on the show since it started 17 years ago. It\u2019s worth noting that Jimmy Kimmel Live! stagehands, according to Variety, were paid from Kimmel\u2019s own pocket during initial coronavirus shutdowns.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t exactly the first time that DeGeneres\u2019s public persona has appeared to be at odds with her private actions. There have been rumors floating around for years that the 62-year-old comedian is \u2013 to quote a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminJS/status/1241053251916587009?s=20\">viral </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminJS/status/1241053251916587009?s=20\">Twitter thread</a> on the subject \u2013 \u201cone of the meanest people alive\u201d. Recently, however, anti-Ellen sentiment appears to have reached new heights. A couple of weeks ago she was slammed for comparing self-quarantining in her multimillion-dollar mansion to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-quarantine-jail-trnd/index.html\">being in jail</a>\u201d, for example. And Nikkie de Jager, a Dutch YouTube star who goes by the name NikkieTutorials, has been in the headlines this week after sharing her <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/tatianatenreyrowhitlock/nikkietutorials-shares-ellen-mistreatment-details\">unpleasant experience on the Ellen show</a>. De Jager told Dutch magazine &amp;C that she wasn\u2019t allowed to use the toilet nearest her on the show because it \u201cwas reserved for the Jonas brothers\u201d and that DeGeneres was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/nikkietutorials-spoken-again-about-how-she-was-treated-ellen-degeneres-2020-4\">cold and distant\u201d</a> when the cameras weren\u2019t rolling. \u201cI was expecting [the experience to be like] a Disney show, but got Teletubbies after dark.\u201d</p> <p>Why is DeGeneres suddenly getting so much backlash and bad press? Well, for one thing, coronavirus has made us all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/the-coronavirus-crisis-has-exposed-the-ugly-truth-about-celebrity-culture-and-capitalism\">sick to death of celebrity shenanigans</a>. It\u2019s hard for stars to seem relatable when they\u2019re moaning about their mansions.</p> <p>More broadly, however, I think some of the animosity towards DeGeneres has to do with the way she exemplifies the hypocrisy around the concept of \u201ccivility\u201d. Last year, for example, DeGeneres lectured us all on her friendship with George W Bush, a man who opposed same-sex marriage and whose own former counter-terrorism chief <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/richard-clarke-george-bush-war-crimes_n_5410619\">accused him of committing war crimes</a>. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another\u2019, I don\u2019t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,\u201d DeGeneres said on her show, in response to criticism of her hobnobbing with Bush. \u201cI mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, it\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that. The notion of civility has been weaponized to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/12/nancy-pelosis-renewed-attacks-on-aoc-arent-just-disrespectful-theyre-dangerous\">shut down criticism</a> and stop people from pointing out uncomfortable facts. It seems to be considered more unacceptable, in some parts of the media, to call someone a racist than to actually be a racist. It seems to be considered more unacceptable to criticize someone for hanging out with a war criminal than actually being a war criminal. \u201cBe kind!\u201d the 1% keep telling us, \u201cdon\u2019t you dare be critical!\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to completely slam DeGeneres. She\u2019s done a lot of good in the world. It\u2019s hard to overstate how brave it was for her to come out in 1997; her courage made life a lot easier for the next generation of queer people. According to a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/ellen-degeneres-gay-rights-gay-marriage-1201531462/\">2015 poll</a>, Ellen did more to influence Americans\u2019 attitudes about gay rights than any other celebrity or public figure. But if she wants to keep flogging merchandise with BE KIND on it, then she might want to start thinking a little harder about what those words actually mean. And I say that in the kindest possible way.</p> <h2>Domestic abuse killings more than double during coronavirus lockdown</h2> <p>Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a project that records the killing of women by men, has identified at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">16 suspected domestic abuse killings</a> in the UK since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed.

Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2020/04/17/on-call-with-pence-king-calls-coronavirus-testing-effort-a-dereliction-of-duty/#\">reportedly</a> vented his frustration to the vice-president, Mike Pence.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,\u201d King reportedly said during the conversation. The White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/white-house-testing-criticism-coronavirus-reopen-economy\">has pushed back at widespread criticism</a> that the US lacks the testing capacity to end lockdowns and reopen its economy.</p> \n<p>King\u2019s comments came hours after Trump posted incendiary tweets that potentially stoked protests against physical distancing and stay-at-home measures in three states led by Democratic governors.</p> \n<p>In Spain, the second-worst affected country by number of infections, but with fewer deaths than Italy, the death toll passed 20,000 on Saturday, after 565 new fatalities were recorded in 24 hours. The rate of increase slowed slightly, bolstering hope the country may be bringing its outbreak under control.</p> \n<p>On China\u2019s borders, North Korean authorities have confirmed for the first time that they have seen cases of the disease, Radio Free Asia reported. The infections were revealed in public lectures, but no numbers were given.</p> \n<p>Pyongyang tried to seal itself off entirely in the early days of the pandemic, closing its borders and flying dozens of foreign diplomats out of the country in March. The country is one of many where weak public health infrastructure has led to fears that an outbreak of the coronavirus could prove devastating.</p> \n<p>Afghanistan is another, because of a fragile health network and minimal social welfare provisions. Many people say they have to work or they will starve, and although physical distancing has been ordered, it is often observed only loosely. There have been 33 deaths so far.</p> \n<p>The country\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, has cut back almost all contact with staff, working digitally and meeting only a close inner circle in person, after officials who work at the presidential palace tested positive for the disease.</p> \n<p>The virus is thought to have arrived via a contaminated document delivered from another department, a senior health official told Reuters.</p> \n<p>Ghani, 70, has had serious gastrointestinal health problems in the past, making him potentially more vulnerable to the coronavirus if he catches it.</p> \n<p>The pandemic comes at a particularly difficult time for the country, with Ghani still locked in a dispute over the results of last year\u2019s presidential election, trying to start peace talks with the Taliban after Washington agreed a withdrawal deal, and grappling with fallout from a major reduction in US aid.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are also concerns about the impact of coronavirus across Africa. The continent has so far suffered less than other regions, recording nearly 17,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Limited testing in many countries, however, may have deprived officials of a full picture of the disease\u2019s spread.</p> \n<p>The IMF and World Bank have appealed for rapid international action to help African countries respond to the pandemic that will cause the continent\u2019s economy to shrink by 1.25% in 2020, the worst reading on record.</p> \n<p>Kyari, who acted as a gatekeeper to Buhari, is among the most high-profile victims in the region. Nigeria has recorded 493 confirmed cases and 17 deaths so far, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.</p> \n<p>Other developments around the world include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The US president said protesters who flouted physical distancing measures \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d, when commenting on demonstrations against stay-at-home orders.

In the US, Donald Trump\u2019s administration was accused of a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d over the slow expansion of coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, reportedly vented his frustration to the vice-president, Mike Pence. \u201cI have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,\u201d King reportedly said during the conversation. The White House has pushed back at widespread criticism that the US lacks the testing capacity to end lockdowns and reopen its economy. King\u2019s comments came hours after Trump posted incendiary tweets that potentially stoked protests against physical distancing and stay-at-home measures in three states led by Democratic governors. In Spain, the second-worst affected country by number of infections, but with fewer deaths than Italy, the death toll passed 20,000 on Saturday, after 565 new fatalities were recorded in 24 hours. The rate of increase slowed slightly, bolstering hope the country may be bringing its outbreak under control. On China\u2019s borders, North Korean authorities have confirmed for the first time that they have seen cases of the disease, Radio Free Asia reported. The infections were revealed in public lectures, but no numbers were given. Pyongyang tried to seal itself off entirely in the early days of the pandemic, closing its borders and flying dozens of foreign diplomats out of the country in March. The country is one of many where weak public health infrastructure has led to fears that an outbreak of the coronavirus could prove devastating. Afghanistan is another, because of a fragile health network and minimal social welfare provisions. Many people say they have to work or they will starve, and although physical distancing has been ordered, it is often observed only loosely. There have been 33 deaths so far. The country\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, has cut back almost all contact with staff, working digitally and meeting only a close inner circle in person, after officials who work at the presidential palace tested positive for the disease. The virus is thought to have arrived via a contaminated document delivered from another department, a senior health official told Reuters. Ghani, 70, has had serious gastrointestinal health problems in the past, making him potentially more vulnerable to the coronavirus if he catches it. The pandemic comes at a particularly difficult time for the country, with Ghani still locked in a dispute over the results of last year\u2019s presidential election, trying to start peace talks with the Taliban after Washington agreed a withdrawal deal, and grappling with fallout from a major reduction in US aid. There are also concerns about the impact of coronavirus across Africa. The continent has so far suffered less than other regions, recording nearly 17,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Limited testing in many countries, however, may have deprived officials of a full picture of the disease\u2019s spread. The IMF and World Bank have appealed for rapid international action to help African countries respond to the pandemic that will cause the continent\u2019s economy to shrink by 1.25% in 2020, the worst reading on record. Kyari, who acted as a gatekeeper to Buhari, is among the most high-profile victims in the region. Nigeria has recorded 493 confirmed cases and 17 deaths so far, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Other developments around the world include: The US president said protesters who flouted physical distancing measures \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d, when commenting on demonstrations against stay-at-home orders. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and confederate flags, and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. Trump again cast doubt on China\u2019s death toll, which was revised up on Friday, and said \u201ca lot of strange things are happening\u201d regarding the origins of the coronavirus. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 3,609 to 137,439, data from the Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases showed on Saturday, marking a fourth straight day of a rise in infections. Australia\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 rose to 68 on Saturday, with 6,533 infections. Twelve Guatemalan migrants on deportation flight from the US tested positive for Covid-19. The Kurdish-led administration in north-east Syria said the World Health Organization had found the area\u2019s first case of coronavirus earlier this month after samples were tested in Damascus. All airline passengers in Canada will be required to wear non-medical masks or face coverings during travel to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mexico\u2019s president said Trump had promised Mexico would be able to buy 1,000 ventilators and other intensive-therapy equipment used in treating severe cases of Covid-19. China reported that 27 new coronavirus cases were confirmed on Friday, of which 17 were linked to foreign travel. No new fatalities were recorded.",

He said a \u201cgeneral road map\u201d spelling out the lockdown measures, but without a timetable of how they would progress, would be \u201cwell received\u201d by the nation. \u201cWhat we need is strategic clarity as to what happens next, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling for,\u201d he said. \u201cMy concern has been that there has been a clarion call for an exit strategy when the government must make clear there is no exit from this until a vaccine is procured and delivered to a sizeable proportion of the population, therefore the longevity of this needs to be managed.\u201d \u201cLetting the nation know what is coming round the corner helps keep minds focused and people on board,\u201d he added. Ellwood admitted that the prime minister\u2019s absence had been a \u201creal setback\u201d in communication with the public, describing Boris Johnson as \u201cthe best communicator in government\u201d. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also blamed the government\u2019s lack of information on the end of lockdown on Johnson\u2019s absence, a claim which the spokesperson for the prime minister said was \u201cjust wrong\u201d. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has already set out five clear tests to consider before making any adjustment to its approach. \u201cAt all times we have been consistently guided by scientific advice to protect lives. The current advice from Sage is that relaxing any of the measures could risk damage to public health, our economy, and the sacrifices we have all made. \u201cOnly when the evidence suggests that it is safe to do, and the scientific advice provides for it, will we adjust these measures.\u201d",

The arrests took place just hours after China\u2019s top representative office in the semi-autonomous city declared it is not bound by Hong Kong\u2019s constitutional restrictions that bar Chinese government from interfering in local affairs. Police arrested prominent figures, including the media tycoon Jimmy Lai and 81-year-old Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic party and a senior barrister, in the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the sometimes violent anti-government protests that have rocked the former British colony since June last year. The 15 people arrested allegedly organised and took part in unlawful assemblies and police do not rule out that more will be arrested, Supt Lam Wing-Ho said. Also among the detained were the barrister Margaret Ng, lawyer Albert Ho, labour rights activist Lee Cheuk-yan, former legislators Leung Kwok-hung and Au Nok-hin, and younger activists such as Figo Chan, the vice-convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised several mass protests approved by police last year. The 15 were accused of joining three unapproved protests on 18 August, 1 October and 20 October last year, local media reported. Pro-democracy lawmakers say the arrests are an attempt to silence the movement after Chinese officials told Hong Kong to enact national security legislation.

Hong Kong was promised a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d for at least 50 years after China resumed control in 1997, under the Sino-British joint declaration. The city\u2019s post-handover mini-constitution, the Basic Law, bars the mainland Chinese government from interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local governments \u201cmay interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong special administrative region administers on its own in accordance with this law.\u201d But the liaison office statement, published late on Friday, asserts that \u201ca high degree of autonomy is not complete autonomy.\u201d It stresses that Hong Kong\u2019s right to self-rule is \u201cauthorised by the central government.\u201d The statement argues that the liaison office and the HKMAO \u201care not what is referred to in article 22 of the Basic Law, or what is commonly understood to be \u2018departments under the central people\u2019s government\u2019.\u201d It adds that the offices derive their authority both from China\u2019s constitution and the Basic Law. This week, pro-democracy lawmakers accused the Chinese government of \u201cblatant intervention\u201d and violation of article 22 of the Basic Law after the HKMAO said some lawmakers were guilty of misconduct in public office for delaying bills, failing to appoint a House committee chairman and paralysing the legislature by filibustering. The liaison office statement said people who made such allegations were distorting the Basic Law and misleading public opinion, adding that \u201cloyalty to the country is a necessary requirement\u201d for lawmakers. China law expert Prof Jerome Cohen at the New York University descibed China\u2019s statement is \u201castounding and incendiary\u201d. \u201cIf taken seriously, it collapses the whole one country, two systems edifice that was constructed over so many years since the joint declaration,\u201d he said. Prof Michael Davis, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said China\u2019s aggressive language would \u201cresult in further pushback\u201d from Hong Kong society, which has already experienced its most severe political crisis. \u201cThe danger is that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be squandered and this has implications for all countries that have relied on the promises made to Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis fear that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy will be lost, along with it the rule of law, is what has driven the many protests in Hong Kong and international concern.\u201d Alvin Cheung, a legal scholar specialising in Hong Kong issues at New York University, said: \u201c[The fact that] Beijing is not even pretending to keep up appearances heralds a dark new stage in Hong Kong\u2019s post-1997 development \u2026 It suggests repression will intensify further.\u201d A Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office spokesperson said in a statement that the UK government was concerned about the arrests and stressed that the right to peaceful protest was \u201cprotected in both the joint declaration and the Basic Law\u201d. \u201cIt is essential that any protests are conducted peacefully, and that the authorities avoid actions that inflame tensions. The authorities should focus on rebuilding trust through a process of meaningful political dialogue,\u201d the statement said. Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, said while the world\u2019s attention is focused on the covid-19 epidemic, Beijing has taken \u201cyet another step towards burying one-country, two-system\u201d and the arrests show that \u201cBeijing is determined to throttle Hong Kong\u201d. He said the liaison office\u2019s claim that it is not bound by the basic law is \u201ca reckless argument which shows that Xi Jinping is determined to abandon the policies pursued by his predecessors, even at the cost of destroying Hong Kong\u2019s way of life\u201d. \u201cIt should be rejected immediately by all those governments and parliaments around the world who know the importance of safe-guarding the high degree of autonomy which is guaranteed by the Basic Law.\u201d Lee, often dubbed the \u201cFather of Democracy\u201d in Hong Kong and a drafter of the Basic Law, said after he was released on bail that he had \u201cno regrets\u201d and felt \u201cproud to walk the road of democracy with the outstanding youths in Hong Kong\u201d.",

The housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, was asked about the effect of coronavirus on people from BAME communities at Saturday\u2019s press briefing. \u201cThere does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus on those from BAME communities,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that reason, the chief medical officer commissioned work from Public Health England to better understand this issue.\u201d Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said: \u201cThis is something that I am very concerned about, and I know that the chief medical officer is concerned about too. \u201cIn NHS England, obviously, a number of our staff \u2026 come from those ethnic groups, and we are actively also looking ahead of that work, of what we have to do to support, and, perhaps, protect them specifically.\u201d Nagpaul said the review was welcome, but that the government could immediately instruct all hospitals to record the ethnicity of patients. \u201cWe desperately need to change the methods of collection [of patient information] and what we collect to understand what is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is endangering lives \u2026 this cannot be brushed under the carpet; it would be morally wrong.\u201d One senior NHS England source admitted to the Observer that the true figure of BAME NHS staff dying from the virus could be higher, given the limited data currently available. The organisation said it was \u201con the back foot\u201d trying to confirm staff deaths first reported on social media. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, called for transparency. \u201cIt is vitally important that government ministers should insist this data is collected and published as a matter of urgency, so we can get the full picture on how the virus impacts all communities,\u201d he said. On Sunday, Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, is expected to draw attention to the \u201cstructural racism in our society\u201d that is causing BAME communities to be hit so hard by the virus. He will pay tribute to ethnic minorities vastly over-represented in frontline roles \u2013 such as care assistants, supermarket workers and bus drivers \u2013 and who are therefore exposed to a much greater risk of catching coronavirus in the first place. According to Sir Michael Marmot, the chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, the stark disparity in the ethnic makeup of deaths from Covid-19 is foreshadowed by wider inequality. \u201cWe know from research that being in poverty reduces your life expectancy and is highly correlated to poorer health outcomes,\u201d he told the Observer. In February, a follow-up to Marmot\u2019s landmark 2010 review concluded that public health inequalities had worsened in the past decade. He added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t collect data, you don\u2019t know a problem exists. In the UK, BAME groups are much more likely to be among lower socioeconomic groups, live in poorer conditions and overcrowded housing and more likely to be in lower-paid and insecure jobs. That means poorer health. \u201cIt also means social distancing is much harder, particularly for older people. Some of the most vulnerable people in our community are living in extended, multi-generational homes.\u201d PHE medical director Yvonne Doyle said: \u201cThis is a really important issue, and detailed and careful work needs to be done before we draw any conclusions.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Johan Lundgren, chief executive, easyJet</h2> <p>For Lundgren, memories of one particular meeting underline just how swiftly coronavirus turned from a distant Chinese problem into an insurmountable block on aviation.</p> <p>It was 3 March and Lundgren was in Brussels for a summit of A4E \u2013 an airline association that includes carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, BA, Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM. The main subjects for discussion were airspace management and green targets. With coronavirus restrictions at that point limited to northern Italy, Ryanair said plummeting demand would be a short-term blip.</p> <p>Lundgren says: \u201cI remember some companies were saying it wouldn\u2019t have a big impact. And I said, \u2018We don\u2019t know anything about this. It\u2019s very uncertain \u2013 you can never tell.\u2019 I wish I had been wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Four weeks later, easyJet\u2019s entire 337-strong fleet was grounded.</p> <p>\u201cFirst and foremost it was a public health issue, so the focus was on the wellbeing of our people and customers. It\u2019s one of those things: when the virus first hits you and you get the first reported case, it becomes very, very real.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, easyJet had only one reported coronavirus case among operating crew, and the airline does not know if they contracted the disease on board.</p> <p>The majority of easyJet employees around Europe have been put on furlough \u2013 just over half of them in the UK scheme. \u201cWe had around 14,000 staff, and now there are about 650 people working, almost all from home.\u201d</p> <p>He holds daily remote conferences with his team and tries to communicate with the whole company via Facebook\u2019s Workplace platform. He says those employees who have not been furloughed staff have never worked harder: \u201cPeople are flat out \u2026 It\u2019s the biggest crisis aviation has ever gone through.\u201d</p> <p>For Lundgren, the main focus is financial \u2013 \u201cgetting access to liquidity, and to reduce the cash burn so we can survive and manage a prolonged scenario\u201d. That has included renegotiating a \u00a34.5bn contract with Airbus for new aircraft \u2013 a deal that has been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/easyjet-agrees-delay-with-airbus-on-delivery-of-24-new-aircraft\" title=\"\">broadsides from easyJet\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou</a>, who last week called for Lundgren to be sacked.</p> <p>The easyJet chief says keeping in touch with staff is vital: \u201cClearly there are a lot of people out there sitting at home, without work, concerned, who want to get back flying. You want to be sure that as we go through this crisis, you don\u2019t leave them out. But it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re not getting everything right.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/10/airlines-law-refunds-voucher-schemes-coronavirus\" title=\"\">EasyJet has been criticised for not automatically offering refunds</a>, and for being slow to cancel flights when restrictions meant passengers were unlikely to travel. Lundgren says the company has been doing its best: \u201cYou make sure you look after, as much as you can, your customers during this process \u2013 and that\u2019s difficult. We\u2019ve got customer call centres in countries affected by the lockdown, that have been operating with limited access when the demand has been very high.\u201d</p> <p>The airline is maintaining \u2013 rather than mothballing \u2013 its fleet, so the planes can be ready to fly again at 15 days\u2019 notice, and Lundgren says the airline is in daily communication with EASA, the European safety regulator, about measures that could be needed for flights to restart \u2013 from disinfecting planes to blocking off middle seats.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to do it in a way that\u2019s safe, orderly and matches the demand that\u2019s out there. But at the same time, no one knows what will happen.\u201d<br><strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></p> <h2>Philip Jansen, chief executive, BT</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d/0_418_6916_4149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coronavirus outbreak hit home for Jansen when he became the first FTSE-100 boss to be <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">publicly confirmed </a><a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">as infected with the virus, in mid-March.</a></p> <p>At that time, BT had already started changing the way it worked in some territories. \u201cWe had started in China, Hong Kong, Italy and Spain at the end of February and early March, as social distancing and lockdowns were implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cThen it became clear that the virus was in the UK. We were a little bit ahead because of our experience in other countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe week I began to have symptoms, the advice was to come to work but keep your distance. I turned up to meetings with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and new Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes \u2013 and deliberately didn\u2019t shake their hands.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the second week of March, when Jansen tested positive and self-isolated with his family at their second home in Devon, the UK had recorded only 11 deaths and almost 800 cases.</p> <p>\u201cI had mild symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always up early, always working. My most important priorities were to keep customers connected and keep our staff safe.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to lead the company and his first job was to film a six-minute video for the 120,000 employees of BT, which includes mobile operator EE as well as Openreach, which runs the UK\u2019s broadband network.</p> <p>When the lockdown started, BT immediately saw a doubling of broadband usage as the country became housebound. Staff absence, due to self-isolation or sickness, is a particular problem. At times up to 20% of staff have been off work, and the company is currently down about 12%, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 25,000 call-centre people, and we handle all the 999 calls \u2013 which have seen a massive spike. We have 30,000 engineers out there working on the broadband and phone network. They are all key workers, and at one stage we were 4,500 down.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most serious issues Jansen and other telecoms companies are dealing with is the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\" title=\"\">wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of the virus.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe have had 45 incidents, ranging from burning masts \u2013 about 18 \u2013 to barbed wire being put around fixed poles where people saw a shiny box and thought it was 5G kit when it wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had people driving their cars at our Openreach engineers then swerving at the last minute to intimidate them, as well as verbal and physical abuse.\u201d</p> <p>He is scathing about the conspiracy theorists: \u201c It is more dangerous lying in the sunshine than walking past a 5G mast. It is unfounded nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Jansen recognises that BT is not under the immense pressure that many businesses have found themselves under during lockdown. However, he says, its pay-TV operation is being hurt by there being no sport on air, and it will also be hit if many of the small businesses it provides telecoms services to do not survive.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is everyone needs what we do,\u201d he says. People need connectivity more than ever before. But we are not immune. The two big areas are BT Sport and the impact on small and medium-sized businesses, restaurants and leisure centres and the like. We can see businesses in deep trouble, and if they fold, that will impact us. But we will weather the storm.\u201d <br><strong>Mark Sweney</strong></p> <h2>James Morris, managing director, Trafalgar Marquees</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c30df73e5bee3a5657467cccaaaf7d21bdcf6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c30df73e5bee3a5657467cccaaaf7d21bdcf6e/0_339_4449_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Morris, MD of Trafalgar Marquees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Morris first realised coronavirus could be a problem in late February, when a German company cancelled its marquee booking for a corporate event in London in June. \u201cAt that point,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwe slightly shrugged it off, and said it was a bit extreme to cancel for June.\u201d But it was only the beginning.</p> <p>Morris would usually be gearing up for the busiest time of year for his events company, which he founded in 2007 using his student overdraft. He had, he says, the \u201cstrongest order book ever\u201d for his marquees, furniture and lighting.</p> <p>The company had been preparing to take on temporary staff and hire vans in April to take equipment to about six events per week, ranging from corporate meetings and outdoor opera to a food festival. Instead, he has lost \u00a3100,000 in cancelled and postponed bookings and has hurriedly tried to cut costs. \u201cOur income has just fallen off a cliff. We are doing some work for the NHS, but it doesn\u2019t really touch the sides.\u201d</p> <p>Morris\u2019s request for an overdraft extension from his bank \u2013 NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was refused. He has subsequently tried to apply for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/covid-19-bailout-loans-issued-uk-firms-banks\" title=\"\">government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils)</a>, but the bank has told him his business is not eligible as it is \u201cnot viable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have invested heavily back in the business, so we have made a loss, but that\u2019s due to our investment. All our assets are fully owned, they are not financed,\u201d says Morris.

      "bodyText": "Johan Lundgren, chief executive, easyJet For Lundgren, memories of one particular meeting underline just how swiftly coronavirus turned from a distant Chinese problem into an insurmountable block on aviation. It was 3 March and Lundgren was in Brussels for a summit of A4E \u2013 an airline association that includes carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, BA, Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM. The main subjects for discussion were airspace management and green targets. With coronavirus restrictions at that point limited to northern Italy, Ryanair said plummeting demand would be a short-term blip. Lundgren says: \u201cI remember some companies were saying it wouldn\u2019t have a big impact. And I said, \u2018We don\u2019t know anything about this. It\u2019s very uncertain \u2013 you can never tell.\u2019 I wish I had been wrong.\u201d Four weeks later, easyJet\u2019s entire 337-strong fleet was grounded. \u201cFirst and foremost it was a public health issue, so the focus was on the wellbeing of our people and customers. It\u2019s one of those things: when the virus first hits you and you get the first reported case, it becomes very, very real.\u201d At this point, easyJet had only one reported coronavirus case among operating crew, and the airline does not know if they contracted the disease on board. The majority of easyJet employees around Europe have been put on furlough \u2013 just over half of them in the UK scheme. \u201cWe had around 14,000 staff, and now there are about 650 people working, almost all from home.\u201d He holds daily remote conferences with his team and tries to communicate with the whole company via Facebook\u2019s Workplace platform. He says those employees who have not been furloughed staff have never worked harder: \u201cPeople are flat out \u2026 It\u2019s the biggest crisis aviation has ever gone through.\u201d For Lundgren, the main focus is financial \u2013 \u201cgetting access to liquidity, and to reduce the cash burn so we can survive and manage a prolonged scenario\u201d. That has included renegotiating a \u00a34.5bn contract with Airbus for new aircraft \u2013 a deal that has been the subject of broadsides from easyJet\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who last week called for Lundgren to be sacked. The easyJet chief says keeping in touch with staff is vital: \u201cClearly there are a lot of people out there sitting at home, without work, concerned, who want to get back flying. You want to be sure that as we go through this crisis, you don\u2019t leave them out. But it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re not getting everything right.\u201d EasyJet has been criticised for not automatically offering refunds, and for being slow to cancel flights when restrictions meant passengers were unlikely to travel. Lundgren says the company has been doing its best: \u201cYou make sure you look after, as much as you can, your customers during this process \u2013 and that\u2019s difficult. We\u2019ve got customer call centres in countries affected by the lockdown, that have been operating with limited access when the demand has been very high.\u201d The airline is maintaining \u2013 rather than mothballing \u2013 its fleet, so the planes can be ready to fly again at 15 days\u2019 notice, and Lundgren says the airline is in daily communication with EASA, the European safety regulator, about measures that could be needed for flights to restart \u2013 from disinfecting planes to blocking off middle seats. \u201cWe need to do it in a way that\u2019s safe, orderly and matches the demand that\u2019s out there. But at the same time, no one knows what will happen.\u201d Gwyn Topham Philip Jansen, chief executive, BT The coronavirus outbreak hit home for Jansen when he became the first FTSE-100 boss to be publicly confirmed as infected with the virus, in mid-March. At that time, BT had already started changing the way it worked in some territories. \u201cWe had started in China, Hong Kong, Italy and Spain at the end of February and early March, as social distancing and lockdowns were implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cThen it became clear that the virus was in the UK. We were a little bit ahead because of our experience in other countries. \u201cThe week I began to have symptoms, the advice was to come to work but keep your distance. I turned up to meetings with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and new Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes \u2013 and deliberately didn\u2019t shake their hands.\u201d At the end of the second week of March, when Jansen tested positive and self-isolated with his family at their second home in Devon, the UK had recorded only 11 deaths and almost 800 cases. \u201cI had mild symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always up early, always working. My most important priorities were to keep customers connected and keep our staff safe.\u201d He continued to lead the company and his first job was to film a six-minute video for the 120,000 employees of BT, which includes mobile operator EE as well as Openreach, which runs the UK\u2019s broadband network. When the lockdown started, BT immediately saw a doubling of broadband usage as the country became housebound. Staff absence, due to self-isolation or sickness, is a particular problem. At times up to 20% of staff have been off work, and the company is currently down about 12%, he says. \u201cWe have 25,000 call-centre people, and we handle all the 999 calls \u2013 which have seen a massive spike. We have 30,000 engineers out there working on the broadband and phone network. They are all key workers, and at one stage we were 4,500 down.\u201d One of the most serious issues Jansen and other telecoms companies are dealing with is the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of the virus. \u201cWe have had 45 incidents, ranging from burning masts \u2013 about 18 \u2013 to barbed wire being put around fixed poles where people saw a shiny box and thought it was 5G kit when it wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had people driving their cars at our Openreach engineers then swerving at the last minute to intimidate them, as well as verbal and physical abuse.\u201d He is scathing about the conspiracy theorists: \u201c It is more dangerous lying in the sunshine than walking past a 5G mast. It is unfounded nonsense.\u201d Jansen recognises that BT is not under the immense pressure that many businesses have found themselves under during lockdown. However, he says, its pay-TV operation is being hurt by there being no sport on air, and it will also be hit if many of the small businesses it provides telecoms services to do not survive. \u201cThe good news is everyone needs what we do,\u201d he says. People need connectivity more than ever before. But we are not immune. The two big areas are BT Sport and the impact on small and medium-sized businesses, restaurants and leisure centres and the like. We can see businesses in deep trouble, and if they fold, that will impact us. But we will weather the storm.\u201d Mark Sweney James Morris, managing director, Trafalgar Marquees Morris first realised coronavirus could be a problem in late February, when a German company cancelled its marquee booking for a corporate event in London in June. \u201cAt that point,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwe slightly shrugged it off, and said it was a bit extreme to cancel for June.\u201d But it was only the beginning. Morris would usually be gearing up for the busiest time of year for his events company, which he founded in 2007 using his student overdraft. He had, he says, the \u201cstrongest order book ever\u201d for his marquees, furniture and lighting. The company had been preparing to take on temporary staff and hire vans in April to take equipment to about six events per week, ranging from corporate meetings and outdoor opera to a food festival. Instead, he has lost \u00a3100,000 in cancelled and postponed bookings and has hurriedly tried to cut costs. \u201cOur income has just fallen off a cliff. We are doing some work for the NHS, but it doesn\u2019t really touch the sides.\u201d Morris\u2019s request for an overdraft extension from his bank \u2013 NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was refused. He has subsequently tried to apply for the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils), but the bank has told him his business is not eligible as it is \u201cnot viable\u201d. \u201cWe have invested heavily back in the business, so we have made a loss, but that\u2019s due to our investment. All our assets are fully owned, they are not financed,\u201d says Morris. He claims NatWest has \u201cstonewalled\u201d him and looked only at Trafalgar\u2019s accounts for the last six months, including the quiet winter period, which he says is unrepresentative. Morris had six weeks\u2019 worth of cash in the bank before the shutdown. But four weeks after trade disappeared, the money is now running out. He warns: \u201cWe are not in a unique position, we will be one of thousands.\u201d Joanna Partridge Neil Clifford, chief executive, Kurt Geiger A sunny Easter would normally have meant strong sales of strappy sandals and trainers at Kurt Geiger shoe shops. Instead, sales are down by two-thirds after the company closed its stores a few days ahead of last month\u2019s high street lockdown. Chief executive Neil Clifford says online trade is up 10% \u2013 led by an 80% jump in sales of slippers as the nation stays indoors \u2013 but it\u2019s nowhere near enough to offset the lost store sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocker. I used to be depressed by a 10% drop; now I look and it\u2019s down 66%,\u201d he says. Clifford reckons it will take three years to rebuild to where Kurt Geiger started the year \u2013 on a high with record takings of nearly \u00a3400m, underlying profits of \u00a340m and 10 new shops planned. It is hoped shops will be able to reopen in June, and summer stock sold in July and August. But in the meantime Kurt Geiger has slashed costs where possible, freezing rents and benefiting from the business rates holiday. It has had to cancel orders, delay shipments and try to repurpose materials, such as leather ordered for summer footwear, into styles appropriate for autumn. Despite that, it has mountains of stock which is unlikely to sell this year, though some will be held until next spring or summer. Clifford has been encouraging employees not required at work to volunteer for the NHS. He is offering 50% discounts for health workers and giving away 2 million pairs of shoes to NHS staff. He is also not drawing a salary until stores reopen, and expects to ask higher-paid staff to take a pay cut next month. But he is topping up the pay of the 83% of employees who are furloughed.

Rhythwyn Evans had completed 21 laps of the property, on Tan-y-Graig Farm, in Silian, Ceredigion, before breakfast on Saturday \u2013 his 91st birthday. The grandfather, who uses a walking stick, has already raised more than \u00a312,000 for his local health board charity. Evans said he had lived to a \u201cripe old age\u201d and wanted \u201cto give something back to the community\u201d. Evans began the challenge in solidarity with Capt Tom Moore, who has raised more than \u00a323m so far for NHS Charities Together by walking laps of his garden to mark his 100th birthday. On a JustGiving page, Evans\u2019s family said he had celebrated his 90th birthday with family, neighbours and friends, but wanted to do something different to give something back to the community during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cInspired by and in solidarity with Capt Tom Moore, he has set a personal challenge to walk around his home 91 times in one day, to help beat the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d they wrote. \u201cRhythwyn would like to support his local health board, Hywel Dda, to show his gratitude for the outstanding work of the workers in these extremely challenging times.\u201d Money raised by the nonagenarian will go to the Hywel Dda NHS Covid-19 appeal, organised by Hywel Dda Health Charities. Evans has already smashed his original target of \u00a31,000. Sarah Jennings, the director of partnerships and corporate services for Hywel Dda University health board, said they were \u201cextremely grateful\u201d for his support. \u201cThis is such an incredible thing to do to celebrate a special birthday and we thank Mr Evans and his supporters for helping to fund vital items urgently needed for the welfare and wellbeing of staff and volunteers,\u201d she said. \u201cPenblwydd Hapus (Happy Birthday) from all at Hywel Dda.\u201d",

On Friday, Trump went on a bizarre, all-caps Twitter rampage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">calling on citizens</a> to \u201cLIBERATE\u201d Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia from state quarantine measures.</p> <p>Many Republican governors have responded by following the president\u2019s lead. Even as the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert was <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/top-us-disease-expert-backs-nationwide-lockdown\">pleading</a> for a nationwide lockdown, governors like Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis chose to sacrifice the health of their constituents on the altar of their desire to please the president.</p> <p>When DeSantis did eventually issue a stay-at-home order, he explicitly cited Trump\u2019s changing \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/01/politics/desantis-florida-coronavirus/index.html\">demeanor</a>\u201d as his reason for doing so. Other Republican governors took their cues from the federal government too, for instance by waiting for Trump to issue a national emergency declaration before they issued their own. Some Republican governors \u2013 such as Mike DeWine of Ohio and Larry Hogan of Maryland \u2013 acted earlier, but they represent states in which Trump\u2019s popularity is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/democratic-governors-are-quicker-in-responding-to-the-coronavirus-than-republicans-135599\">much lower than average</a> among Republican-governed states.</p> <p>Democratic governors have been more in tune with the needs of their localities than the president\u2019s shifting moods, issuing emergency declarations and lockdown orders sooner than their Republican counterparts. When their pleas for a more effective federal response were ignored, they turned to self-help instead. As it becomes clear that Trump is pushing for an irresponsible reopening of the economy, Democratic governors in the west and north-east have established <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/democrats-governors-states-coronavirus-outbreak\">working groups</a> consisting of public health experts and economists to plot their own way forward.</p> <p>Why did Republican governors stick with the president while Democratic governors went their own way?

The warning came in response to new guidance from Public Health England, revealed by the Guardian on Friday, which instructs healthcare workers to reuse disposable PPE and recommends that medics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">wear aprons if they </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">are unable to access full-length gowns</a>. There are growing concerns that some PPE supplies are dangerously close to running out. </li> <li><strong>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll rose by 888 in the last 24 hours to 15,464.</strong> Broken down by devolved administration, the figures stand at 13,918 in England, 893 in Scotland, 534 in Wales and 193 in Northern Ireland.<br></li> <li><strong>The Queen\u2019s 94th birthday on Tuesday will not be marked in any special way</strong> because the monarch felt it would be \u201cinappropriate in the current circumstances\u201d, a Buckingham Palace source said.

The funds would help councils fund services including adult social care, children\u2019s services, waste collection and care for the most vulnerable people. An additional \u00a3300m would also go to the devolved administrations using the Barnett formula. </li> <li><strong>Close family must be able to attend funerals and cemeteries and graveyards must remain open</strong>, Jenrick said. As long as physical distancing was adhered to, family member must have the opportunity to say goodbye to their loved ones, he said. </li> <li><strong>All parks are to remain open</strong>, but people must continue to abide by physical distancing rules, Jenrick said. Parks were vital for maintaining the mental and physical health of people for whom the lockdown was even harder, such as those with less living space or without a garden.</li> <li><strong>Arcadia Group may permanently shut stores closed by lockdown</strong>. Sir Philip Green\u2019s fashion group, whose brands include Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/18/arcadia-group-may-permanently-shut-down-stores-amid-covid-19-crisis\">served notice on its landlords to walk away from stores</a> whose leases have rolling breaks or are due to expire.</li> </ul> <p>Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with tips and stories, advice and suggestions, poems and love letters.

The warning came in response to new guidance from Public Health England, revealed by the Guardian on Friday, which instructs healthcare workers to reuse disposable PPE and recommends that medics wear aprons if they are unable to access full-length gowns. There are growing concerns that some PPE supplies are dangerously close to running out. The UK\u2019s hospital death toll rose by 888 in the last 24 hours to 15,464. Broken down by devolved administration, the figures stand at 13,918 in England, 893 in Scotland, 534 in Wales and 193 in Northern Ireland. The Queen\u2019s 94th birthday on Tuesday will not be marked in any special way because the monarch felt it would be \u201cinappropriate in the current circumstances\u201d, a Buckingham Palace source said. It is thought to be the first time the occasion will go unmarked by gun salutes. Councils across England are to receive an extra \u00a31.6bn in funding to help them cope with increased pressures brought about by the pandemic, the local government secretary Robert Jenrick announced. The funds would help councils fund services including adult social care, children\u2019s services, waste collection and care for the most vulnerable people. An additional \u00a3300m would also go to the devolved administrations using the Barnett formula. Close family must be able to attend funerals and cemeteries and graveyards must remain open, Jenrick said. As long as physical distancing was adhered to, family member must have the opportunity to say goodbye to their loved ones, he said. All parks are to remain open, but people must continue to abide by physical distancing rules, Jenrick said. Parks were vital for maintaining the mental and physical health of people for whom the lockdown was even harder, such as those with less living space or without a garden. Arcadia Group may permanently shut stores closed by lockdown. Sir Philip Green\u2019s fashion group, whose brands include Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, has served notice on its landlords to walk away from stores whose leases have rolling breaks or are due to expire.

In more positive news, inmates at HMP Guys Marsh in Dorset are sewing 500 items for nurses at Yeovil hospital, following donations of materials and sewing machines from local villagers. In need of a project for the prisoners, who are under even stricter confinement than usual due to lockdown and physical distancing measures, and wanting to help the NHS, the prison contacted Yeovil hospital to ask what they needed. Delighted, the hospital asked for 500 items including nurses scrubs and laundry bags. With there being only one sewing machine between the men, the local community was called upon to get involved with the project. People from the village of Marnhull donated several machines and local businesses donated fabric in the form of spare duvets and sheets, binding, buttons and elastic to get the initiative started. The Honesty Jar, a local second-hand share shop, also set up a marquee outside the store \u2013 of course closed during lockdown \u2013 so people could help themselves to fabric which was then delivered to the men at Guys Marsh. Jenrick was asked about concerns over undocumented migrants who have developed symptoms and are too afraid to seek medical help, either because of their immigration status or fears of deportation. Asked whether the government would respond to calls for NHS immigration checks to be dropped, he said: I have heard a number of representations about those people who do not currently have recourse to public funds, who have come in undocumented ways from other countries. The government policy on that hasn\u2019t changed. But there is the ability for local councils to make sensible decisions based on the risk to life that there may be in a small number of cases, and that\u2019s the way I know many councils regularly treat real concerns, for example with rough sleepers in winter, it\u2019s the way that those councils would approach this situation as well. Powis says the falling number of hospital admissions is encouraging, but that is only happening because people are following physical distancing measures. This is not the time to rest on our laurels, to think that we got on the front foot and therefore can stop complying with instructions. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. Jenrick says Boris Johnson continues to rest and recuperate at Chequers. He has had \u201csome contact with ministers\u201d but mainly with his office in Downing Street. Jenrick says be believes the NHS currently has 10,606 ventilators, of which 190 have come from new UK suppliers. Powis says getting the real number of infections in the community is best done by testing for antibodies to find out how many people have had the virus and developed an immune response. He says these tests are still being worked out and that we still don\u2019t understand how antibodies are produced in people who have had Covid-19. Powis says he understands we now have a good supply of FFP3 face masks. Jenrick maintains he did not break physical distancing rules when he visited his parents to drop off medical supplies and food. He also says he returns to Westminster for work and stays with his family in Herefordshire. Here is the story if you need refresh yourself of the claims: Jenrick says more needs to be done to get the PPE required to the frontline. He cited \u201cglobal demand\u201d as making this a challenge. He says a significant consignment of PPE is due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday, which will include 400,000 gowns. As well as large brands such as Burberry and Barbour, many small and medium-sized companies were also rising to the challenge of helping the NHS by producing PPE. Any businesses that feels they \u201chave not been listened to\u201d in terms of offering to produce PPE should \u201cget back in touch\u201d with the government, he says. Powis says PPE is a very personal issue for him as a doctor. He says the guidance was professionally agreed two weeks ago for that stage of the epidemic. He says he knew the government was working hard but it is absolutely critical \u201cabove anything else\u201d to get supplies of PPE to the frontline. They are taking questions from the media now. Jenrick says the virus does appear to be having a disproportionate impact on BAME communities in the UK, as in the US. He said research must be done swiftly and action taken. Powis says he is very concerned about the issue and supports the move by Public Health England to investigate the matter. He notes that a significant number of NHS staff come from ethnic minorities and it\u2019s important that work is done as quickly as possible. Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, is speaking now. He says the use of transport continues to decline, both in public transport and private vehicles. He says the number of new infections is \u201cstabilising\u201d and that the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 was beginning to fall. He says these are encouraging signs \u201cbut still early\u201d, and that it is critical we all continue to comply with physical distancing measures. The number of deaths will be the last to change, but will do so if distancing measures continue, he says. Jenrick said families must have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones and that close members could attend funerals providing they adhere to physical distancing measures. Cemeteries and graveyards must remain open, he said, not for people to congregate but for them \u201cto seek solace\u201d or lay flowers. He said these were small mercies that made life more liveable and more humane in the current circumstances. Jenrick said there had been examples of parks across the country closing. He acknowledged that the lockdown was harder for people with less living space, or without a garden. \u201cPeople need parks,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the health of the nation, people must abide by social distancing rules and not congregate in those parks.\u201d Jenrick said more than 90% of rough sleepers had been offered accommodation, and thanked local councils, charities and others. He said there was \u201ca small number, regrettably, still rough sleeping\u201d. He paid tribute to \u201cheroic\u201d Capt Tom Moore who has raised \u00a323m for the NHS. He will be a guest of honour at the opening of the NHS Nightingale in Harrogate next week. Jenrick said three weeks after the initial announcement, 250,000 packages of essential items had been delivered to \u201cthe most clinically vulnerable people\u201d. He also said 300,000 more boxes were expected to be delivered this week to those who are shielding. The department\u2019s call centre is making up to 330,000 calls a day to check on those who are shielding and see if they need a priority slot with their local supermarket. Jenrick announced an additional \u00a31.6bn to help councils cope with increased pressures caused by the coronavirus crisis in areas including adult social care, children\u2019s services, care for the most vulnerable and waste collection. The funding takes the total given to councils to help them through the pandemic to \u00a33.2bn, he said. He also said \u00a32.6bn in business rates payments would be deferred to central government. He added an extra \u00a3300m will go to devolved administrations through the Barnett Formula, with Scotland getting \u00a3155m, Wales \u00a395m, and Northern Ireland \u00a350m. Robert Jenrick, the local government secretary, is speaking now. 460,437 tests have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 21,389 tests carried out yesterday. 114,217 people have tested positive, an increase of 5,526 cases since yesterday. 17,759 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 18,711 yesterday. Of those admitted to hospital, 15,464 have died, an increase of 888 fatalities in 24 hours. More than 100,000 reusable face masks are being flown into Yorkshire from Vietnam for the NHS, the Yorkshire Post reports. The MP for Wakefield, Imran Khan, used his own connections to arrange the delivery, which will go to the three hospitals covered by the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust when they arrive in the UK this week. It is understood 10,000 will also be distributed by the trust to care homes and hospices. The government\u2019s daily press briefing is due to begin shortly and will be fronted by the local government secretary, Robert Jenrick. He is expected to be joined by Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. An NHS nurse has criticised Matt Hancock after her eight-year-old daughter begged her not to continue working in A&amp;E during the coronavirus pandemic. Kate, who did not want her surname published, has worked in the NHS for 25 years and in February returned to a more hands-on role. However, since the coronavirus outbreak unfolded in the UK, the 44-year-old has campaigned against Public Health England\u2019s guidance during the crisis, and her daughter is concerned for her mother\u2019s safety. Kate tweeted the health secretary on Friday that her child had gone to bed \u201csobbing and begging me not to work in A&amp;E\u201d, adding: \u201cHer words broke me, \u2018Mummy I\u2019m only eight and I need you, I don\u2019t want you to die\u2019,\u201d Kate told the PA news agency: I was so angry. How dare he put us in this position. I can\u2019t even reassure her without lying that I\u2019ve got enough equipment to keep me safe at work. Actually the reality is I\u2019ve been going to work for weeks in a crap plastic pinny and a basic surgical mask. I can\u2019t even reassure her effectively without lying that we\u2019ve got everything that we need. A British Medical Association survey of more than 6,000 doctors across the country said a significant number are still without the protection they need to guard against Covid-19. Another survey by the Royal College of Nursing found that 50% nurses had felt pressure to work without appropriate protective equipment during the crisis. Kate added: I\u2019m very careful to not expose my children to anything. However, they listen to the radio, news is out there, they see the 5pm briefing, they understand. They know they\u2019re all off school because of the massive risks of [the virus], so it\u2019s weighing heavily on their minds anyway. I\u2019ve stopped sharing a bed with my daughter, I considered moving out, I thought \u2018is that the best thing?\u2019 I\u2019ve moved downstairs into the spare room, and then when I put her to bed last night she\u2019s sobbing her little heart out. A farmer is raising money for the NHS by walking 91 laps around his bungalow on his 91st birthday. Rhythwyn Evans had completed 21 laps of the property in Ceredigion before breakfast on Saturday. The grandfather, who uses a walking stick, has already raised more than 11,000 for his local health board charity. He said he had lived to a \u201cripe old age\u201d and wanted \u201cto give something back to the community\u201d. Evans was inspired by Captain Tom Moore, who has raised more than \u00a323m for NHS Charities Together by walking laps of his garden to mark his 100th birthday. Money raised by Evans will go to the Hywel Dda NHS Covid-19 Appeal, organised by Hywel Dda Health Charities. He originally aimed to raise \u00a31,000 but quickly passed this target. Sarah Jennings, director of partnerships and corporate services for Hywel Dda University Health Board, said they were \u201cextremely grateful\u201d for Evans\u2019s support. She said: This is such an incredible thing to do to celebrate a special birthday and we thank Mr Evans and his supporters for helping to fund vital items urgently needed for the welfare and wellbeing of staff and volunteers. Penblwydd Hapus (Happy Birthday) from all at Hywel Dda. Here is his JustGiving page. The Royal College of Surgeons has joined condemnation of new guidance which means doctors and nurses in England could be asked to work without full-length gowns and to reuse items when treating coronavirus patients. Prof Neil Mortensen, president-elect of the college, echoed advice from the Royal College of Nursing that nurses should refuse to treat patients \u201cas a last resort\u201d if they are not provided with adequate PPE. Mortensen said the NHS guidance, rushed out on Friday amid fears some supplies could run out this weekend, was deeply disturbing and was issued without consulting expert medical bodies. He added: The new guidance implies that, even in the operating theatre, surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE. This is simply unacceptable. He said that, like all doctors, surgeons are committed to their patients and many will put themselves in the line of fire. However, if fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls are not available, then surgeons should not risk their health. A small group of independent designers and makers have launched an urgent crowdfunding campaign to produce 200 medical gowns for London medics. Each single-use, splash-proof gown costs \u00a330 to make. You can find more information and donate to the cause here. Here is some much-needed mid-afternoon positive news! Capt Tom Moore and Michael Ball have topped the iTunes chart with their charity single You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone, mere hours after the track was released. The 99-year-old veteran has raised almost \u00a323m for the NHS by walking lengths of his garden. He was aiming to reach 100 laps by his 100th birthday at the end of the month, but has since passed that target and plans to keep going as long as the donations continue. NHS England has announced 784 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 13,918. Of the 784 new deaths announced on Saturday: 150 occurred on 17 April. 320 occurred on 16 April. 101 occurred on 15 April. 187 occurred between 1 and 14 April. 26 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest being on 14 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be done, and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Saturday by NHS England show 8 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day - 799 - although this could change in future updates. A further 17 people in Northern Ireland have died in hospital settings with coronavirus in the past day, the Public Health Agency said. This brings the total number of confirmed deaths in hospital settings in the region to 193. Public Health Wales has announced a further 28 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities in Wales to 534. The new deaths, by health board area, are: five in Aneurin Bevan, one in Cardiff and Vale, 19 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and two in Swansea Bay, with one death elsewhere in Wales. There have been a total of 6,936 confirmed cases in Wales, a rise of 292, while 24,114 tests have been carried out on 20,766 individuals. A total of 893 people who tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland have died, a rise of 56 on Friday\u2019s figure, according to the Scottish Government. Across the country, 38,233 people have now been tested for Covid-19, with 7,820 testing positive. As of Friday night, 1,793 patients were in hospital with either confirmed or suspected coronavirus, a decrease of six. Of those, 182 were being treated in intensive care units, down seven from the previous night. As of 9am on 18 April, 15,464 people have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care said. That is a rise of 888, up from 14,576 the day before. As of 9am on Saturday, 357,023 people had been tested, of which 114,217 proved positive. Overall, 460,437 tests have been done, with 21,389 tests on Friday, excluding data from Northern Ireland. Rachel Harrison, national officer of the GMB union, has said that faith in the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is \u201cdraining away\u201d after Public Health England changed its personal protective equipment guidance on Friday. Harrison told PA Media the union raised critical protective equipment supply issues with the government more than a month ago. She said: It took until last Friday for ministers\u2019 PPE plan to be published, and it\u2019s falling apart after just a week. It is key workers on the frontline who are paying the price for this litany of failure. It appears government guidance is being hastily redrawn based on availability, not on evidence or best practice. This is downright dangerous territory and one that will amplify the concerns of NHS staff. The health secretary now has serious and urgent questions to answer. Trust is draining away. She added that the union would not tolerate a situation where its members are \u201cpushed on to the frontline without the basic kit they need to do their jobs safely\u201d. A campaign to thank NHS staff for their work during the coronavirus crisis has raised \u00a31m. More than 200,000 people have supported the OneMillionClaps campaign in a week by donating \u00a35 to send a personal message of support to NHS workers. ITV, the official broadcast partner for the campaign, dedicated a day of broadcasting messages to frontline NHS staff. OneMillionClaps is part of an appeal launched two weeks ago by NHS Charities Together, the official umbrella organisation for NHS charities. Donations will be used to provide a range of supplies and support for NHS staff, volunteers and patients - including food, travel, accommodation, mobile devices to keep in touch with family and friends, and mental health support and counselling. Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, whose brands include Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, could permanently shut some of its shops as the coronavirus pandemic puts pressure on high street retailers. The fashion group has served notice on its landlords to walk away from stores whose leases have rolling breaks or are due to expire. Here is the full report: Undocumented migrants are being deterred from seeking medical attention during the coronavirus pandemic for fear of being reported to immigration authorities, MPs have said. A cross-party group of 60 MPs has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, calling for the suspension of healthcare charges for migrants and NHS data sharing with immigration enforcement. The letter cites the case of a Filipino migrant, known only as Elvis, who died last week while self-isolating at home with Covid-19 symptoms. He did not seek care \u201cfearing that he would be charged thousands of pounds for his treatment, or that he would face immigration enforcement if he tried to access care,\u201d it read. MPs said that Elvis\u2019s wife also had the virus and was not seeking help for the same reasons. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, one of three Labour MPs who coordinated the letter, said: The government must listen to frontline health workers and medical organisations calling for immediate action to stop people being deterred from healthcare. The NHS was founded on the idea that healthcare should be available to all who need it, regardless of where they\u2019re from or their ability to pay. The government\u2019s hostile approach to migrants goes against these founding principles. Unapproved antibody tests could increase people\u2019s risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, the UK\u2019s national testing coordinator has said. Countries around the globe are scrambling to develop reliable antibody tests that can detect if people have had the virus and may be immune in the hope that it might allow lockdown restrictions to be eased, but efforts so far have been unsuccessful. Reports have emerged that organisations and individuals are trying to acquire testing kits that are likely to yield false results. John Newton, the national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, believes efforts to develop accurate tests look promising, but said that misleading results of unapproved tests could increase the risk of becoming ill or spreading the virus. My colleague Jedidajah Otte has the full report: Tributes have been paid to a staff member at Greater Manchester police who died after contracting Covid-19. Marcia Pryce, 61, died on 2 April. She had worked for the force for more than 30 years, most recently in its intelligence bureau. Her sister, Amira Asantewa, said: Marcia was a powerhouse, a positive influence in my life and the lives of the many people she knew and loved. She didn\u2019t have children of her own, but she had more godchildren than we can count and they meant so much to her. Many are now adults but still refer to her lovingly as \u2018Aunty Marce\u2019. She taught us how to be independent and pursue your goals, even if no-one believed in you or them; how to enjoy life and connect with people from all walks of life. Hundreds of Britons stuck in Bangladesh will be repatriated after the government chartered four flights as part of a new push to to bring more than 7,000 UK citizens home from South Asia. Those deemed most at risk from coronavirus, such as the sick and elderly, will be given priority, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said. As many as 850 Britons are expected to board the flights, which will leave the capital, Dhaka, for London on 21, 23, 25 and 26 April, the FCO said. Tickets will cost \u00a3600 a person and travellers will also be able to board transfer flights to the capital from Sylhet, in the north-east of the country. The government had earlier announced 17 chartered flights from India and 10 from Pakistan, expected to bring home around 4,000 and 2,500 passengers respectively. The services are being part-funded by the government\u2019s \u00a375m scheme to organise flights from countries where commercial flights have been stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic. Britons wanting to book a spot can do so here. This is from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Thank you so much to everybody who has been in touch throughout the morning with tips and suggestions. I love reading through them all, especially the ones thanking the Guardian for its coverage of this crisis. Please do continue to get in touch as the day goes on via the usual channels (below) and apologies if I cannot respond to you all individually. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ This, from the FT\u2019s Peter Foster, is one of the best things you will read today. In essence: The government needs to show some HUMILITY. It needs to LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW STUFF. I think this is a clear example of where it did not. DC John Coker has died in hospital after coming down with symptoms of coronavirus on 22 March, British Transport Police said. In a statement, BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said his thoughts were with Coker\u2019s family after the 53-year-old passed away last night following an \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d three weeks. He said: John was taken ill on 22 March with symptoms of coronavirus. After his health did not improve he was admitted to hospital and transferred to an intensive care unit to receive critical treatment. Despite the best efforts of hospital staff, John\u2019s health did not improve, and he passed away on 17 April. John has been part of the BTP family for over a decade and became a detective constable within the CID department at Euston where he was much loved and respected by all those he worked with. His colleagues remember a man who was charismatic, kind and thoughtful and took everything in his stride. He will be greatly missed by all in the force. He is survived by his wife and their three children. NHS frontline staff may refuse to work if there is not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure their safety, the UK\u2019s biggest union has warned. The warning came in response to new guidance from Public Health England, revealed by the Guardian on Friday, which instructs healthcare workers to reuse disposable PPE. The guidelines also recommended that medics wear aprons if they are unable to access full-length gowns, and there are concerns that some PPE supplies are close to running out. Sara Gorton, the head of health at Unison, said: If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it\u2019s no longer safe for them to work. No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks. That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure. Here is the full story. The Queen\u2019s birthday on Tuesday will not be marked by gun salutes for what is believed will be the first time, due to the coronavirus crisis, PA Media news agency reports. A Buckingham Palace source said the Queen\u2019s 94th birthday will not be marked in any special way, adding that any calls with family will be kept private. The source said: There will be no gun salutes - Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances. This is from the foreign secretary (or rather, his son). The government\u2019s programme to release up to 4,000 low-risk prisoners early to help jails cope with coronavirus has been paused after six inmates were freed by mistake. The inmates were candidates for early release but were let out too soon because of an \u201cadministrative error\u201d, the Ministry of Justice said. After the flaw was spotted, they all \u201creturned compliantly to prison\u201d, a spokeswoman added. The scheme, designed to avoid thousands of often cell-sharing inmates becoming infected, was paused on Thursday and is due to resume next week. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in half of the prisons in England and Wales. A total of 255 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 in 62 jails as of 5pm on Thursday, the MoJ said, and 13 inmates had died. Some 138 prison staff have also contracted the virus in 49 prisons, as well as seven prisoner escort and custody services staff. And 700 staff have been tested and 6,268 are self-isolating, according to the latest available figures. The inmates were let out of two open category D prisons \u2013 Leyhill in Gloucestershire and Sudbury in Derbyshire \u2013 along with one inmate from the Isis category C prison for young offenders in south-east London. The shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the error was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and called for it to be \u201cquickly understood and remedied\u201d. The culture secretary Oliver Dowden has asked the public to \u201cadd one small thing\u201d to their to-do list and buy a newspaper as the press grapples \u201cwith the biggest existential crisis in its history\u201d. The newspaper business has come under increasing strain amid the coronavirus pandemic, with falling advertising revenue and declining circulation. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest publishers have cut wages for staff in the latest round of measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis. The Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which owns the Mail, Metro and the i newspaper titles, has imposed a pay cut on all staff earning more than \u00a340,000 a year. And Reach, the owner of the Mirror and Express papers, said all staff will receive a pay cut of at least 10% due to heavy falls in advertising and circulation. Dowden has also instructed brands including Sky, Amazon and Tesco to end \u201cad-blocking\u201d on online news articles about the pandemic and allow their adverts to appear next to coronavirus news stories. The Times (paywall) has the story. Human trials of a potential vaccine have begun at Oxford University and trials could be completed by mid-August, Prof John Bell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. Bell, who is a member of the government\u2019s vaccine taskforce, said the possibility of a vaccine being produced by the autumn depended on efficacy. He said: [The question is] will it protect people, and that has not been tested, and it will only be tested once you have vaccinated a significant number of people and exposed them to the virus and counted how many people have got the virus in that population. So, we won\u2019t even get a signal for that until May. But if things go on course and it does have efficacy, then I think it is reasonable to think that they would be able to complete their trial by mid-August. He said it would be \u201cgame on\u201d if they were to see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or end of May, with the possibility of getting \u201cacross the finish line\u201d by mid-August. However, there would then be the challenge of manufacturing at scale the billions of doses needed. The push to develop a vaccine quickly was based on scientists wanting to test it on current cases, Bell added. He said: One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few cases until we get a second wave. The team developing the vaccine are very keen to get it out in its trial now so that we can catch the remainder of this wave. Good morning everybody. Thousands of doctors and nurses are concerned about inadequate supplies of personal protection equipment (PPE) amid fears some hospitals could run out entirely this weekend. A British Medical Association survey of more than 6,000 doctors across the country said a significant amount of them remain without the protection they need to guard against Covid-19. Meanwhile another survey by the Royal College of Nursing found half of nurses have felt pressure to work without appropriate protective equipment during the crisis. It comes after it was revealed that doctors and nurses in England will be asked to work without full-length gowns and to reuse items when treating patients with coronavirus ahead of expected shortages of protective garments, prompting outrage from unions. The story, from our health editor Denis Campbell, is on the Guardian\u2019s front page today. The U-turn on Public Health England guidelines saw doctors and nurses told to work without full-length protective gowns \u2013 and to use flimsy plastic aprons instead \u2013 when treating patients with Covid-19, as hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies. The full story is here. On Friday, the health secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons health committee that he would \u201clove to be able to wave a magic wand\u201d to increase PPE supplies. He said the equipment was a \u201cprecious resource\u201d and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the very high global demand. At least 50 NHS workers have now died after contracting the virus. Here are some of their stories. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK coronavirus developments as the day unfolds.

      "body": "<p>Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.</p> <p>A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.</p> <h2><strong>World\u2019s most trafficked mammal</strong></h2> <p>Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.</p> <p>There are eight species of <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/pangolin\">pangolin</a>. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Two of the African species are <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12766/123586126\">considered</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12765/123585768\">vulnerable</a> and two <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12767/123586469\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12762/123584478\">endangered</a>. Of the Asian species, one is <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12761/123583998\">endangered</a> while the other three <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12764/123585318\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12763/123584856\">critically</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/136497/123586862\">endangered</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If animals are in closely packed, unsanitary conditions with many people nearby it is easier for a virus to jump species</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pangolins are <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11855-Podcast-Why-are-pangolins-so-prized-in-China-\">illegally hunted and traded</a> for <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11538-Pangolins-The-multimillion-dollar-mammal\">two main reasons</a>. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/20/scale-of-pangolin-slaughter-revealed-millions-hunted-in-central-africa-alone\">the world\u2019s most trafficked mammals</a>.</p> <p>The idea that pangolins gave us Covid-19 emerged <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00364-2\">at a press conference</a> given by the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou on 7 February. Two scientists there, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2004160486_Yongyi_Shen\">Yongyi Shen</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_0mQSasAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Lihua Xiao</a>, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses\u2019 genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979\">Sunda pangolins carry coronaviruses</a>.</p> <p>However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail.

      "bodyText": "Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation. A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source. World\u2019s most trafficked mammal Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats. There are eight species of pangolin. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Two of the African species are considered vulnerable and two are endangered. Of the Asian species, one is endangered while the other three are critically endangered. Pangolins are illegally hunted and traded for two main reasons. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are the world\u2019s most trafficked mammals. The idea that pangolins gave us Covid-19 emerged at a press conference given by the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou on 7 February. Two scientists there, Yongyi Shen and Lihua Xiao, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses\u2019 genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that Sunda pangolins carry coronaviruses. However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. Many pointed the finger at bats: the virus is genetically similar to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also a study linking the virus to one found in snakes, but this is now considered unlikely. Then there was a twist in the story. On 20 February the researchers posted a preliminary version of the study on the preprint site bioRxiv. The conclusions were radically different to what was described at the press conference. While the pangolin virus was \u201cgenetically related\u201d to the one infecting humans, it was \u201cunlikely to be directly linked to the outbreak because of the substantial sequence differences\u201d. The 99% similarity was only in one region of the genome. Across the entire genome, the similarity was only 90.3%. There had been an \u201cembarrassing miscommunication between the bioinformatics group and the lab group of the study\u201d. When contacted by the Observer, Xiao declined to comment. A halt to the wildlife trade? However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins. Officials began shutting down wild animal markets across the country. This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned by the 183 nations that signed up to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible. However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says Xu Ling, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. The trade continues but the nature of the shipments has changed. \u201cBefore 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,\u201d says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being illicitly shipped out via Nigeria. More recently, in August 2019, China\u2019s state insurance providers announced that they would stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales. The move took effect in January 2020. Against this background, it is unclear what impact China\u2019s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. \u201cEven without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,\u201d says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, as so often happens, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market. The truth about pangolins and Covid-19 Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away. On 17 March, a team led by Kristian Andersen at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, published a detailed analysis of the virus\u2019s possible origin in Nature Medicine. They say the ultimate source is likely to be bats, just as it was for the two other coronavirus outbreaks of recent years: Sars and Mers. Bats are a known reservoir of coronaviruses.

      "body": "<p><br><br>In forthcoming journals of this plague year, I hope whoever gets to write the canonical version will make a particular note of 15 April. This was the day the Duchess of York, ex-wife of Prince Andrew and ex-host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-what-you-need-to-know\">to the late Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the child sex offender, used the crisis to relaunch herself as the lockdown kiddies\u2019 choice.</p> <p>Introducing <em>Storytime </em><em>with Fergie and Friends</em>, the Duchess, surrounded by soft toys, said children needed \u201ca little bit of magic\u201d. She was, she confided, in the Windsor home she shares with a host of novelty teapots and also Prince Andrew (whose <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-01-29/prince-andrew-told-to-give-sworn-testimony-to-help-jeffrey-epstein-victims-find-peace/\">testimony </a>is still sought by a number of Epstein\u2019s victims), in her \u201cfavourite place ever\u2026 with children\u201d.</p> <p>Her horrendous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juJg7aVfG4s\">reading</a> of <em>Hairy Maclary From Donaldson\u2019s Dairy</em>, featuring one shriek so unhallowed that a doggie soft toy seemed, hurling itself out of shot, to prefer extinction, had already given way, by day two, to a performance of one of her own titles, <em>Budgie Goes to Sea</em>, a rudimentary work, for the uninitiated, about a duchessomorphised helicopter.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s four books in the series,\u201d the duchess said, shoving the cover at tots whose finances may be more straitened after the recession than she imagines. \u201cAnd\u201d \u2013 anticipating the question preschoolers invariably ask about a new book \u2013 \u201cguess who the author is? Mmm, I wonder, it could be me.\u201d</p> <p>It could. And whatever the deficiencies of her performance \u2013 there may be parents At This Time who will seize the chance to reduce tiny children to mute terror \u2013 the duchess\u2019s renewed bid for recognition suggests, regardless of the prospects for Budgie\u2019s regeneration, that there has never been a better time to be a British royal.</p> <p>Pre-Covid-19, following Andrew\u2019s <em>Newsnight</em> interview and their respective Epstein associations \u2013 the duchess has <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/duchess-of-york-apologises-for-gigantic-error-of-judgement-over-debt-6574623.html\">apologised for taking a loan from the paedophile</a> \u2013 the York exes appeared fairly terminally beyond, if not rehabilitation, definitely the second panto wedding they\u2019d hoped for. Now there is <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18377053.princess-beatrice-planning-2021-wedding-lift-nations-spirits/\">talk of reviving it</a>. Contagion has, as well as reducing to a trickle the previously relentless Epstein updates, generated a surge of public deference so undiscriminating that the Yorks can reasonably hope to benefit. On Instagram, Andrew puts his head above the Windsor parapet as if he has done nothing, these past decades, except pack treats for carers, next to his never-estranged helpmeet. \u201cThe York Family are a wonderful and steadfast unit and through this crisis, are continuously helping others,\u201d oozes an aide.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody seems now to be asking who was squeezing Prince Charles's toothpaste when he had Covid-19</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As unpromising as this scheme might look, the family can surely take heart from the recent transformation of the prime minister from an inept and blubbery philanderer into something more closely resembling the glorious sun itself.

      "bodyText": "In forthcoming journals of this plague year, I hope whoever gets to write the canonical version will make a particular note of 15 April. This was the day the Duchess of York, ex-wife of Prince Andrew and ex-host to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the child sex offender, used the crisis to relaunch herself as the lockdown kiddies\u2019 choice. Introducing Storytime with Fergie and Friends, the Duchess, surrounded by soft toys, said children needed \u201ca little bit of magic\u201d. She was, she confided, in the Windsor home she shares with a host of novelty teapots and also Prince Andrew (whose testimony is still sought by a number of Epstein\u2019s victims), in her \u201cfavourite place ever\u2026 with children\u201d. Her horrendous reading of Hairy Maclary From Donaldson\u2019s Dairy, featuring one shriek so unhallowed that a doggie soft toy seemed, hurling itself out of shot, to prefer extinction, had already given way, by day two, to a performance of one of her own titles, Budgie Goes to Sea, a rudimentary work, for the uninitiated, about a duchessomorphised helicopter. \u201cThere\u2019s four books in the series,\u201d the duchess said, shoving the cover at tots whose finances may be more straitened after the recession than she imagines. \u201cAnd\u201d \u2013 anticipating the question preschoolers invariably ask about a new book \u2013 \u201cguess who the author is? Mmm, I wonder, it could be me.\u201d It could. And whatever the deficiencies of her performance \u2013 there may be parents At This Time who will seize the chance to reduce tiny children to mute terror \u2013 the duchess\u2019s renewed bid for recognition suggests, regardless of the prospects for Budgie\u2019s regeneration, that there has never been a better time to be a British royal. Pre-Covid-19, following Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview and their respective Epstein associations \u2013 the duchess has apologised for taking a loan from the paedophile \u2013 the York exes appeared fairly terminally beyond, if not rehabilitation, definitely the second panto wedding they\u2019d hoped for. Now there is talk of reviving it. Contagion has, as well as reducing to a trickle the previously relentless Epstein updates, generated a surge of public deference so undiscriminating that the Yorks can reasonably hope to benefit. On Instagram, Andrew puts his head above the Windsor parapet as if he has done nothing, these past decades, except pack treats for carers, next to his never-estranged helpmeet. \u201cThe York Family are a wonderful and steadfast unit and through this crisis, are continuously helping others,\u201d oozes an aide. As unpromising as this scheme might look, the family can surely take heart from the recent transformation of the prime minister from an inept and blubbery philanderer into something more closely resembling the glorious sun itself. But the sudden tolerance for rhapsodies about Boris Johnson\u2019s nation-binding, lie-obliterating invincibility, even from writers whose analysis does not usually recall Unity Mitford\u2019s, appears to be just one aspect of a widespread longing for comfort from on high, or wherever a significant royal is currently embedded, along with any necessary suspension of critical faculties. If it was likely and welcome that the Queen, as a revered survivor of earlier crises, would be a calming national presence in this one, the Prince of Wales possibly had less reason to hope, like his dependent son and daughter-in-law, that their contributions \u2013 from spiritual input to book lists to a throwback photograph of Prince Charles as Macbeth \u2013 would be equally gratefully received. It\u2019s not long since Charles was subjected to ritual mockery about his transport needs (including a \u00a320,000 journey from London to Port Talbot) and other disrespectful questions about his defence of a paedophile bishop. Sagewise, his alternative wisdom was not doing much better. But now a man who always wanted to be a symbol actually is a symbol. \u201cMy entire life has been so far motivated by a desire to heal,\u201d Charles said in 2002. \u201cTo heal the divisions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body and soul, so that the temple of our humanity can once again be lit by a sacred flame.\u201d And it appears the cynics were wrong: he can indeed light humanity\u2019s temple and, what\u2019s more, light it remotely, from Birkhall. Certainly, nobody seems now to be asking who\u2019s living in the prince\u2019s other seven or so homes. Or who was squeezing his toothpaste when he had Covid-19. Or where his already considerable contagion travel savings are going. In the current climate, it could sound all too much like siding with the virus.

With race income severely curtailed by coronavirus, Horner insists Liberty Media is aware of the risk and would prop up competitors if necessary.</p> <p>Nine grand prix meetings have been called off this season and with race fees a key source of income, there is genuine concern that smaller teams may not have the resources to survive. F1 fields 10 teams and has no plans for any new entries. Losing even one or two would be a major blow to the world championship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/sebastian-vettel-says-f1-will-only-resume-as-ghost-races-to-protect-staff\">Sebastian Vettel says F1 will only resume as 'ghost races' to protect staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no guarantee any races will be held in 2020 and were that the case, Horner says Liberty would act. \u201cIt could be an enormous blow and at that point the promoter has to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is their business, they have to decide how do they keep these teams alive because they need teams to go racing. The Liberty guys would do whatever they can to ensure that 10 teams are on the grid and competing next year.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to protect their own business I believe they would help to facilitate, which means paying, to ensure that those teams would be around to compete next year.\u201d</p> <p>Horner said F1\u2019s ongoing attempts to impose a lower budget cap \u2013 set at $175m in 2021 \u2013 is a misdirection for the sport, which is thinking too conservatively in its short-term efforts to control the damaging effects of the global pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/f1-decisive-action-budget-crisis-mclaren-andreas-seidl\">McLaren have argued for a decrease to $100m</a>, while F1\u2019s big three \u2013 Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari \u2013 spend more than $400m annually.</p> <p>Horner, however, says that some teams have used the budget cap debate as a chance to push their own agendas. \u201cTeams are competitive beasts, of course they are looking to use an angle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cap is a discussion about competitiveness, not about money. It\u2019s about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete. The reality is that whatever the level of spend there will always be teams that run at the front and teams that run at the back.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, the latest meeting failed to reach an agreement, with the idea of a cap of $145m, moving to $130m after a year, on the table. The big three argue their operations and development costs could not be compared with those of smaller teams and Horner insists his team cannot go below $140m. He is in favour of a two-tier cap, but also believes F1 should be more adventurous in considering how to deal with the short-term fiscal threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/f1-teams-fail-to-agree-budget-cap-reduction-as-race-cancellations-bite\">F1 fails to agree budget reduction as smaller teams at risk of being lost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we were really serious about reducing the cost, particularly for the small teams, I would be in full favour of supplying for the next two years a full customer car,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller teams wouldn\u2019t need any R&amp;D. They would run just as race teams and they would reduce their costs enormously.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of customer cars is at odds with the sport\u2019s character of every team building their own prototypes. This has not always been the case, however, and Horner argued that the sport had to think more radically. \u201cWith the modern 3D photographic technology all teams utilise they are all trying to copy each other\u2019s cars anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes change, things move. F1 used to have customer cars years ago. You could buy a car from March or from Ferrari and go racing. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to think out of the box rather than just going round and round, beating ourselves up about numbers. If this is all about saving the little teams and improving their competitiveness, it would be a very difficult to argue against the logic of a small team being able to take a customer car.\u201d</p>",

Nine grand prix meetings have been called off this season and with race fees a key source of income, there is genuine concern that smaller teams may not have the resources to survive. F1 fields 10 teams and has no plans for any new entries. Losing even one or two would be a major blow to the world championship. There is no guarantee any races will be held in 2020 and were that the case, Horner says Liberty would act. \u201cIt could be an enormous blow and at that point the promoter has to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is their business, they have to decide how do they keep these teams alive because they need teams to go racing. The Liberty guys would do whatever they can to ensure that 10 teams are on the grid and competing next year. \u201cIn order to protect their own business I believe they would help to facilitate, which means paying, to ensure that those teams would be around to compete next year.\u201d Horner said F1\u2019s ongoing attempts to impose a lower budget cap \u2013 set at $175m in 2021 \u2013 is a misdirection for the sport, which is thinking too conservatively in its short-term efforts to control the damaging effects of the global pandemic. McLaren have argued for a decrease to $100m, while F1\u2019s big three \u2013 Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari \u2013 spend more than $400m annually. Horner, however, says that some teams have used the budget cap debate as a chance to push their own agendas. \u201cTeams are competitive beasts, of course they are looking to use an angle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cap is a discussion about competitiveness, not about money. It\u2019s about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete. The reality is that whatever the level of spend there will always be teams that run at the front and teams that run at the back.\u201d On Thursday, the latest meeting failed to reach an agreement, with the idea of a cap of $145m, moving to $130m after a year, on the table. The big three argue their operations and development costs could not be compared with those of smaller teams and Horner insists his team cannot go below $140m. He is in favour of a two-tier cap, but also believes F1 should be more adventurous in considering how to deal with the short-term fiscal threat. \u201cIf we were really serious about reducing the cost, particularly for the small teams, I would be in full favour of supplying for the next two years a full customer car,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller teams wouldn\u2019t need any R&amp;D. They would run just as race teams and they would reduce their costs enormously.\u201d The concept of customer cars is at odds with the sport\u2019s character of every team building their own prototypes. This has not always been the case, however, and Horner argued that the sport had to think more radically. \u201cWith the modern 3D photographic technology all teams utilise they are all trying to copy each other\u2019s cars anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes change, things move. F1 used to have customer cars years ago. You could buy a car from March or from Ferrari and go racing. \u201cWe need to think out of the box rather than just going round and round, beating ourselves up about numbers. If this is all about saving the little teams and improving their competitiveness, it would be a very difficult to argue against the logic of a small team being able to take a customer car.\u201d",

But social distancing may last for years, until a vaccine is found or widespread community immunity is achieved. Critically, however, Australia\u2019s immediate road map is more definitive on what, rather than when. Three conditions for easing restrictions The prime minister, in an expansive press conference, outlined the three key criteria that will guide Australia\u2019s path back from Covid-19.

Contact tracing \u201clifted to an industrial capability\u201d, in the words of the prime minister, to find and isolate all of the contacts of a known infection. A key part of this will be encouraging Australians to download to their phones a tracing app, currently in production, modelled on Singapore\u2019s TraceTogether App, which uses bluetooth to alert users when they come into contact with a confirmed case.

This will include multiple layers of government agencies, including, potentially, the military. For countries that have weathered the Covid-19 storm well so far, the pressure on governments to reopen their societies and economies is intense: from business groups seeing entire industries laid barren; from political commentators reading the economic data and seeing a sea of red; from families anxious to see children back in school; from citizenry desperate to get back to work and reestablish some normality in their lives. But the risks of relaxing too much, too soon, are very real, and medical experts have warned against rushing to lift restrictions prematurely, potentially sparking a more deadly second wave and undermining the hard-won gains so far.

      "body": "<p>Term one at Australian schools did not so much end as unravel. Its final weeks were described by the New South Wales Teachers Federation as \u201cone of the most difficult school terms for the profession in living memory\u201d.</p> \n<p>Last weekend, the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, acknowledged arrangements will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">differ across states and territories</a> in term two. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/minister-education-dan-tehan-and-chief-medical-officer-professor-brendan-murphy-press\">nationally consistent approach</a> is that, when it comes to parents who have to work, when it comes to vulnerable children, schools have to be open, and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the bulk of students return, Tehan and the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, are suggesting a staggered approach. \u201cWe could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out,\u201d Gavrielatos <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/year-12-kindy-should-get-priority-when-school-goes-back-teachers-federation-20200409-p54inb.html\">said last week</a>.</p> \n<p>Until then, for many of Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4221.0\">four million students,</a> school is at home \u2013 but it\u2019s not home-schooling per se. \u201cHome-schooling is when you make, or buy, your own curriculum,\u201d says Rebecca English, a professor at Queensland University of Technology\u2019s faculty of education. \u201c[These families] are simply facilitating their children\u2019s learning at home.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">Are schools open or closed for term 2 amid coronavirus in Australia? State-by-state guide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Distance learning is the best parallel and that\u2019s been happening in rural and remote regions since Alice Springs\u2019 school of the air began via two-way radio in 1951. \u201cSchooling online isn\u2019t a revolution or a cause for concern, it\u2019s normal for thousands of children in Australia,\u201d says Philip Roberts, associate professor at the University of Canberra\u2019s faculty of education.</p> \n<p>The rapid and en masse<em> </em>switch to learning from home in March was not normal, however, and spotlighted pre-existing inequalities. \u201cThat includes students who don\u2019t have technology at home, don\u2019t have access to good broadband or don\u2019t have a supportive home environment,\u201d Prof Roberts says.</p> \n<p>Some states are trying to at least plug up the digital divide. The Victorian government is <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/victorian-students-to-learn-from-home-as-vce-timelines-revised/\">loaning</a> around 6,000 devices to students in need, and providing SIM cards or dongles to others. NSW has a <a href=\"https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/learning-from-home/leading-from-home/digital-equity-solutions#Assess0\">similar scheme</a>, prioritising year 12 students. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies, including Telstra, Optus and budget providers, are offering free bonus <a href=\"https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/every-telco-COVID-19-coronavirus-assistance-package\">data</a> and waiving late payment fees.</p> \n<p>The main stress for families not under financial strain is that parents or carers were rapidly thrust into working from home too, often full-time. Matt Levinson lives in the Sydney suburb of Rozelle with his wife, Polly, a part-time physiotherapist at a hospital, and their children, Archer, nine, and Nina, 11. The couple took their children out of Rozelle public school three weeks ago when attendance in NSW <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-schools-disruption-as-covid19-causes-online-learning/12096560\">fell</a> to around 20%.</p> \n<p>Before Covid-19 struck, Levinson\u2019s job with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees was office-based but now he\u2019s at home. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m so grateful for that,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s been stressful. \u201cThose moments when you\u2019re trying to get through work and be available to workmates as well as support your kids or, like, solve a technical problem with signing in to Zoom or [Google] classroom or whatever,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Space is tight in the family\u2019s cottage. \u201cWe got a second-hand desk for my daughter but my son and I are both at the kitchen table working. The learning environment is very much patched together.\u201d Meanwhile Levinson\u2019s work is \u201cabsolutely peaking\u201d, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a worldwide crisis around preparing for the coronavirus response in refugee settlements.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5/0_77_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Levinson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Five Dock public school principal, Amanda Dawkins, understands parents\u2019 struggle. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people out there thinking \u2018if I\u2019m not productive, I\u2019m going to lose the job\u2019.\u201d Dawkins says the wellbeing of Five Dock\u2019s school community, teachers and students is paramount and that her Monday virtual assemblies are to \u201ctry to keep kids connected at a time of great disconnect\u201d.</p> \n<p>The impact of isolation is everywhere, she says. \u201cTeachers have rung up and can\u2019t get parents off the phone because it\u2019s another adult to talk to. People are not used to being with their kids all the time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins suspects some parents may have unrealistic expectations. \u201cIf they\u2019re expecting kids to be working six hours a day, good luck with that!\u201d she says. \u201cFor older children 30 to 45 minutes at a time is enough. For the little kids, it\u2019s 15 minutes. If they\u2019re getting wriggly or poking their sibling or there\u2019s a lot of sighing going on, it\u2019s time for a break.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told families, if kids come back with the skills and knowledge they had when they left us, I\u2019m happy. If they do fall behind we\u2019ll move them forward and then some.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>English says a healthy home learning environment is low pressure with gentle limits. \u201cInvolve your child in negotiating those limits,\u201d she says. \u201cSay \u2018I need to do X today and you need to do Y. How will we manage the day?\u2019. Kids with agency are more likely to come along for the ride.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morning is best. \u201cKids start to lose the plot a bit after lunch,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if something isn\u2019t working, or they\u2019re not understanding the work, let it go. You always have tomorrow.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling with the volume of work being sent home \u2013 and some of what I\u2019m hearing from the private schools is just incredibly onerous \u2013 then tell the teachers. They are still your touchstone if you get stuck with anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>High school teachers have up to 100 students across multiple classes,so be patient, English says. \u201cThis is the first time teachers have had to do this. Everyone\u2019s finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other and with ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Samantha Thomas is the mother of a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who attend a public high school in Melbourne. Thomas had arranged time off work to transition her children but was pleasantly surprised at the school\u2019s implementation of remote learning. \u201cIt\u2019s clear a really significant amount of work was done to create structured lessons that engage the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so smooth that I\u2019ve still been able to get quite a bit of work done myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Key to her 12-year-old\u2019s success is how he\u2019s connected with a friend. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working as a pair \u2013 he\u2019s taken it onto himself to do that. It\u2019s been interesting to hear them help and motivate each other with work or things they don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a really great skill for kids to learn as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both children workshopped a way to stay active by playing basketball in their lunch break. Again, says Thomas, it was their idea \u2013 not hers. \u201cAs a parent I probably underestimated their ability to problem solve and overcome challenges, including adapting to this new environment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With children Nina and Archer, Levinson and his wife are encouraging longer-term projects steered by the children. \u201cTheir set work doesn\u2019t fill whole days and they can\u2019t go and play with their friends. So we\u2019re doing some fun creative projects that last a few days or weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re working on some power points to convince us of a few things \u2026 we\u2019re setting up a vegetable garden. We\u2019ll keep some of the school structure over the holiday because all the other structure has kind of disappeared.\u201d</p> \n<p>Encouraging kids to pursue their own interests is a great idea for older kids too, English says. \u201cIt\u2019s agency and self-determination over their learning that they probably don\u2019t get at school. This time could potentially be a real boon. Everything is so siloed in school but I think we should be thinking more about integrating curriculum areas. We know from the research it\u2019s more interesting for students and teachers.</p> \n<p>Baking and gardening are examples, she says. \u201cWith baking a cake there\u2019s fractions and mass, mathematical concepts. Recipes are procedural texts and then you have elements of science, like, \u2018how does exposing this particular concoction to heat change it?\u2019. There is humanities and social sciences if you talk about your own baking experiences. You talk about intergenerationality and tell stories, which relates back to English.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins says it will be interesting when all the students come back. \u201cThe kids at school have become quite close. It\u2019s really nice, they\u2019re playing together and working together.\u201d In general, she hopes the return will herald a time that is \u201csofter and less focused on the academic\u201d, she says. \u201cParents are getting to know their children, in some cases, and that\u2019s that\u2019s a really positive thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Levinson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough but also a rare joy to have this time with my kids.

      "bodyText": "Term one at Australian schools did not so much end as unravel. Its final weeks were described by the New South Wales Teachers Federation as \u201cone of the most difficult school terms for the profession in living memory\u201d. Last weekend, the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, acknowledged arrangements will differ across states and territories in term two. \u201cThe nationally consistent approach is that, when it comes to parents who have to work, when it comes to vulnerable children, schools have to be open, and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d When the bulk of students return, Tehan and the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, are suggesting a staggered approach. \u201cWe could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out,\u201d Gavrielatos said last week. Until then, for many of Australia\u2019s four million students, school is at home \u2013 but it\u2019s not home-schooling per se. \u201cHome-schooling is when you make, or buy, your own curriculum,\u201d says Rebecca English, a professor at Queensland University of Technology\u2019s faculty of education. \u201c[These families] are simply facilitating their children\u2019s learning at home.\u201d Distance learning is the best parallel and that\u2019s been happening in rural and remote regions since Alice Springs\u2019 school of the air began via two-way radio in 1951. \u201cSchooling online isn\u2019t a revolution or a cause for concern, it\u2019s normal for thousands of children in Australia,\u201d says Philip Roberts, associate professor at the University of Canberra\u2019s faculty of education. The rapid and en masse switch to learning from home in March was not normal, however, and spotlighted pre-existing inequalities. \u201cThat includes students who don\u2019t have technology at home, don\u2019t have access to good broadband or don\u2019t have a supportive home environment,\u201d Prof Roberts says. Some states are trying to at least plug up the digital divide. The Victorian government is loaning around 6,000 devices to students in need, and providing SIM cards or dongles to others. NSW has a similar scheme, prioritising year 12 students. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies, including Telstra, Optus and budget providers, are offering free bonus data and waiving late payment fees. The main stress for families not under financial strain is that parents or carers were rapidly thrust into working from home too, often full-time. Matt Levinson lives in the Sydney suburb of Rozelle with his wife, Polly, a part-time physiotherapist at a hospital, and their children, Archer, nine, and Nina, 11. The couple took their children out of Rozelle public school three weeks ago when attendance in NSW fell to around 20%. Before Covid-19 struck, Levinson\u2019s job with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees was office-based but now he\u2019s at home. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m so grateful for that,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s been stressful. \u201cThose moments when you\u2019re trying to get through work and be available to workmates as well as support your kids or, like, solve a technical problem with signing in to Zoom or [Google] classroom or whatever,\u201d he says. Space is tight in the family\u2019s cottage. \u201cWe got a second-hand desk for my daughter but my son and I are both at the kitchen table working. The learning environment is very much patched together.\u201d Meanwhile Levinson\u2019s work is \u201cabsolutely peaking\u201d, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a worldwide crisis around preparing for the coronavirus response in refugee settlements.\u201d The Five Dock public school principal, Amanda Dawkins, understands parents\u2019 struggle. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people out there thinking \u2018if I\u2019m not productive, I\u2019m going to lose the job\u2019.\u201d Dawkins says the wellbeing of Five Dock\u2019s school community, teachers and students is paramount and that her Monday virtual assemblies are to \u201ctry to keep kids connected at a time of great disconnect\u201d. The impact of isolation is everywhere, she says. \u201cTeachers have rung up and can\u2019t get parents off the phone because it\u2019s another adult to talk to. People are not used to being with their kids all the time.\u201d Dawkins suspects some parents may have unrealistic expectations. \u201cIf they\u2019re expecting kids to be working six hours a day, good luck with that!\u201d she says. \u201cFor older children 30 to 45 minutes at a time is enough. For the little kids, it\u2019s 15 minutes. If they\u2019re getting wriggly or poking their sibling or there\u2019s a lot of sighing going on, it\u2019s time for a break. \u201cI\u2019ve told families, if kids come back with the skills and knowledge they had when they left us, I\u2019m happy. If they do fall behind we\u2019ll move them forward and then some.\u201d English says a healthy home learning environment is low pressure with gentle limits. \u201cInvolve your child in negotiating those limits,\u201d she says. \u201cSay \u2018I need to do X today and you need to do Y. How will we manage the day?\u2019. Kids with agency are more likely to come along for the ride.\u201d Morning is best. \u201cKids start to lose the plot a bit after lunch,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if something isn\u2019t working, or they\u2019re not understanding the work, let it go. You always have tomorrow. \u201cIf you\u2019re struggling with the volume of work being sent home \u2013 and some of what I\u2019m hearing from the private schools is just incredibly onerous \u2013 then tell the teachers. They are still your touchstone if you get stuck with anything.\u201d High school teachers have up to 100 students across multiple classes,so be patient, English says. \u201cThis is the first time teachers have had to do this. Everyone\u2019s finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other and with ourselves.\u201d Dr Samantha Thomas is the mother of a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who attend a public high school in Melbourne. Thomas had arranged time off work to transition her children but was pleasantly surprised at the school\u2019s implementation of remote learning. \u201cIt\u2019s clear a really significant amount of work was done to create structured lessons that engage the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so smooth that I\u2019ve still been able to get quite a bit of work done myself.\u201d Key to her 12-year-old\u2019s success is how he\u2019s connected with a friend. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working as a pair \u2013 he\u2019s taken it onto himself to do that. It\u2019s been interesting to hear them help and motivate each other with work or things they don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a really great skill for kids to learn as well.\u201d Both children workshopped a way to stay active by playing basketball in their lunch break. Again, says Thomas, it was their idea \u2013 not hers. \u201cAs a parent I probably underestimated their ability to problem solve and overcome challenges, including adapting to this new environment.\u201d With children Nina and Archer, Levinson and his wife are encouraging longer-term projects steered by the children. \u201cTheir set work doesn\u2019t fill whole days and they can\u2019t go and play with their friends. So we\u2019re doing some fun creative projects that last a few days or weeks. \u201cThey\u2019re working on some power points to convince us of a few things \u2026 we\u2019re setting up a vegetable garden. We\u2019ll keep some of the school structure over the holiday because all the other structure has kind of disappeared.\u201d Encouraging kids to pursue their own interests is a great idea for older kids too, English says. \u201cIt\u2019s agency and self-determination over their learning that they probably don\u2019t get at school. This time could potentially be a real boon. Everything is so siloed in school but I think we should be thinking more about integrating curriculum areas. We know from the research it\u2019s more interesting for students and teachers. Baking and gardening are examples, she says. \u201cWith baking a cake there\u2019s fractions and mass, mathematical concepts. Recipes are procedural texts and then you have elements of science, like, \u2018how does exposing this particular concoction to heat change it?\u2019. There is humanities and social sciences if you talk about your own baking experiences. You talk about intergenerationality and tell stories, which relates back to English.\u201d Dawkins says it will be interesting when all the students come back. \u201cThe kids at school have become quite close. It\u2019s really nice, they\u2019re playing together and working together.\u201d In general, she hopes the return will herald a time that is \u201csofter and less focused on the academic\u201d, she says. \u201cParents are getting to know their children, in some cases, and that\u2019s that\u2019s a really positive thing.\u201d Levinson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough but also a rare joy to have this time with my kids. I feel like I\u2019m seeing a totally different side of them, really understanding the way they work. When we go back to normality, assuming we do, this will be a time I will treasure.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI work hard, I do my best, but I still feel defeated by this unknown enemy. I just find myself crying at night thinking what will happen to me if this doesn\u2019t end soon.\u201d Alexis (not her real name) arrived in Melbourne from the Philippines in 2019. As one of more than 700,000 international students enrolled in Australian institutions last year, she saw an education in this country as, beyond the adventure of a new land to live in, a stepping stone to a brighter future. But the chaos and caprice of the Covid-19 pandemic has shattered those dreams: it has left her without an education to aspire to or employment to sustain her, and stranded in a foreign country without hope. \u2018We can\u2019t support you\u2019 \u201cI lost my job, the school doesn\u2019t want to support us or to discount or freeze our fees and the other bills are still coming in,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cAnd there is not even any moral support from the government because they think \u2026 \u2018we can\u2019t support you\u2019. We understand that their priority is Australian citizens but we feel we are alone in this fight.\u201d With her income cut off and her limited savings steadily eroding, Alexis says she cannot afford to buy food or other essentials, or to pay the bills still steadily mounting. She cannot afford a flight home and even if she could, there are no flights to the Philippines she can take. Alexis has a roof over her head, for now, but says without the Filipino diaspora\u2019s bayanihan \u2013 a Tagalog word that roughly translates as a spirit of communal solidarity \u2013 assisting her in Australia, she would be left destitute. \u201cI want to thank my Titos and Titas in each organisation in helping us with food and shelter. They gave us light in this darkness and hope and faith that this will eventually pass \u2026 we stay strong together.\u201d Her financial precarity keeps her awake at night, but Alexis says it is the repeated and public incidents of racism linked to Covid-19 that have shaken her faith in the country that once welcomed her. \u201cI feel so inhuman in the way some Australians treat an Asian international student like me. \u201cWhen I was on the train and I was wearing a mask for precaution, a man shouted at me telling me I\u2019m an idiot and stupid and because I\u2019m Asian I brought the virus into this country. He said he wanted to hit me. I felt so hopeless, I just bowed my head and got off the train.\u201d \u2018Had to draw the line somewhere\u2019 In constructing the massive $130bn stimulus package to save the nation\u2019s economy and as many jobs as possible, the government makes the argument that \u201cwe had to draw the line somewhere\u201d, and that that meant excluding people in Australia on temporary visas. \u201cThis is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come, and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce,\u201d the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued. \u201cAdd an extra million onto the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s an extra $18bn. We had to draw the line somewhere and I think the Australian people understand how generous, how significant this package is.\u201d Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge announced this month that international students would be able to access superannuation they had earned, as well as allowing them to work an additional 20 hours a week, if they still had employment. But the government\u2019s chief message during this pandemic to those who are not citizens of Australia has been, simply, to \u201cgo home\u201d. \u201cIf you are a visitor in this country, it is time \u2026 to make your way home,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said. \u201cOur focus and our priority is on supporting Australians and Australian residents with the economic supports that are available.\u201d For many, going home is not feasible \u2013 they have built lives and families and communities here. And for others it is simply not possible. There is no way home. Some countries have shut their borders to all entrants \u2013 citizens included \u2013 or there are no flights that can get them home, or transit countries such as Singapore have shut their borders to travellers. There are hundreds of thousands in Australia right now stranded with no safety net, and no prospect of government intervention. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, they were, in many cases, among Australia\u2019s most vulnerable people. They worked often in precarious employment in the gig economy, at risk of exploitation, under-payment and dangerous work practices. They find themselves now stranded in a foreign country, without the social capital of citizenship, or its legal protections. They are without the fallback of family, or the assistance of a lifetime of networks and friendships built up. In many cases, they are entirely alone. A sense of security Shubham Baid is in the second semester of a master\u2019s degree at the University of New South Wales. A councillor on the university\u2019s postgraduate council, he says his phone nows rings constantly \u2013 15 to 20 calls a day \u2013 from international students worried about their courses or capacity to survive and stay in Australia. Baid said students were concerned about being forced to pay full-rate student and course fees, when courses were now running online instead of being delivered in person, and worried they could get caught in breach of their visa conditions by travel restrictions. \u201cI can totally understand a country would first look after its citizens,\u201d Baid says, \u201cbut I think there needs to be some consideration, some provision for international students. International education brings an enormous amount, $39bn, into the Australian economy. And we are part of this community. We work and study here, we pay taxes, we live in the Australian community, but right now, we feel very disconnected, we feel isolated.\u201d Some initiatives, Baid argues, would cost the government little, if anything, such as automatic visa extensions for students whose studies have been interrupted. Baid says he and fellow councillors are preparing a survey of students, gauging their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIf the government cannot be sympathetic it becomes difficult to cope, the future becomes blurred for the students, and it is another great stress on top of the stress that everyone is already feeling during this crisis. We don\u2019t know what our futures will be. \u201cWe need to know we will be looked after in this country, that sense of security that everyone longs for, especially at a time like this.\u201d A moral imperative Reyvi Marinas is a member of Migrante Australia, a community and advocacy group for the Filipino diaspora, which has begun providing donated groceries, counselling and legal advice for students left destitute. Some students, he says, come to Migrante\u2019s doors distraught, having been harassed by debt collectors for student fees they simply can\u2019t pay. Marinas argues international students are a vital part of Australia, not just of its economy but the fabric of its communities as well, and says they feel \u201cabandoned\u201d by the government in the face of this crisis. There is a moral imperative to help those in the community left vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the crisis, he says. \u201cAustralia has encouraged these students to come to Australia \u2026 but in times of need, these students\u2019 contribution has been completely ignored and wilfully disregarded by this government. Many of these students have contributed immensely to the social, cultural and economic fabric of Australian society, many are taxpayers like the rest of Australian citizens and permanent residents in this country.\u201d He says many Filipino students face no choice but to find a way to survive in Australia.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of planes sitting idle on the tarmac. Thousands thrown out of work for years. Sky-high airfares. People who were around last time a big Australian airline collapsed say what happened then paints a grim picture of what could happen if the government allows the stricken Virgin Australia to go under. The collapse of Ansett in 2002 was \u201cshockingly devastating\u201d, the former opposition leader Bill Shorten says. He was the national secretary of the Australian Workers Union at the time and saw 500 of his members lose their jobs. \u201cPilots committed suicide, a lot went overseas.\u201d Families that relied on the airline suddenly had no income. \u201cAnsett had been a generational business \u2013 a lot of people had given two or three generations to Ansett,\u201d he said. Now, Shorten fears history will repeat itself, costing thousands of jobs and handing bigger rival Qantas a lucrative monopoly, unless the Morrison government abandons its opposition to bailing out Virgin Australia, which is fast burning cash after its fleet was grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic. Qantas is also burning money as its planes sit idle \u2013 but it had more money to begin with and can last longer. Estimates of how long Virgin Australia can last vary, but the airline is generally said to have less than six months of cash on hand while Qantas can wait out up to a year. Virgin Australia\u2019s situation is now so bad that the company is considering calling in administrators \u2013 one of a range of fast-dwindling options to try to keep operations viable until the day, however many months from now, that the situation allows airlines to fly again. On Thursday night, deputy prime minister and transport minister Michael McCormack announced the government would pay Virgin and Qantas to maintain a skeleton schedule of flights around Australia. But while the money allowed Virgin to keep a handful of planes in the air, and 200 staff in jobs, it only covers the cost of running the flights. This means it does nothing to staunch the outflow of precious cash needed to pay the cost of keeping the rest of Virgin Australia\u2019s 130 planes on the ground and making repayments on its $4.8bn in debt. Private equity players are reportedly circling the stricken airline, but sources say they are unlikely to buy in without government support. Without government money, administration could come within days or weeks. \u201cWe are clearly in crisis mode,\u201d Virgin Australia chief operating officer Stuart Aggs said on Friday at an industry roundtable organised by the union movement. \u201cWe are an airline and an industry under significant scrutiny, almost on an hourly basis.\u201d Virgin Australia has asked the Morrison government for a $1.4bn loan as part of an industry-wide support scheme. But a bailout for Virgin Australia is fiercely opposed by Qantas and its chief executive Alan Joyce, who has bitterly sledged the loss-making airline for what they claim is poor management over a decade. Qantas also says no taxpayer money should be used to support a largely foreign-owned company. The attacks have been so vigorous they are being investigated by the competition watchdog. And although McCormack says the government is committed to keeping two airlines in the air, the government has yet to come up with a plan to make sure it happens. The source of the sector\u2019s woes is different, but in broad strokes the industry\u2019s situation is similar to the one it confronted at the turn of the century. Back in the 1990s Australia had two major airlines, the privately owned Ansett and Qantas, which started the decade in government hands but was progressively privatised by the Hawke government. As part of the process of privatisation and deregulation of airlines, Qantas acquired TAA, flying domestic routes for the first time. By 2001, Ansett was on its knees and Qantas was looking to take it over. Allan Fels, who headed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission at the time, said the regulator was faced with a terrible choice. \u201cThe ACCC had to decide whether Qantas could take over Ansett or in the interests of competition let Ansett go under,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe ACCC agonised over the possibility of saving 15,000 jobs, but handing Qantas a monopoly.\u201d The terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 meant the ACCC never got to decide. \u201cWe were all set to make a decision but at the very last minute 9/11 occurred, the New York twin towers bombing, and Qantas decided it didn\u2019t want Ansett.\u201d The following year, Ansett collapsed. \u201cI\u2019ll just assert that fares went up,\u201d Fels said. At the time of the collapse, pilot George Kailis flew for Kendell, a regional airline that was a subsidiary of Ansett. Now, he\u2019s a Boeing 737 captain with Virgin Australia, and the vice president of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. He says that although he was lucky and went to work for regional airline Rex, many pilots found it tough to get a job after Ansett collapsed. He is fearful that pilots could again struggle to find work. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk into a job, you just don\u2019t end up back in the position you\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a person like me that\u2019s got 17 years flying a 737, who has been a captain for a number of those years, that won\u2019t mean anything to another airline unless I go overseas and take contract jobs that have time expiries to those contracts.\u201d A strict licensing regime that requires pilots to continuously keep their flying skills up-to-date is one of the reasons he thinks it would take between three and five years to start a new airline in Australia should Virgin collapse. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive capital expenditure, and then you have the training pipeline that\u2019s going to occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would take six months, on average, for every single pilot.\u201d Consumers would also suffer \u2013 Kailis said fares have fallen by more than a third since the early 2000s. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go back to pretty much a monopolistic system,\u201d he said. \u201cAirfares would go up.\u201d Shorten remembers the Ansett collapse well. \u201cI was 32 at the time, Osama Bin Laden had just hit the twin towers, and then Ansett \u2013 it was a terrible time,\u201d he said. He said the airline\u2019s pilots scattered. \u201cIt was just such a loss of skills, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes years to train, not just pilots, but avionics engineers\u2026 [and] skilled engine engineers. \u201cWe were a centre of maintenance excellence in Australia.

With foreign crews? \u201cThat\u2019s just not how it works. So what it\u2019s going to lead to is a monopoly and monopolies are not good for working people.\u201d Fels said there was also a potential problem if Virgin Australia\u2019s Chinese shareholders tried to take full control of the airline because it would face scrutiny from a Foreign Investment Review Board newly empowered to examine every offshore takeover bid. \u201cIn the past, Firb was not much more than a symbolic investigation of foreign takeovers, occasionally objecting, but now there\u2019s a long list of concerns including security concerns and the preservation of essential Australian firms,\u201d he said. Shorten dismissed the argument that Virgin Australia shouldn\u2019t be bailed out because it is foreign-owned as \u201ccrap\u201d. \u201cQantas is 40% foreign-owned with the shareholdings as it is. \u201cRex is majority foreign-owned and the government just handed out their National Party donors money no worries.\u201d (Rex donated $44,000 to the National Party and $21,000 to the ALP in 2018-19, the most recent year for which Electoral Commission data is available.) Shorten said: \u201cFor the party of competition to do nothing to maintain competition and allow a monopoly, the fantasy of a foreign airline \u2026 \u201cForeign ownership, well, you know, for me it\u2019s about where the jobs are.

We were already using the tiny Danish bricks as a tool to help with counting. Now, all of a sudden, they\u2019ve become an indispensable teaching aid.</p> <p>So you could say then that Nine\u2019s reality TV series Lego Masters has arrived back on our screens for its second season at just the right moment.

      "bodyText": "In the Victorian high country town of Bright, hope for a strong recovery after a summer of devastating bushfires was given human form in the shape of the US singer Katy Perry. The pop star performed to a crowd of thousands at Bright on 11 March, the first of a series of major events intended to bring tourists, and their wallets, back to fire-ravaged communities and put struggling businesses back on their feet. \u201cThe press coverage for Katy Perry we could not have purchased \u2013 it was just enormous,\u201d says the Alpine shire mayor, Peter Roper. \u201cIt was a really good, healing thing for the community to be able to take part in. I now know why she has got so many Instagram followers, she is really empathetic, a lovely person. \u201cAnd then, well, you know what happened next.\u201d Within hours of Perry\u2019s performance, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic.

      "bodyText": "The IMF this week released projections for the world economy over the next two years that were both optimistic and pessimistic. When the projections were released, I messaged a fellow economics journalist and suggested they were pretty optimistic \u2013 he replied that he hoped they would be correct because they were predicting it would only be the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Optimism comes in strange forms these days. The positive outlook of the IMF is that, while they predict Australia\u2019s GDP will fall by 6.7% this year (the worst fall since the Great Depression), they also predict it will rebound next year to rise by 6.1% (the best result since 1984 and second-strongest for 50 years). That assessment suggested the IMF was predicting a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. There is no real science to any of this, but economists and commentators like to talk about recessions in terms of the shapes of letters. \u201cV\u201d means basically an equally sharp fall and recovery, which is the most desired type (if you can desire a recession). A \u201cW\u201d shape is one where the quick recovery is hit with another slump and recovery. \u201cU\u201d shape means the economy stays weak for a couple years, and then recovers strongly. Finally there is the dreaded \u201cL\u201d shape, in which the economy stays weak for even longer \u2013 five to 10 years of barely enough growth to keep unemployment flat, but not enough to improve things all that much. So for now the IMF (which gets advice from Treasury to formulate its estimates) sees a \u201cV\u201d shaped recovery. And yet not all is good. While it expects the economy to grow almost as fast in 2021 as it did in 1984, unlike then, it expects the unemployment rate to rise \u2013 from 7.6% this year to 8.9% by the end of next year. This is where the IMF is both optimistic and pessimistic. There is a pretty solid relationship between GDP growth and unemployment (known as Okun\u2019s Law) whereby the faster GDP grows the more the unemployment rate falls. Over the past 50 years, we have needed the economy to grow by around 3.2% to keep the unemployment rate steady. In the past 20 years or so this has come down a bit, so now around 3% is good enough. As a general rule, for every 1% that the economy grows above or below 3%, the unemployment rate will fall or rise 0.5%pts. So, for example, given the current unemployment rate is 5.2%, if the economy was to grow by only 2% in a year, you would expect the unemployment rate to rise 0.5%pts to 5.7%. Using the past 50 years as a guide, if the economy was to shrink by 6.7% in a year, as the IMF predicts, then the unemployment rate would be expected to rise by around 4.5%pts \u2013 which would take us up to 9.7%. And yet the IMF predicts unemployment this year to rise only to 7.6%. That is optimistic and takes into account the government\u2019s jobkeeper policy, which will see some people who would normally be classified as unemployed notionally still working. But there the optimism ends. While the IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.1% in 2021 \u2013 which would normally mean the unemployment rate should fall by around 1.5%pts \u2013 it predicts the unemployment rate to rise another 1.3%pts to 8.9%. What this means is that while production might \u201csnap back\u201d (to use the prime minister\u2019s phrase) we are likely in for a much tougher recovery on the employment front. Mining production may again ramp up, but labour-heavy sectors like tourism, hospitality and retail will be much slower to return to where we were just three months ago. It means reducing government stimulus will also need to be done with care because while a \u201cV\u201d shape recession is hoped for, rushing the recovery and abruptly cutting stimulus can very easily see the \u201cL\u201d shape become a reality.

But with an estimated 6,000 people having already died in care homes from Covid-19 \u2013 a figure not included in Saturday\u2019s official tally \u2013 the 20,000 figure is likely already to have been exceeded.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">In an interview with The Observer</a> Nabarro said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon \u2013 and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. In addition hospital capacity for dealing with cases will have to be ensured.

It would also require richer nations doing more to support the health systems of the world\u2019s poorest countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think global health security is going to be on that small but critical list of topics like climate change that we can only solve in partnership with other countries,\u201d Hunt told The Observer.</p> \n<p>In a clear criticism of US President Donald Trump who announced last week he was putting on hold funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Hunt added: \u201cSurely the lesson of coronavirus is cure not kill\u2026It certainly does not mean cutting their funding (to the WHO).</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the big lessons from this will be that when it comes to health systems across the world, we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough China has rightly been criticised for covering up the virus in the early stages the situation would have been whole lot worse if this had started in Africa.

On Friday, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, warned that there was no evidence that antibody tests now being developed would show if a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming reinfected by the Covid-19 virus.</p> \n<p>On Saturday it emerged that doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\">shortages of protective full-length gowns</a> for weeks to come, as anger mounts over failures to stockpile them. Gowns were not included in a stockpile list prepared for a potential flu pandemic.</p> \n<p>After The Guardian revealed new guidance from Public Health England which instructs healthcare workers to re-use disposable equipment, the GMB, which represents NHS and ambulance staff, said support was \u201cdraining away\u201d from Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers which represents many trusts, told the Observer: \u201cWe are in a situation where we think this [issue] will last a couple of weeks, which probably does just take us to May.

      "bodyText": "Humanity will have to live with the threat of coronavirus \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d and adapt accordingly because there is no guarantee that a vaccine can be successfully developed, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the disease has warned. The stark message was delivered by David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organisation on Covid-19, as the number of UK hospital deaths from the virus passed 15,000. A further 888 people were reported on Saturday to have lost their lives \u2013 a figure described by communities secretary Robert Jenrick as \u201cextremely sobering\u201d \u2013 while the total number who have been infected increased by 5,525 to 114,217. The latest figures, which do not include deaths in care homes and in the community, put further pressure on the government amid continuing anger among NHS workers and unions over the lack personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital and care home staff on the front line. In late March the government\u2019s health advisers said that if UK deaths from Coronavirus could be kept below 20,000 by the end of the pandemic, it would be a \u201cgood result\u201d for country. But with an estimated 6,000 people having already died in care homes from Covid-19 \u2013 a figure not included in Saturday\u2019s official tally \u2013 the 20,000 figure is likely already to have been exceeded. In an interview with The Observer Nabarro said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon \u2013 and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat. \u201cThat means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. In addition hospital capacity for dealing with cases will have to be ensured. That is going to be the new normal for us all.\u201d The comments came as the former UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the only way forward was for nations to support a new global health system that would mean far more international cooperation between governments on health issues. It would also require richer nations doing more to support the health systems of the world\u2019s poorest countries. \u201cI think global health security is going to be on that small but critical list of topics like climate change that we can only solve in partnership with other countries,\u201d Hunt told The Observer. In a clear criticism of US President Donald Trump who announced last week he was putting on hold funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Hunt added: \u201cSurely the lesson of coronavirus is cure not kill\u2026It certainly does not mean cutting their funding (to the WHO). \u201cOne of the big lessons from this will be that when it comes to health systems across the world, we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. \u201cAlthough China has rightly been criticised for covering up the virus in the early stages the situation would have been whole lot worse if this had started in Africa. International cooperation and supporting health care systems of the poorest countries has to be a top priority in terms of the lessons we need to learn.\u201d Nabarro\u2019s message is the second grim warning to come from senior ranks of the WHO in the last three days. On Friday, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, warned that there was no evidence that antibody tests now being developed would show if a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming reinfected by the Covid-19 virus. On Saturday it emerged that doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, as anger mounts over failures to stockpile them. Gowns were not included in a stockpile list prepared for a potential flu pandemic. After The Guardian revealed new guidance from Public Health England which instructs healthcare workers to re-use disposable equipment, the GMB, which represents NHS and ambulance staff, said support was \u201cdraining away\u201d from Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers which represents many trusts, told the Observer: \u201cWe are in a situation where we think this [issue] will last a couple of weeks, which probably does just take us to May. There is a shortage of gowns which is affecting some trusts, but not all. Some have none, and are using the alternatives.\u201d The government will attempt to gain control of the mounting PPE concerns by appointing Paul Deighton, chief executive of the London Olympics organising committee, to lead efforts to produce equipment in Britain. Ministers also announced another \u00a31.6bn cash injection to local councils as they attempt to stem a spiralling crisis in social care that is pushing some care providers into the red. Some have been paying inflated prices for commercial protective equipment.",

Former paramedic Paul Goodwin, who earlier this month set up the Facebook group Covidiots UK for a few friends \u201cto highlight some of the unbelievable behaviour of people\u201d now has nearly 200 members. On the Mumsnet website, one user was considering naming and shaming her husband in the village Facebook group for \u201cgoing out at least once a day\u201d in his sports car. Police have also been accused of being overly keen. Last week, The chief constable of Northamptonshire police, Nick Adderley, backtracked after threatening that his officers would start to look in people\u2019s shopping trolleys and baskets for non-essential items if they continued to flout the rules. The policing approach is to engage with people, explain the rules, encourage them to go home and use enforcement as a last resort. So far more than 3,200 fines have been issued by police in England for alleged breaches. \u2022 The article was amended on 19 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said that the number of reports received daily by West Midlands police was as many as 2,000; that should have been 1,000. The force is the second largest in England and Wales, not the UK as originally stated.",

Not least to huge amounts of innocent people.\u201d Over on the website Mumsnet, one user was considering vilifying her husband in the village Facebook group for \u201cgoing out at least once a day in his twatty sportscar\u201d while another thread on the internet forum was dedicated to analysing \u201cwhy people are covidiots\u201d. Frustration is evidently running high. \u201cThe entitled think they are somehow special and justify their actions to themselves,\u201d wrote lubeybooby. Another poster, Oldhaggard, blamed \u201cgood ol\u2019 fashioned selfishness \u2026 We\u2019re used to our wants being addressed as needs most of the time, and I think people are struggling to see a difference between them.\u201d However, Stephen Reicher, a professor of psychology at St Andrews and leading expert on crowd psychology, was encouraged by the public response overall. \u201cLevels of compliance are remarkably high. Most people phoning [the police] think they are doing a moral duty. They\u2019re not necessarily evil snitches, they think they\u2019re doing a public good. \u201cWe should set positive norms about behaviour. Rather than starting from a presumption of an ill-will, one should start from the presumption that people are good: trust your neighbour and ask how you can help them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A day after Donald Trump encouraged Americans to protest against strict public health measures aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, rallies were held in state capitals in Maryland, Texas and Ohio, with more planned for next week in other states. Hundreds of people stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the Texas Capitol on Saturday, chanting \u201cFire Fauci!\u201d as part of a protest organized by the conspiracy theory site InfoWars. Anthony Fauci is the top public health expert on the White House coronavirus taskforce. In Maryland, protesters stayed inside their cars and honked their horns as they drove around the capital, Annapolis, to demand that Governor Larry Hogan \u201creopen Maryland\u201d. In Columbus, Ohio, hundreds of protesters gathered, some chanting \u201cWe are not sheep\u201d. The protests demanding governors reverse shutdown orders have been boosted by rightwing media outlets and by the president, who tweeted on Friday \u201cLiberate Minnesota!\u201d and \u201cLiberate Michigan!\u201d in the wake of a protest in Michigan that drew thousands of people. Widespread shutdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus have left many Americans unemployed, worried that their small businesses will not survive the next few months of the crisis, and afraid of deepening economic problems. But those actually taking to the streets to protest against public health measures represent a minority opinion, according to a recent poll. Two-thirds of Americans fear that state governments will lift restrictions on public activity too quickly, compared with only one third who worry they will not do so quickly enough, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of nearly 5,000 American adults. Republicans were evenly divided on the issue, with 51% saying they were concerned about restrictions being lifted too quickly, the poll found. In Texas, even the InfoWars contributor who organized the rally estimated that it had attracted, at most, a few hundred people.

Some participants flew American flags and many scrawled protest messages on their windows. \u201cWe are petitioning our governor, Larry Hogan, to immediately reopen our state\u2019s business, educational and religious institutions,\u201d the protest organizers wrote in an online letter, arguing that, while coronavirus was a serious public health concern, \u201cthe economic, social and educational disruption caused by shutdowns is guaranteed to cause significant, even greater, harm\u201d. One local resident who participated in the protest wrote that he wanted to show up so the governor \u201chears both sides\u201d of the debate over how long to keep shutdown measures in place, and said he had seen hundreds of other cars participating. \u201cRight now it seems to be all shutdown, without consideration for those who are hurt by it.

In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon.</p> <p>\u201cRegular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon\u2019s global workforce to nearly 1 million.</p> <p>Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: \u201cAmazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,\u201d he added. \u201cOf all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.\u201d</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended to correct the date for Amazon\u2019s reporting of its quarterly earnings. The earnings report is scheduled for 30 April. </p>",

The man who started Amazon in his garage in 1994 and still owns 11% of the company\u2019s shares saw his paper fortune swell by $13bn this week alone to $145bn. He is now worth $40bn more than the second-richest person, Bill Gates, and holds almost double the wealth of third-placed Warren Buffett. Bezos, who has donated $100m (\u00a380m) to the food bank charity Feeding America, has told staff he is concentrating on developing testing that should help Amazon staff keep working. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon. \u201cRegular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,\u201d he said. Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon\u2019s global workforce to nearly 1 million. Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: \u201cAmazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from. \u201cAmazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,\u201d he added. \u201cOf all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended to correct the date for Amazon\u2019s reporting of its quarterly earnings. The earnings report is scheduled for 30 April.",

      "body": "<p>Paterson Riley was not thinking decades ahead or even months ahead when in 1972 he opened <a href=\"https://www.thegreatfroglondon.com/\" title=\"\">the Great Frog</a>, a small alternative jewellers off London\u2019s Carnaby Street. All the New Zealander wanted to do was make a quick buck, which is funny because hand-making jewellery isn\u2019t the easiest route to that, particularly when you\u2019re not a jeweller. But having acquired the shop in some hazy 1970s deal that was never entirely clear to the rest of his family, and realising that jewellery was what sold best there, jewellery is what he sold. \u201cAnd if a customer asked, \u2018Can you make me one like this?\u2019 he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d laughs his son, Reino Lehtonen-Riley, today. \u201cHe taught himself to make jewellery, because he needed the money. He never turned down a sale.\u201d</p> <p>Almost half a century later and Reino is running an international jewellery brand, best known for its handmade gothic designs in sterling silver or gold \u2013 grinning skull rings with hulking gemstones, ace of spades ear studs and dagger pendants. The Great Frog has been worn by Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lemmy\" title=\"\">Lemmy</a> and any number of heavy metal royalty you can think of, not to mention the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, Alexa Chung and Jared Leto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9be8733874b8af7f0806ec35c766788602b0b202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9be8733874b8af7f0806ec35c766788602b0b202/0_202_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord of the rings: Lemmy wearing a selection of silver jewellery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord of the rings: Lemmy wearing a selection of silver jewellery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Petersen/Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the 70s and 80s, the shops \u2013 there was also one in Harrow and both were run by Paterson and his wife, Carol Lehtonen-Riley \u2013 came to the attention of bikers, goths, rockers, musicians and any one who harboured dreams of wearing a leather jacket. Now there are Great Frog stores in Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans and Shoreditch, as well as a concession in Dover Street Market.</p> <p>While there are homages to the Great Frog\u2019s signature styles everywhere today \u2013 under designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/19/guccis-creative-director-says-fashion-is-not-only-about-garments\" title=\"\">Alessandro Michele</a>, Gucci\u2019s jewellery collection shares some of the same gothic sensibilities \u2013 back in the 1970s, no one else was making jewellery like this. It quickly became the ultimate accessory for the counter-culture. \u201cYou\u2019d see a certain type of person with tattoos and long hair walking down the road and you knew where they were going,\u201d says Reino. Family life was alternative and haphazard, too. \u201cThere were always a lot of adults around. They showed me how to fix bikes and forage for mushrooms \u2013 and my dad showed me how to make jewellery. It was normal to me, but you look back and realise it was like growing up in a Wes Anderson film \u2013 turning up at school aged 10 wearing cowboy boots and a fringed leather jacket,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting picked up by a Hells Angels biker on his chopper or by a car that\u2019s painted matt black to look like a hearse. These things were massively embarrassing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8cb20acfe590dfc872b4907e60ced34b03047e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cb20acfe590dfc872b4907e60ced34b03047e03/230_283_1511_1472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"motorhead-ace-of-spades-ring-angled\" width=\"1000\" height=\"974\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do all the carving and design in the same way it\u2019s been done since Roman times\u2019: Reino Lehtonen-Riley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was then only a matter of time then before the teenage Reino developed a taste for the exact opposite of his parents\u2019 lifestyle and look. He took refuge in a short back and sides and a suburban preppie uniform of lilac polo shirts and chinos. He chose to study engineering at college. \u201cMy dad would look at me and say, \u2018You\u2019re no son of mine.\u2019\u201d Reino ended up in Australia working for Giorgio Armani \u2013 which is about as far from heavy metal jewellery as you can get in fashion. But it gave him a chance to learn more about retail on an entirely different scale to the Great Frog, and that gave him a useful perspective when Paterson called him back to England to help him close down the failing shop.</p> <p>Reino looked at the debts and realised they weren\u2019t that big. \u201cI knew it could be salvaged if we cut everything right back,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the business and how to make jewellery, and I looked at the heritage \u2013 I\u2019d find these bags of press cuttings and hear my dad\u2019s stories \u2013 and I knew we had this amazing history. So we honed it down to the good stuff.\u201d Which makes it sound easy, but many years of inter-generational tension were to follow. \u201cEvery inch was hard. It was a huge personal battle between me and my dad. He thought I was losing the soul of the business. He was like: \u2018People want skulls! More bats! More fangs! More blood!\u2019 He\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ozzyosbourne\" title=\"\">Ozzy Osbourne.

Each new ring design starts with him at the workshop bench with a piece of wax. \u201cI do all the carving and design in the same way it\u2019s been done since Roman times \u2013 just three hand tools, scratching away. I make a piece and then we make a mould from that.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of the collection is made in silver (smaller rings start at around \u00a3110) with more expensive options in 9ct gold and a small amount of bespoke \u2013 including a \u00a340,000 ring made for Jay-Z in collaboration with artist <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/wes-lang-artist-interview\" title=\"\">Wes Lang</a> in 18ct gold, inlaid with diamonds. The collections have gone through an evolution and the new pieces Reino has introduced, such as his \u201cMum\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d signet rings, are hugely popular. \u201cI thought people were going to sneer at them, but they love them. I loved becoming a dad myself. A lot of the stuff I do is autobiographical.\u201d (Reino has a three-year-old and Danielle has another child on the way). The brand recently branched out into wedding and engagement rings. \u201cPeople who get married want to buy a ring that\u2019s part of their lifestyle. Maybe Tiffany doesn\u2019t reflect that for some people and I like the fact that those people can come to us, subverting the traditions and making things beautiful in their own right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a62075eb281e9d046ddba4cca68ff82596d97c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a62075eb281e9d046ddba4cca68ff82596d97c3/0_43_1026_616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The original Carnaby Street Great Frog store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seventies hit: the original Carnaby Street store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we speak, London is well into coronavirus lockdown and Reino is anxious about his company. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 40 employees and we are like family,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with rent in Japan and Los Angeles, and I don\u2019t know how long we can go on for, but the online customers have been brilliant.

      "bodyText": "Paterson Riley was not thinking decades ahead or even months ahead when in 1972 he opened the Great Frog, a small alternative jewellers off London\u2019s Carnaby Street. All the New Zealander wanted to do was make a quick buck, which is funny because hand-making jewellery isn\u2019t the easiest route to that, particularly when you\u2019re not a jeweller. But having acquired the shop in some hazy 1970s deal that was never entirely clear to the rest of his family, and realising that jewellery was what sold best there, jewellery is what he sold. \u201cAnd if a customer asked, \u2018Can you make me one like this?\u2019 he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d laughs his son, Reino Lehtonen-Riley, today. \u201cHe taught himself to make jewellery, because he needed the money. He never turned down a sale.\u201d Almost half a century later and Reino is running an international jewellery brand, best known for its handmade gothic designs in sterling silver or gold \u2013 grinning skull rings with hulking gemstones, ace of spades ear studs and dagger pendants. The Great Frog has been worn by Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s Lemmy and any number of heavy metal royalty you can think of, not to mention the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, Alexa Chung and Jared Leto. Throughout the 70s and 80s, the shops \u2013 there was also one in Harrow and both were run by Paterson and his wife, Carol Lehtonen-Riley \u2013 came to the attention of bikers, goths, rockers, musicians and any one who harboured dreams of wearing a leather jacket. Now there are Great Frog stores in Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans and Shoreditch, as well as a concession in Dover Street Market. While there are homages to the Great Frog\u2019s signature styles everywhere today \u2013 under designer Alessandro Michele, Gucci\u2019s jewellery collection shares some of the same gothic sensibilities \u2013 back in the 1970s, no one else was making jewellery like this. It quickly became the ultimate accessory for the counter-culture. \u201cYou\u2019d see a certain type of person with tattoos and long hair walking down the road and you knew where they were going,\u201d says Reino. Family life was alternative and haphazard, too. \u201cThere were always a lot of adults around. They showed me how to fix bikes and forage for mushrooms \u2013 and my dad showed me how to make jewellery. It was normal to me, but you look back and realise it was like growing up in a Wes Anderson film \u2013 turning up at school aged 10 wearing cowboy boots and a fringed leather jacket,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting picked up by a Hells Angels biker on his chopper or by a car that\u2019s painted matt black to look like a hearse. These things were massively embarrassing.\u201d It was then only a matter of time then before the teenage Reino developed a taste for the exact opposite of his parents\u2019 lifestyle and look. He took refuge in a short back and sides and a suburban preppie uniform of lilac polo shirts and chinos. He chose to study engineering at college. \u201cMy dad would look at me and say, \u2018You\u2019re no son of mine.\u2019\u201d Reino ended up in Australia working for Giorgio Armani \u2013 which is about as far from heavy metal jewellery as you can get in fashion. But it gave him a chance to learn more about retail on an entirely different scale to the Great Frog, and that gave him a useful perspective when Paterson called him back to England to help him close down the failing shop. Reino looked at the debts and realised they weren\u2019t that big. \u201cI knew it could be salvaged if we cut everything right back,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the business and how to make jewellery, and I looked at the heritage \u2013 I\u2019d find these bags of press cuttings and hear my dad\u2019s stories \u2013 and I knew we had this amazing history. So we honed it down to the good stuff.\u201d Which makes it sound easy, but many years of inter-generational tension were to follow. \u201cEvery inch was hard. It was a huge personal battle between me and my dad. He thought I was losing the soul of the business. He was like: \u2018People want skulls! More bats! More fangs! More blood!\u2019 He\u2019s like Ozzy Osbourne. Imagine talking to Ozzy about your business!\u201d Reino officially took over the Great Frog in 2002 and now with his wife, Danielle, handles all aspects of the brand, from the creative to the office. Each new ring design starts with him at the workshop bench with a piece of wax. \u201cI do all the carving and design in the same way it\u2019s been done since Roman times \u2013 just three hand tools, scratching away. I make a piece and then we make a mould from that.\u201d The majority of the collection is made in silver (smaller rings start at around \u00a3110) with more expensive options in 9ct gold and a small amount of bespoke \u2013 including a \u00a340,000 ring made for Jay-Z in collaboration with artist Wes Lang in 18ct gold, inlaid with diamonds. The collections have gone through an evolution and the new pieces Reino has introduced, such as his \u201cMum\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d signet rings, are hugely popular. \u201cI thought people were going to sneer at them, but they love them. I loved becoming a dad myself. A lot of the stuff I do is autobiographical.\u201d (Reino has a three-year-old and Danielle has another child on the way). The brand recently branched out into wedding and engagement rings. \u201cPeople who get married want to buy a ring that\u2019s part of their lifestyle. Maybe Tiffany doesn\u2019t reflect that for some people and I like the fact that those people can come to us, subverting the traditions and making things beautiful in their own right.\u201d When we speak, London is well into coronavirus lockdown and Reino is anxious about his company. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 40 employees and we are like family,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with rent in Japan and Los Angeles, and I don\u2019t know how long we can go on for, but the online customers have been brilliant. I\u2019ve actually said to some: \u2018Are you sure you want to be spending money on this at the moment?\u2019 But they\u2019ve all said yes. I\u2019ve wrangled with what I do for a long time, but then jewellery just means so much to people. It means so much to me.\u201d Small but perfectly formed Whether inspired by nature or ethically sourced, here are five independent jewellers to wear with pride.

By Thursday, DeSantis put the number of claims paid at around 33,000, with the state reporting a backlog of more than 800,000.</p> <p>But the state\u2019s secrecy has led to increasing criticism from Democrats and transparency advocates, who say DeSantis is keeping critical information under wraps at a time when people need to know more about what\u2019s happening in order to make informed decisions about their lives and livelihoods.</p> <p>\u201cOpenness, helpfulness, honesty: that\u2019s what we want from our government in a crisis,\u201d Marsh said Thursday in an interview.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Florida governor also said his task force charged with working on a plan to re-open the economy amid the pandemic will start meeting \u201ctelephonically\u201d on Monday and will issue short-term recommendations to him before the end of the week.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re meeting every day this coming week and I was some recommendations by the end of the week,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cSo, hey, if they solve the world in three days, then they don\u2019t have to meet [the rest of the week].\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T21:06:53.765Z\">at 10.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b61aa8f08bade1f295c74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T20:26:08.821Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Florida governor Ron DeSantis is set to make a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d regarding Covid-19 at a news conference at 4:30pm, according to a release from his office.</p> <p>The announcement will come as the governor has made the push for the re-opening of beaches along the state\u2019s 1,350 miles of shoreline if it can be done safely, a decision that has been in the hands of local governments. </p> <p>DeSantis, whose victory in a hard-fought 2018 election that drew national attention was tipped largely by Trump\u2019s endorsement and cash from the president\u2019s allies, issued a \u201csafer at home\u201d order on 1 April, but he was explicit in classifying walking, running and swimming as essential activities.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b58948f08bade1f295c5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T19:45:53.139Z\">8.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Michigan prisoner who declined to be paroled in May after decades behind bars has died from Covid-19 complications, the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/04/18/michigan-prisons-coronavirus-infections-deaths-william-garrison/5156073002/\">Detroit Free Press reports</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>William Garrison was due to come home from prison in early May. After nearly 44 years incarcerated, he would be free from a life sentence handed to him as a juvenile.</p> <p>His sister Yolanda Peterson had prepared a room for him to stay in her Harper Woods home and planned for his parole agent to come see the place. She was brainstorming how, given the coronavirus pandemic, she might help her brother celebrate his 61st birthday at the end of May. </p> <p>Plans for the future fell apart Monday, when Peterson got word that her brother had died unexpectedly in prison. </p> <p>Garrison\u2019s bunkmate found him gasping for air that evening in their two-man cell at Macomb Correctional Facility, according to Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz. Staff performed CPR. Garrison was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Gautz said. </p> <p>A postmortem test confirmed that he was positive for Covid-19. He hadn\u2019t complained to his family or prison staff of coronavirus symptoms.</p> <p>Peterson said it hurts for her brother to die now after \u201csurviving 44 years in prison,\u201d when his freedom was weeks away. \u201cMy brother shouldn\u2019t have died in there like that,\u201d she said Friday evening.</p> <p>Peterson believes that prison staff should have done more to prevent her brother from contracting the virus. She said men in prison have told her that her brother\u2019s cellmate was ill several days before Garrison died.</p> <p>The Department of Corrections disputed that account. Gautz said health care staff went cell-to-cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison\u2019s bunkmate denied having symptoms of Covid-19, aside from a cough. The man later tested negative for the coronavirus when assessed again after Garrison\u2019s death, Gautz said. </p> <p>Garrison is one of 17 state prisoners who\u2019ve died of Covid-19 as of Friday. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b53548f08b7689b030fcd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T19:28:59.754Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe/0_108_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with <strong>George W.

The New York governor said the net change in total hospitalizations are down over the last three days. More worryingly, there were 2,000 new hospitalizations yesterday. Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies. Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with George W. Bush over tax policy and then produced a book critical of the administration, died Saturday. He was 84. Amy Klobuchar on US response: \u2018There was never a national strategy\u2019. The former presidential candidate and sitting Minnesota senator, whose husband caught coronavirus, accused the Trump administration of losing time by not having a national strategy to combat the coronavirus. Fact check: \u2018More guns sold than any time in history\u2019 Trump said that Democrats in Virginia were talking about \u201ctaking your guns away\u201d at the same time that there were \u201cmore guns sold that I think at any time in history\u201d. Trump is correct that background checks for gun sales and other transactions reached historic highs in early March, in the early weeks of the pandemic, although that\u2019s only according to FBI data going back to 1998. A New York Times analysis of federal data, which tries to separate out background checks for gun sales alone from checks conducted for other reasons, like issuing permits to carry a concealed weapon, estimated that there were slightly fewer guns sold in March 2020 than in January 2013, as President Obama vowed to pass new gun control measures after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December. There\u2019s more on the claim that Virginia Democrats want to take guns away\u201d in a previous post. You can read more about the record-breaking gun background check numbers here: Fact check: guns in Virginia Asked about his tweets encouraging protests against shutdown measures imposed by Democratic governors, Trump said some states were being \u201cunreasonable\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re using this \u2013 they\u2019re trying to take your guns away in Virginia. And if people in Virginia aren\u2019t careful, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cThey want to violate your Second Amendment.\u201d The facts: After years of resistance to gun control by Republican lawmakers, Virginia citizens elected a Democratic-controlled state government in November. Virginia\u2019s Democrats moved swiftly to pass sweeping new gun control laws, including a requirement to conduct background checks before all gun sales, a one-gun-a-month purchase limit, and the creation of an extreme risk protection order, which creates a way to petition a court to temporarily remove a person\u2019s guns if they are at imminent risk of hurting themselves or someone else. The gun control measures Democrats have passed in Virginia have already been passed in many other states across the country, and have not been found to violate the Second Amendment. By global standards, the restrictions are quite modest. Some, like the creation of extreme risk protection orders, have even found bipartisan support in the past, including from Trump himself. But Democrats\u2019 push for gun control provoked huge grassroots protests by gun rights activists in Virginia, culminating in a demonstration that brought an estimated 22,000 people, many of them armed, to Virginia\u2019s capital in January. Trump cheered on the protesters at the time. The protests were fueled in part by a very real, new push for gun control in a state that had previously been seen as a gun rights haven. But they were also fueled by lies, conspiracies and misinformation. Virginia\u2019s Democrats quickly backed away from their most controversial policy proposal, a draft of an assault weapon ban that was originally written to include a ban on the possession of military-style weapons. But gun rights activists, who saw the draft legislation as proof that Virginia Democrats were interested in literally going door-to-door to confiscate Virginians\u2019 AR-15 rifles, were not persuaded by the reversal, and have continued to raise fears about gun confiscation. The fight over gun control in Virginia predates the coronavirus pandemic, and was well on its way immediately after Democrats won the election in November. Fact check: HIV funding The president just said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done for Aids in Africa is unbelievable. We\u2019ve spent $6bn a year. That\u2019s been going on for a long time. Nobody knows that. You\u2019ve never heard that. I\u2019ve never heard that.\u201d We must say here that a lot of people know that. Probably the most relevant thing there is Trump saying that he has never heard that. The spending quote for Africa is part of the annual $6.8bn in US funds for global HIV and Aids relief. What Donald Trump failed to say is that while he is keen to spend more on beating HIV and Aids in the US, he has proposed cuts in US funding funding for Aids programs in Africa. Here are extracts from this report in the Washington Blade from February, 2020: With a declared goal of beating HIV/AIDS in the United States by 2030, President Trump this week in his $4.8 trillion budget request for fiscal year 2021 proposed major increases in HIV/AIDS funds, but global programs and social services used by low-income people with the disease face steep cuts.... But despite $716 million proposed to beat HIV in a PrEP-centric \u201cEnding the HIV Epidemic\u201d initiative, the budget seeks to cut Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS, or HOPWA, by $80 million, halve funding for PEPFAR and reduce the U.S. commitment to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculous &amp; Malaria.... For the Bush-era President\u2019s Emergency Plan AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which provides HIV treatment drugs to developing countries, primarily in Africa, Trump seeks $3.2 billion, which is $1.17 billion less than the money Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2020 funding levels. The proposed reduction is even steeper than the cut proposed by Trump in the previous budget request by $200 million. For the Global Fund, Trump proposed to contribute $1 for every $3 donated to the partnership, which is a reduction from an earlier U.S. commitment to donate $1 for every $2. Trump has abruptly ended the news conference after just over an hour, taking fewer questions than he normally does. With so much time devoted toward gun control in Virginia and his views on the press and projecting his vision of the country if Joe Biden wins November\u2019s election \u2013 and so little on the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 today\u2019s briefing, which you can watch here in full, very quickly took on the feel of a campaign rally. Trump is asked about a tweet he shared that questioned \u201cwhether authorities will \u201cenforce the social distancing orders for mosques during Ramadan (April 23-May23) like they did churches during Easter\u201d. Trump said that he just had a call with imams, ministers, and rabbis, and that \u201cI am somebody who believes in faith and it matters not what your faith is.\u201d But other people were biased, he said, and, in particular, biased against Christians. \u201cOur politicians try to treat different faiths very differently. The Christian faith is treated much differently than it was and I think it\u2019s treated very unfairly.\u201d About 70% of Americans describe themselves as Christian, according to a Pew survey of America\u2019s religious landscape, and 25% as Evangelical Christian. Only 0.9% describe themselves as Muslim. \u201cWe\u2019re spending mostly in Africa, six billion dollars a year,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThat\u2019s on Aids. What we\u2019ve done for Aids in Africa is unbelievable. We\u2019ve spent $6bn a year. That\u2019s been going on for a long time. Nobody knows that. You\u2019ve never heard that. I\u2019ve never heard that. Millions of people are living right now and living very comfortably because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague. That was a plague. But we spend $6bn a year and from what I hear it\u2019s very well spent, done by professionals including this great professional (Dr Birx).\u201d He continues: \u201cThe World Health Organization, we\u2019re just finding more and more problems. We spend this money really well. There are other ways we can spend the $500m. We can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped in a much greater way.\u201d Trump continues his broadside against the media, taking dead aim at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for a recent story which included a report that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has cried during meetings with administration staff on at least two occasions. \u201cI even read a story where Mark Meadows, who\u2019s a tough guy, he was crying. This is Maggie Haberman. You know, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia but she was wrong on Russia. So was everyone else. They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes. In fact it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side. The crime was not committed by this side, it was committed by the other side. A bunch of bad people.\u201d He continued: \u201cSo Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize. She\u2019s a third-rate reporter. New York Times. And we put her name up here last week. People thought it was a commercial, it wasn\u2019t a commercial. It was like a commerical but it wasn\u2019t a commercial. It was just clips. And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying. It\u2019s OK if he did ... but he\u2019s not a cryer. It was a nasty story in so many ways. It was fake news. And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter. I haven\u2019t spoken with her for a long time.\u201d Donald Trump is complaining about mainstream media outlets using anonymous sources. Fact check: Top level publications such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, etc, use on the record sources wherever possible in their reporting. But occasionally, the only way a story can be fully reported is to use sources who, the journalists agree, cannot be named because they were not authorized to talk, are afraid of retribution or being in danger, or or some other carefully considered reasons. Normally, the reporter will have verifiable information about the source and what they are telling the outlet, and the use of an unnamed source, and the reason they are remaining anonymous, will have to be authorized by senior editor(s). Fact check: US economy At a Saturday briefing, Trump once again said the US has the greatest economy in the world. It is true that the US is the richest country in the world and that \u2013 before the pandemic - Trump had presided over a record breaking 113 straight months of job growth and all time highs on the stock markets. But there were big problems with the US economy before Covid-19 hit. Stock market gains benefit mainly the wealthy. The richest 1% of Americans own more than half the value of equities owned by US households, according to Goldman Sachs. And too many of the new jobs created under Trump were low wage. Even billionaires were worrying about growing income inequality. Minorities, who earn less on average, failed to make much ground in the boom years and are now the first, and the hardest hit, in the downturn. Read more, from the Guardian\u2019s Broken Capitalism series: \u201cIt could have been stopped in China before it started and the whole world is suffering because of it,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Better than China, better than any country in the world, better than any country has ever had. We had the highest stock market in history by far \u2013 and I\u2019m honored by the fact has started to up very substantially. That\u2019s because the market is smart.\u201d Donald Trump is talking about national resources for tackling the coronavirus. Here are a couple of fact checks. And \u201cThe hardest thing of all by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators,\u201d Trump says. \u201cNow we\u2019re the king of ventilators. We have ventilators and we\u2019re going to be helping other countries very soon.\u201d He continues: \u201cUnfortunately some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing \u2013 because I inherited broken junk. Just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none and the hospitals were empty. For the most part the hospitals didn\u2019t have ventilators. We had take care of the whole country ... and now the rest of the world is coming to us asking if we can help with ventilators because they\u2019re very complicated, very expensive. They\u2019re very hard to build. And we have them coming in by the thousand.\u201d Fact check: death rates While the coronavirus death rates in the US, both in comparison to the number of confirmed cases and in comparison to the population, are relatively good they are not the best in the world. Research by the US\u2019s Johns Hopkins University showed that as of April 13, the death rate in the US was 4% of cases and 6.73 deaths per 100,000 population. That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. The death rate in China has been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population, but there are ongoing questions about China\u2019s reported death toll. Trump opens his daily coronavirus briefing on an offensive tack, accusing the media of failing to tout statistics that prove the US is winning the battle against the coronavirus better than any other nation. \u201cThe United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country with the possible exception of Germany,\u201d Trump says. \u201cOn a per-capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of western Europe with the lone exception of possibly Germany. This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France. Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States. But you don\u2019t hear that. You hear we have more death, but we\u2019re a much bigger country than any of those countries by far. \u201cSo when the fake news gets out there, they start talking about the United States has No 1. But we\u2019re not No 1, China is No 1. Just so you understand. China is No 1 by a lot. It\u2019s not even close. They\u2019re way ahead of us in terms of death. It\u2019s not even close. You know it. I know it. They know it. But you don\u2019t want to report it. Why? You\u2019ll have to explain that. Someday I\u2019ll explain it.\u201d Florida governor Ron DeSantis has announced that all K-12 schools in Florida will continue with distance learning for the rest of the school year at a news conference on Saturday in Tallahassee. Students across the state have been learning from home for more than month with the original order for online classes set to end on 15 April before it was extended to 1 May. Then in a big reversal, DeSantis said he will release the names the nursing homes and assisted living facilities where residents and staff have tested positive for Covid-19 in the interest of public health. The decision comes at a time when multiple media organizations have criticized DeSantis\u2019s administration for its lack of transparency, even threatening to sue for the information. As the Miami Herald wrote this week: In recent weeks, Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration has refused to name the nursing homes experiencing coronavirus outbreaks, even as the number of cases in long-term care facilities has passed 1,300. The Department of Corrections had until Wednesday declined to acknowledge two inmate COVID-19 deaths at a privately run prison. And the Department of Health has been unwilling to disclose the extent of an undefined backlog of unresolved coronavirus tests at private labs. In some cases, the lack of detail has appeared unintentional: DeSantis said Wednesday that he, himself, had been unable to get information about how many people have received unemployment checks from the Department of Economic Opportunity. By Thursday, DeSantis put the number of claims paid at around 33,000, with the state reporting a backlog of more than 800,000. But the state\u2019s secrecy has led to increasing criticism from Democrats and transparency advocates, who say DeSantis is keeping critical information under wraps at a time when people need to know more about what\u2019s happening in order to make informed decisions about their lives and livelihoods. \u201cOpenness, helpfulness, honesty: that\u2019s what we want from our government in a crisis,\u201d Marsh said Thursday in an interview. The Florida governor also said his task force charged with working on a plan to re-open the economy amid the pandemic will start meeting \u201ctelephonically\u201d on Monday and will issue short-term recommendations to him before the end of the week. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting every day this coming week and I was some recommendations by the end of the week,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cSo, hey, if they solve the world in three days, then they don\u2019t have to meet [the rest of the week].\u201d Florida governor Ron DeSantis is set to make a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d regarding Covid-19 at a news conference at 4:30pm, according to a release from his office. The announcement will come as the governor has made the push for the re-opening of beaches along the state\u2019s 1,350 miles of shoreline if it can be done safely, a decision that has been in the hands of local governments. DeSantis, whose victory in a hard-fought 2018 election that drew national attention was tipped largely by Trump\u2019s endorsement and cash from the president\u2019s allies, issued a \u201csafer at home\u201d order on 1 April, but he was explicit in classifying walking, running and swimming as essential activities. A Michigan prisoner who declined to be paroled in May after decades behind bars has died from Covid-19 complications, the Detroit Free Press reports. William Garrison was due to come home from prison in early May. After nearly 44 years incarcerated, he would be free from a life sentence handed to him as a juvenile. His sister Yolanda Peterson had prepared a room for him to stay in her Harper Woods home and planned for his parole agent to come see the place. She was brainstorming how, given the coronavirus pandemic, she might help her brother celebrate his 61st birthday at the end of May. Plans for the future fell apart Monday, when Peterson got word that her brother had died unexpectedly in prison. Garrison\u2019s bunkmate found him gasping for air that evening in their two-man cell at Macomb Correctional Facility, according to Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz. Staff performed CPR. Garrison was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Gautz said. A postmortem test confirmed that he was positive for Covid-19. He hadn\u2019t complained to his family or prison staff of coronavirus symptoms. Peterson said it hurts for her brother to die now after \u201csurviving 44 years in prison,\u201d when his freedom was weeks away. \u201cMy brother shouldn\u2019t have died in there like that,\u201d she said Friday evening. Peterson believes that prison staff should have done more to prevent her brother from contracting the virus. She said men in prison have told her that her brother\u2019s cellmate was ill several days before Garrison died. The Department of Corrections disputed that account. Gautz said health care staff went cell-to-cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison\u2019s bunkmate denied having symptoms of Covid-19, aside from a cough. The man later tested negative for the coronavirus when assessed again after Garrison\u2019s death, Gautz said. Garrison is one of 17 state prisoners who\u2019ve died of Covid-19 as of Friday. Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with George W. Bush over tax policy and then produced a book critical of the administration, died Saturday. He was 84. O\u2019Neill\u2019s son, Paul O\u2019Neill Jr. confirmed that his father died at his home in Pittsburgh after battling lung cancer for the last couple of years, The Associated Press writes. A former head of aluminum giant Alcoa, O\u2019Neill served as treasury secretary from 2001 to late 2002. He was forced to resign after he objected to a second round of tax cuts because of their impact on deficits. O\u2019Neill\u2019s blunt speaking style more than once got him in trouble as Treasury secretary. He sent the dollar into a tailspin briefly in his early days at Treasury when his comments about foreign exchange rates surprised markets. In the spring of 2001, O\u2019Neill jolted markets again when during Wall Street\u2019s worst week in 11 years, he blandly declared \u201cmarkets go up and markets go down.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said Saturday on Twitter: \u201cSaddened to hear of the passing of the former 72nd Treasury Secretary, Paul O\u2019Neill. He served (at)USTreasury and America with distinction during challenging times. My condolences to his family.\u201d After leaving the administration, O\u2019Neill worked with author Ron Suskind on an explosive book covering his two years in the administration. O\u2019Neill contended that the administration began planning the overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein right after Bush took office, eight months before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. O\u2019Neill depicted Bush as a disengaged president who didn\u2019t encourage debate either at Cabinet meetings or in one-on-one discussions with Cabinet members. He said the lack of discussion in Cabinet meetings gave him the feeling that Bush \u201cwas like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.\u201d He said major decisions were often made by Bush\u2019s political team and Vice President Dick Cheney. New Jersey governor battles misinformation New Jersey, which has the second-most confirmed coronavirus cases of any US state, now has 81,420 persons with Covid-19, and has suffered 4,070 deaths, according to governor Phil Murphy. The state\u2019s leader also worked to combat misinformation surrounding this outbreak, emphasizing that it\u2019s far worse than seasonal flu. Donald Trump, in the early phases of the outbreak in the US, was dismissive of coronavirus and compared it to the flu, although it is many times more deadly and spreads extremely quickly, public health experts continue to warn. Further: Hundreds of people have packed together, shoulder to shoulder today, at a protest organized by conspiracy theorists in Austin, Texas. They chanted: \u201cFire Fauci! Fire Fauci!\u201d Few of the protesters were wearing masks. Footage of a crowd of people calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading public health expert advising the Trump administration, to be fired was captured by the New York Times. The protest at Texas\u2019 capitol was organized by a contributor to the conspiracy theory website InfoWars. Alex Jones, the site\u2019s founder, showed up and bellowed into a bullhorn at the center of the packed crowd. \u201cI see a bunch of healthy Americans out here who don\u2019t seem to be afraid of a virus,\u201d Owen Shroyer, the InfoWars personality who organized the \u201cYou Can\u2019t Close America\u201d protest, told the crowd, according to footage of the protest live streamed on Periscope by an InfoWars supporter. \u201cWhat are they going to do if we have events like this all over the country, with thousands of people showing up, and the virus doesn\u2019t spread like they told us?\u201d Shroyer asked. \u201cIf I want to go out to the gym or the club, or a restaurant, I\u2019m not going to wear a mask,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cNeither am I!\u201d a woman shouted back at him. Shroyer referred to \u201cthe coronavirus hoax\u201d on the livestream, then added that while there was a real virus, \u201cthe hysteria, the shutdown,\u201d was the hoax. We keep an eye on the president\u2019s tweets every day, of course, but don\u2019t report on all of them. This one, however, needs to be disseminated. Fact check: there are nothing accurate in this tweet of Donald Trump\u2019s. It\u2019s been a busy morning and there is more to come. The White House coronavirus task force briefing is due to take place at 5pm ET this evening. Here are the main events so far today: Protests against stay-at-home orders continue, with demonstrators gathering in Annapolis, Maryland, today and also expected in Austin, Texas. New York state, the center of the US outbreak of the coronavirus, has announced that it appears to be past its peak for the disease, although more than 500 people died just yesterday and the state is not out of the woods, and has no timeline for reopening businesses or relaxing social distancing. Queen Elizabeth II has announced low key birthday celebrations this year, because of quarantining during the coronavirus outbreak. Former presidential candidate and sitting Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, whose husband caught coronavirus, accused the Trump administration of losing time by not having a national strategy to combat the coronavirus. Worries continue nationwide in the US over a lack of resources or strategies for mass testing and contact tracing as a way out of lockdown, and at rising protests about restrictions in place to limit the spread of the illness. There\u2019s an update to US coronavirus figures: Johns Hopkins University is now reporting 711,197 confirmed cases and 37,309 deaths. Globally, the confirmed Covid-19 cases now number 2,284,018, with 156,901 fatalities. People in a small Indianapolis suburb have had some welcome financial relief during the pandemic - from anonymous donors. Fortville\u2019s nearly 4,000 residents had their water and sewer bills paid for by anonymous businesses. Residents were informed Friday through a Facebook post, generating a string of grateful comments. \u201cThe town has received a gracious donation with the stipulation that it be used to pay for April water/sewer bills. If you have already paid your April bill, you will see a credit on the May billing,\u201d the post read, according to the AP. Fortville town manager Joe Renner says the total donation was more than $210,000. Renner told The Indianapolis Star newspaper it was pretty great the town had such caring people. Following a rally in Michigan that drew thousands of people, protesters asking the governor to \u201cReopen Maryland\u201d converged on the state\u2019s capital at noon on Saturday. The protesters, who argue that the public health shutdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus are doing more harm than good, have been encouraged to rally by President Donald Trump. The organizers of the \u201cReopen Maryland\u201d event wrote on Facebook that they were asking participants not to leave their cars except in an emergency, but that they aimed to fill Annapolis with as many vehicles as possible, and to make some noise. Early footage from local news outlets in Annapolis showed some streets filled with cars, and though the number of people showing up to attend the protest was not immediately clear. Early images shared on Twitter by people who said they were participating in the \u201cReopen Maryland\u201d protest today showed cars assembling in a mall parking lot. Some of the cars were flying American flags, others Maryland flags, and they were covered in written slogans: \u201cBring Back Small Business!\u201d and \u201cWe the People!\u201d Other people who said they were joining the protest shared photographs of what they had written on their own vehicles. The \u201cReopen Maryland\u201d group is asking Maryland\u2019s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, \u201cto immediately reopen our state\u2019s business, educational and religious institutions\u201d. \u201cThe economic, social and educational disruption caused by shutdowns is guaranteed to cause significant, even greater, harm, leading to increased deaths, economic disruption, loss of livelihood, and educational challenges for Marylanders and their families,\u201d they argued in an online petition. And photojournalist Jim Giordano captured the soundtrack at the protest (beyond the car honking). Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said the United States and Canada have agreed to keep the border closed to non-essential travel for another 30 days in his daily update on the nation\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cCanada and the United States have agreed to extend by another 30 days the border measures that are currently in place,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThis is an important decision and one that will keep people on both sides of the border safe.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s remarks came three days after Trump said the US-Canada border, which is normally crossed by nearly 200,000 people daily, would be among the first to open. The agreement had been set to expire on Tuesday. The prime minister also announced the designation of $306m to support Indigenous businesses across Canada. \u201cThese businesses employ people right across the country, in small communities and big cities alike,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are today signing an executive order allowing people to get their marriage licenses remotely and also allowing clerks to perform ceremonies over video,\u201d the secretary to the New York governor says. \u201cSo if that\u2019s an avenue people want to go down, it will be available to them.\u201d \u201cVideo marriage ceremonies,\u201d Cuomo says with a smile. \u201cThere is now no excuse when the question comes up for marriage. No excuse. You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no.\u201d \u201cThe emotion in this country is as high as I can recall,\u201d Cuomo says, \u201cPeople are frustrated. We\u2019re anxious, we\u2019re scared, we\u2019re angry. We\u2019ve never been through this before. And on every level, this is a terrible experience. It\u2019s disorienting, it threatens you to your core. It makes you reflect on your whole life and it really has ... it\u2019s mentally very difficult, it\u2019s emotionally difficult, economically it\u2019s disastrous. The market goes down, your retirement funds go down, you\u2019re not getting a paycheck. It is as tumultuous a time as we have ever seen. But in the midst of this, there is no time for politics. How does the situation get worse and get worse quickly? If you politicize all that emotion. We cannot go there.\u201d Cuomo invokes Abraham Lincoln\u2019s famous 1858 remark \u2013 \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand\u201d \u2013 noting that it itself was borrowed from Mark 3:25. \u201cThis is accepted wisdom,\u201d he says. \u201cA house cannot rise up from the greatest challenge it has seen since World War II. This is no time and no place for division. We have our hands full as it is. Let\u2019s just stay together and let\u2019s work it through. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re called the United States, right? And the unity was key, going back to Abraham Lincoln. It was always about the unity. Going back to the framers of the Constitution, it was always balance of power to ensure unity. And we need that unity now more than every before.\u201d \u201cTesting is the single most important topic,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cTesting is how you monitor the rate of infection and you control for it.\u201d Cuomo cites New Rochelle as an example of how an outbreak can be controlled with concentrated testing, citing this New York Times story. \u201cThe challenge is now bringing this up to scale,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did 500,000 tests in a month. That\u2019s great news. The bad news is it\u2019s only a fraction of what you need. The more you test, the more information, the more you can reopen society.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the net change in total hospitalizations are down over the last three days. ICU admissions are down, as are intubations across the state. More worryingly, there were 2,000 new hospitalizations yesterday. \u201cThat is still an overwhelming number every day,\u201d Cuomo says at the top of his daily briefing from Albany. \u201cWe\u2019re not at the peak but this is where we were in late March.\u201d He adds there were 540 deaths in the past 24-hour period, down from 630 the day before: \u201cIt\u2019s not as high as it was, but still: 540 people died yesterday.\u201d The United States is struggling to test enough people to track and control the spread of the novel coronavirus. This is a crucial first step to reopening parts of the economy, which Donald Trump is pushing to do by May 1, the AP writes. Trump on Thursday released a plan to ease business restrictions that hinges on a downward trajectory of positive tests. But more than a month after he declared, \u201cAnybody who wants a test, can get a test,\u201d the reality has been much different. People report being unable to get tested. Labs and public officials say critical supply shortages are making it impossible to increase testing to the levels experts say is necessary to keep the virus in check. \u201cThere are places that have enough test swabs, but not enough workers to administer them. There are places that are limiting tests because of the CDC criteria on who should get tested,\u201d said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor at Brown University. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many inefficiencies and problems with the way that testing currently happens across this country.\u201d Trump\u2019s plan envisions setting up \u201csentinel surveillance sites\u201d that would screen people without symptoms in locations that serve older people or minority populations Experts say testing would have to increase as much as threefold to be effective. Fired aircraft carrier\u2019s captain could learn fate soon The Navy\u2019s top admiral will soon decide the fate of the ship captain who was fired after pleading for commanders to move faster to safeguard his coronavirus-infected crew on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. In the glare of a public spotlight, Admiral Mike Gilday will decide whether Navy Captain Brett Crozier stepped out of line when he went around his chain of command and sent an email pushing for action to stem the outbreak, The AP writes. As of Friday, 660 sailors on the aircraft carrier, now docked at the US Pacific territory of Guam, had tested positive for the virus and seven were hospitalized. One sailor has died, and more than 4,000 of the ship\u2019s 5,000 crew members have been moved onto the island for quarantine. Gilday\u2019s review won\u2019t be limited to Crozier. It will also look at the command climate on the ship and higher up within the Pacific-based fleet, to determine if there are broader leadership problems in a region critical to America\u2019s national security interests. Gilday has many options as he reviews what was an extraordinarily rapid investigation by Admiral Robert Burke, the vice chief of naval operations. Burke and his staff finished the review in about a week, conducting interviews almost entirely online and by phone between Washington and Guam. Racial toll of coronavirus grows even starker as more data emerges As a clearer picture emerges of Covid-19\u2019s decidedly deadly toll on black Americans, leaders are demanding a reckoning of the systemic policies they say have made many African Americans far more vulnerable to the virus, including inequity in access to health care and economic opportunity, The Associated Press writes. A growing chorus of medical professionals, activists and political figures are pressuring the federal government to not just release comprehensive racial demographic data of the country\u2019s coronavirus victims, but also to outline clear strategies to blunt the devastation on African Americans and other communities of color. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its first breakdown of Covid-19 case data by race, showing that 30% of patients whose race was known were black. The federal data was missing racial information for 75% of all cases, however, and did not include any demographic breakdown of deaths. The latest AP analysis of available state and local data shows that nearly one-third of those who have died are African American, with black people representing about 14% of the population in the areas covered in the analysis. Roughly half the states, representing less than a fifth of the nation\u2019s COVID-19 deaths, have yet to release demographic data on fatalities. In states that have, about a quarter of the death records are missing racial details.

Protesters, some heavily armed, swarmed the state capitol earlier in the week, briefly chanting: \u201cLock her up\u201d - a strong echo of one of Donald Trump\u2019s most regular prompts about Hillary Clinton at rallies during and since the 2016 election. Last night Trump called such demonstrators \u201cresponsible people\u201d in an ominous echo of the language he used when he said there were \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d after the deadly clashes between white nationalist and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Yesterday Whitmer, a Democrat, declared, unequivocally, in an interview on ABC: \u201c\u201cYou know, I can take it [the protests]. If it makes people feel better to take their frustrations out on me, that\u2019s fine. All I ask is let\u2019s not get overly political here. Let\u2019s focus on the public health.\u201d The governor said she recognized that her stay-at-home order comes with a price as people get laid off and children are prevented from going to school, but also that the order was necessary to protect Michiganders from the Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be six feet apart right now than six feet under,\u201d she said. On CNN this morning, former Michigan Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm said of right restrictions: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to do them but she wants to protect the people of the state - Democrat and Republican. She is not going to [relax] while people\u2019s lives are at stake.\u201d Granholm criticized protesters for not keeping physical distance, handing out candy to children, without wearing face masks or gloves, and by clogging traffic \u201cblocking amblances from getting to the hospital,\u201d she said. Queen Elizabeth II, monarch of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth (ie she\u2019s literally on the money in Canada, Australia and some other members of the Commonwealth) has announced she is canceling the traditional royal gun salute for her birthday on Tuesday, when she turns 94. She will spend the day privately at Windsor Castle, on the outskirts of London, with Prince Philip, 98. Family members are expected to video call her on the day, the Guardian reports. You can follow British developments relating to the coronavirus on our UK live blog. And you can follow global developments on the coronavirus pandemic via our global live blog. Interestingly, the global live blog has a headline relating to the anger US Senator Angus King, of Maine, displayed yesterday, after a call between vice president Mike Pence and some Democratic leaders in the US Senate did not go well. The Dems were frustrated that the federal government is not responding sufficiently to complaints from state officials for more resources for testing and tracking their residents, so they can get a handle on shutting the virus down and opening up their economies. Angus referred to \u201ca dereliction of duty\u201d by the federal government. Latest statistics The number of confirmed US coronavirus cases hit 706,779 this morning -- and nationwide deaths now total 37,079, the latest data indicate. As of the most recent count, 3,574,392 US residents have been tested. To give some perspective: Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak, noted that there are a total of 2,261,631 confirmed cases and 154,789 deaths worldwide. Johns Hopkins also noted that New York City presently has 131,661 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 13,202 fatalities. Researchers at Johns Hopkins also provided updated numbers for New York City, which leads the country with 131,661 confirmed cases and 13,202 deaths. The statistics are sure to change throughout the day. We\u2019ll keep you posted with updates. Here\u2019s Robin McKie, the science and environment editor of the Observer, the Guardian\u2019s sister newspaper (and the oldest surviving Sunday newspaper in the world, FYI). Minnesota Senator and recent 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar just lit into the Trump administration, in a live interview on CNN. Klobuchar\u2019s husband, John Bessler, was desperately sickened by coronavirus, but eventually pulled through after being hospitalized. \u201cYou cannot hold their hand. You cannot hug the healthcare workers\u201d who are caring for your loved one. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific disease,\u201d Klobuchar said. With governors and the federal government at battle stations, Klobuchar pointed to remarks by New York governor Andrew Cuomo yesterday about those disliking the quarantine orders: \u201cIf you\u2019re mad, call me.\u201d Klobuchar said moments ago: \u201cDoes the president of the United States say that? No. At the Republican convention [in 2016 when he snagged the party nomination for the White House] he said \u2018I alone can fix it\u2019, then it was back to the governors [to take responsibility for fighting coronavirus], then he was in charge, then it\u2019s [again] up to the governors. \u201cThere was never a national strategy for testing and a national strategy to prepare our country. If we had not lost those precious months and could have been in better shape right now.\u201d Good morning, US live blog readers, the coronavirus doesn\u2019t rest on weekends and neither do we. Stay tuned for up-to-the-minute news on US politics and the pandemic. There are widespread concerns about the growing occurrence of sporadic protests around the nation. These flared up earlier in the week in several states, most notably Michigan and Minnesota, against the continuance of stay-at-home orders by governors (which follow federal guidelines) as they try to contain the disease. Most US public helath experts believe the number of coronavirus cases has not yet peaked in the US, though the may peak soon. The protests appear to have had a partisan bent, with a preponderance of \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flags, Trump baseball hats and signs criticizing Democratic party state governors, and some demonstrators toting assault rifles. Now Texas, with a Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is expecting protesters to gather today at the state capitol in Austin to call for the reopening of the state\u2019s economy \u2013 and the country\u2019s \u2013 and an end to social distancing orders and business closures. The rally is being called \u201cYou Can\u2019t Close America\u201d. Last night at the White House coronavirus task force briefing, Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, both delivered messages saying that there are enough tests available across the nation to track and control the spread of coronavirus and move to \u201cphase one\u201d reopening of the economy, which non-essential businesses starting up again. This goes against what many governors are saying, some Republicans as well as Democrats, that they do not have enough resources yet to begin safely opening up towards normal life again. And the Guardian is reporting today on some of the right-wing forces, both political and financial, that appear to be driving protesters, whom Trump on Friday called \u201cresponsible people\u201d.",

It\u2019s a term many Australians would have scarcely been familiar with even a month ago. But it\u2019s one of the key techniques in communicable disease control, used by health authorities to monitor and slow the spread of an infection in the community.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/18/australian-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-voluntary-and-with-no-hidden-agenda-minister-says\">Australian coronavirus contact tracing app voluntary and with 'no hidden agenda', minister says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Australia, contact tracing is typically used to monitor the transmission of illnesses such as the measles. It is now at the forefront of the national response to the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>Across the country, teams of doctors, nurses and public health officers talk to Covid-19 patients to help them retrace their movements.

They know we are trying to help them and others out there.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Disease detectives\u2019</h2> \n<p>The profile of contact tracers and the work they do has risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Countries that have had more success in flattening the infection curve, such as South Korea, have used a combination of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said stronger contact tracing was one of three conditions that would need to be met before Australia\u2019s current social distancing restrictions could be eased.</p> \n<p>Improved contact tracing would likely include the use of an app that will trace every person who has been in contact with a mobile phone owner who has tested positive for coronavirus in the previous few weeks.</p> \n<p>Such technology is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/australias-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-what-we-know-so-far\">fraught with privacy issues</a> and there is not yet enough information on how an Australian app would work to say what the implications will be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a2f0b9ff2b90273efdd5ba3c0c08553f541f56d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a2f0b9ff2b90273efdd5ba3c0c08553f541f56d/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman uses the Australian government Covid-19 app on her iPhone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman uses the Australian government Covid-19 app on her iPhone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, the work of contact tracing is conducted by teams working within state public health units.</p> \n<p>Nicknamed \u201cdisease detectives\u201d, these teams can consist of case investigators, contact tracers and case liaison officers, each with clear roles and responsibilities once a case of Covid-19 is confirmed.</p> \n<p>The professional backgrounds of these teams are diverse, ranging from medicine and nursing to medical science, epidemiology and environmental health. They work not just in conjunction with public hospitals, but also GPs, private hospitals and other health facilities patients might have come into contact with.</p> \n<p>Since the arrival of Covid-19, their ranks have swelled to manage the increase in workload. In Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit, which serves a population of about 1.2 million south of the Brisbane river, the team doing this work has grown to 100 people, triple its size before the pandemic.</p> \n<h2>How it begins</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story,\u201d says Dr Shopna Bag. \u201cWhere did it all start?\u201d</p> \n<p>Bag is the director of the public health unit for the western Sydney local health district, which covers areas including Cumberland, Parramatta and Blacktown.</p> \n<p>The unit is based on the Cumberland hospital campus but works with all hospitals in the district, including neighbouring Westmead, as well as local health centres and pharmacies.</p> \n<p>The team includes a communicable diseases manager, surveillance nurses, public health nurses and public health officers. Since the arrival of Covid-19, it has had responsibility for joining the dots in cases such as an outbreak at the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story. Where did it all start?</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Shopna Bag</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Case investigation and contact tracing work begins at the point of diagnosis. The unit receives a notification from a laboratory or the health department of a newly confirmed case. That case is assigned to a team member, often a nurse, who then calls the patient.</p> \n<p>In many cases, this phone call is the moment the patient learns they have coronavirus. For the clinician on the other side of the call, their first priority is the patient\u2019s mental welfare and physical health.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes people are expecting the result, other times it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d says Dr Bhakti Vasant, a public health physician in Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important we gauge what people are feeling over the phone and try to build rapport.\u201d</p> \n<p>The clinician will run through a questionnaire to correctly identify the patient. That is followed by a symptom check. How is the patient feeling today? Are they experiencing any respiratory difficulties? Are they in a hospital or at home in isolation? Do they have any chronic illnesses that place them in a higher risk category of Covid-19 patients?</p> \n<p>Vasant says there have been some cases where staff have had to immediately call an ambulance based on that first phone call.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they\u2019re short of breath or reporting chest pain we do not muck around,\u201d she says.</p> \n<h2>The interview</h2> \n<p>Once the caller establishes the patient is in isolation and well enough to speak, more detailed questioning can begin.</p> \n<p>While its purpose is interrogatory, the interview is kept as relaxed as possible, Bag says.

      "bodyText": "Can you remember everything that you did in a single day? What about for three days? Or every day for a two-week period? In a world before shutdowns and social distancing, could you set out the detail of your daily life; every workplace meeting, each gym session, every date and social event? Who did you meet and for how long? And could you confidently give that information to a stranger if it meant protecting the health of people you care about and the community at large? Welcome to the world of contact tracing. It\u2019s a term many Australians would have scarcely been familiar with even a month ago. But it\u2019s one of the key techniques in communicable disease control, used by health authorities to monitor and slow the spread of an infection in the community. In Australia, contact tracing is typically used to monitor the transmission of illnesses such as the measles. It is now at the forefront of the national response to the coronavirus crisis. Across the country, teams of doctors, nurses and public health officers talk to Covid-19 patients to help them retrace their movements. They\u2019re building a picture that they hope will locate the original source of the patient\u2019s infection as well as any people they might have exposed to the disease. In doing so, they hope to interrupt the transmission of Covid-19 in the community. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this job for a long, long time and you do need to have a skillset,\u201d says Sue Reid, a public health nurse with the ACT\u2019s health protection service. \u201cDetective is one of the terms I use. \u201cBy and large, most people are very cooperative. They know we are trying to help them and others out there.\u201d \u2018Disease detectives\u2019 The profile of contact tracers and the work they do has risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. Countries that have had more success in flattening the infection curve, such as South Korea, have used a combination of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to slow the spread of Covid-19. This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said stronger contact tracing was one of three conditions that would need to be met before Australia\u2019s current social distancing restrictions could be eased. Improved contact tracing would likely include the use of an app that will trace every person who has been in contact with a mobile phone owner who has tested positive for coronavirus in the previous few weeks. Such technology is fraught with privacy issues and there is not yet enough information on how an Australian app would work to say what the implications will be. For now, the work of contact tracing is conducted by teams working within state public health units. Nicknamed \u201cdisease detectives\u201d, these teams can consist of case investigators, contact tracers and case liaison officers, each with clear roles and responsibilities once a case of Covid-19 is confirmed. The professional backgrounds of these teams are diverse, ranging from medicine and nursing to medical science, epidemiology and environmental health. They work not just in conjunction with public hospitals, but also GPs, private hospitals and other health facilities patients might have come into contact with. Since the arrival of Covid-19, their ranks have swelled to manage the increase in workload. In Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit, which serves a population of about 1.2 million south of the Brisbane river, the team doing this work has grown to 100 people, triple its size before the pandemic. How it begins \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story,\u201d says Dr Shopna Bag. \u201cWhere did it all start?\u201d Bag is the director of the public health unit for the western Sydney local health district, which covers areas including Cumberland, Parramatta and Blacktown. The unit is based on the Cumberland hospital campus but works with all hospitals in the district, including neighbouring Westmead, as well as local health centres and pharmacies. The team includes a communicable diseases manager, surveillance nurses, public health nurses and public health officers. Since the arrival of Covid-19, it has had responsibility for joining the dots in cases such as an outbreak at the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown. Case investigation and contact tracing work begins at the point of diagnosis. The unit receives a notification from a laboratory or the health department of a newly confirmed case. That case is assigned to a team member, often a nurse, who then calls the patient. In many cases, this phone call is the moment the patient learns they have coronavirus. For the clinician on the other side of the call, their first priority is the patient\u2019s mental welfare and physical health. \u201cSometimes people are expecting the result, other times it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d says Dr Bhakti Vasant, a public health physician in Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit. \u201cIt\u2019s really important we gauge what people are feeling over the phone and try to build rapport.\u201d The clinician will run through a questionnaire to correctly identify the patient. That is followed by a symptom check. How is the patient feeling today? Are they experiencing any respiratory difficulties? Are they in a hospital or at home in isolation? Do they have any chronic illnesses that place them in a higher risk category of Covid-19 patients? Vasant says there have been some cases where staff have had to immediately call an ambulance based on that first phone call. \u201cIf they\u2019re short of breath or reporting chest pain we do not muck around,\u201d she says. The interview Once the caller establishes the patient is in isolation and well enough to speak, more detailed questioning can begin. While its purpose is interrogatory, the interview is kept as relaxed as possible, Bag says. For this reason, clinicians doing this type of work need multiple qualities: an eye for detail, emotional intelligence, and the ability to listen and make people feel comfortable. Unsurprisingly, they are often natural conversationalists, but with the ability to tease out information and follow threads. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to bombard them with questions, even though we need to tick a box,\u201d Bag says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it in a way that says \u2018just tell us the story\u2019.\u201d The caller asks the patient questions about when they first started to feel unwell. For some Covid-19 patients, the initial symptoms can be so mild they are mistaken for something else, such as hayfever. The caller talks to the patient about every cough, fever, ache, anything that felt a little off and together they identify the date the patient first began to show symptoms. This is done for two reasons. The first is to build a timeline back to the original source of the infection. The second is that the date of symptom onset determines the period in which the patient is considered contagious. Patients with Covid-19 are considered contagious 24 hours before they become symptomatic and this date is used as the starting point to identify close contacts who may have been exposed. The timeline The case investigator then works with the patient to build a timeline. This line of questioning can be a long process says Reid, who is the team investigations manager in the ACT\u2019s health protection service. It is about retracing the patient\u2019s steps, \u201cday-by day, minute-by-minute\u201d, covering every moment of the 14 days up to the first day of symptoms. They\u2019ll use a range of tools, including the calendar on the patient\u2019s mobile phone, if they have one, to try to reconstruct those two weeks. Sometimes, they\u2019ll have the patient try to write a timeline for those 14 days. There are specific questions, such as has the patient travelled internationally or interstate? Where did they go, what mode of transport did they use? If they took a flight somewhere, did they then catch a taxi or Uber? Had they been at work, the gym, a wedding or birthday party? Sometimes it will take multiple calls as the patient starts to recall their movements. \u201cWe don\u2019t stop until we find a source,\u201d Reid says. In some instances, a public health unit might receive several cases at once for which there appears to be a common source, such as a cruise ship with a known outbreak or an institution such as a school or church with other confirmed cases. But Bag says it is important not to make assumptions even if the source might seem obvious. They will still piece together all of the information in case the real clues lie elsewhere. \u201cThis is where we need to be patient and let them tell their story but also explain why we\u2019re asking all these questions,\u201d she says. Contact tracing The other important step in the process is identifying people who could be considered close contacts of the confirmed case. This is anyone who has had 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with the patient in their infectious period, or who has spent two hours in an enclosed space with them. Case investigators will seek information such as flight numbers and seat rows for patients who have travelled. They can then request a flight manifest from the airline to begin the work of identifying people sitting nearby. In the interview, the patient will be asked to remember who they\u2019ve spent time with, at work, at the gym, any parties, religious services or nights out. Who do they live with? The greatest risks of exposure are in the household setting, so identifying household members is a priority in contact tracing. A list is put together and then contact tracers get to work tracking down and notifying those people. In some cases, the patient will be able to supply names and numbers and those individuals might already be expecting a call. Or the public health unit might call a patient\u2019s workplace and ask a manager to check their roster for particular days. On average, most patients will have nine or 10 close contacts. Some only have one. \u201cPeople might have come back from overseas and gone straight to a hotel. Those are ideal situations, they\u2019re very easy,\u201d Reid says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had other instances around Australia where people have had weddings or parties. That\u2019s when it becomes a lot more difficult.\u201d The implication of all of this for a close contact is that they will have to isolate for 14 days. For this reason, contact tracers will also conduct an interview to verify that person meets the criteria for close contact. They will only identify the Covid-19 patient by name if the patient has consented. If a contact is required to go into isolation, some health districts have set up support services such as a daily SMS or call to check on symptoms and advise a test if need be. A case liaison team will also establish whether a patient or close contact needs assistance with things such as accommodation, medication or groceries for their isolation period. The response Government-backed modelling suggests each individual infected with Covid-19 in Australia is passing it on to less than one person on average. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said on Thursday Australia\u2019s high detection rate of Covid-19 cases showed the country\u2019s testing and surveillance regime was highly effective. The teams Guardian Australia spoke to said the majority of patients, and close contacts, were responsive and understood the reasons the contact tracing process was undertaken. \u201cPeople are stressed, tired, not feeling well, you can hear that,\u201d Bag says. \u201cOnce they know why we\u2019re calling and that we\u2019re here to help them and their families, everyone has been really cooperative. \u201cIt\u2019s just that initial pressure. What does this mean for me, my work, my family?\u201d Vasant says people have been \u201cvery understanding\u201d as investigative and contact tracing teams cast their net as wide as necessary in a bid not to miss anyone who might have been exposed. She says the work these public health teams are doing to interrupt the chain of transmission is \u201creally making a difference to the number of cases in Australia\u201d. Teams will run through timelines multiple times. As the patient interview and contact tracing work comes together, they might have gathered information from multiple people. \u201cIt\u2019s like detective work. You can\u2019t rely on a single source of information. You have to take information from multiple sources to piece the puzzle together,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes one new piece of information can take the timeline back a few weeks and we go back to re-interview cases and contact more people.\u201d",

He told PA Media: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I looked at it a few weeks ago I thought: \u2018That\u2019s nigh-on impossible.\u2019 I was very suspicious about how on Earth we\u2019re going to deliver this. But it\u2019s gradually evolved and you realise: \u2018This can work now.\u2019</p> \n   <p>When we turned up here for the first time we said: \u2018Wow, this is a big empty space, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got electricity, it\u2019s got a roof, and nobody\u2019s shooting at you.</p> \n   <p>So actually this is achievable \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in other theatres we\u2019ve been working in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 52-year-old said it was \u201cincredibly impressive\u201d that a high-quality intensive care unit had been set up in what was, in effect, a warehouse.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Somebody said you\u2019re on the train and laying the tracks ahead of you as you are going along \u2013 and that\u2019s absolutely right, you just have to make sure the train doesn\u2019t go too quickly and run away with you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Part of the success, he says, has been through dedication to the welfare of staff, many of whom are working \u201cpretty exhausting\u201d 12-hour shifts. Nightingale workers had borrowed a technique deployed on military operations where staff are paired with a buddy at the start of their shift, encouraging them to look out for one another throughout. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you have eyes with each other when you first go on a shift, you introduce yourselves, and speak to each other after the shift. If they get upset, have a difficult time with a patient or a death, they sit down and have a cup of tea. It worked very well in the past in the military and it\u2019s working very well here,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"780c85dc-9ed5-46a3-83d5-1027c68f2804\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H6pDcV2Lnno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T13:02:24.066Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aa8498f08b7689b030bc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:14:15.598Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning from the UK, folks. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a> </strong>here, taking over the global live blog now to take you through today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as the world continues to battle the pandemic. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:56:37.700Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a98918f08bade1f2957e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T06:14:07.698Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Teachers, nurses and other workers who are regularly exposed to the public must now take a coronavirus test if they want to leave Wuhan, China has ruled.<br><br>The order comes after the central city, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. <br><br>People in Wuhan working in nursing, education, security and other sectors with high exposure to the public must take a nucleic acid test before leaving, the National Health Commission said. <br><br>Since the city relaxed its lockdown restrictions people who arrived in there before Chinese New Year, when the virus was peaking in China, are allowed to go back to their homes. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd/52_149_2913_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The junction of the Han River and the Yangtze River on April 17, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for this live blog for today. We\u2019ve launched a new one at the link below \u2013 head over there for all of the latest developments: A summary of coronavirus news from my US colleagues now: Hundreds flock to Florida\u2019s reopened beaches as state death toll hits 726. Some beaches open with distancing restrictions after governor OKs openings \u2018in a safe way\u2019. Protesters decry stay-at-home orders in Maryland, Texas and Ohio capitals. Rightwing media and Donald Trump have supported demonstrators but they appear to represent a minority opinion. Cuomo believes New York may be past the peak, but more than 500 people died yesterday. The New York governor said the net change in total hospitalizations are down over the last three days. More worryingly, there were 2,000 new hospitalizations yesterday. Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies. Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with George W. Bush over tax policy and then produced a book critical of the administration, died Saturday. He was 84. Amy Klobuchar on US response: \u2018There was never a national strategy\u2019. The former presidential candidate and sitting Minnesota senator, whose husband caught coronavirus, accused the Trump administration of losing time by not having a national strategy to combat the coronavirus. Britain has appointed the former Goldman Sachs investment banker who led the country\u2019s 2012 Olympic planning to organise the domestic manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers treating coronavirus patients. The government has faced severe criticism from doctors and health workers over shortages of equipment, including masks, visors and gowns, and the suggestion that some items might have to be re-used if supplies run out. Paul Deighton, who was chief executive of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, was appointed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday. \u201cHe will lead a singular and relentless focus on PPE as the country\u2019s top manufacturing priority, with the full weight of the government behind him,\u201d Hancock said. Deighton\u2019s unpaid role will be to scale up production domestically, where brands like Barbour and Burberry have already switched factory lines from high-end fashion to PPE. \u201cCountries around the world face unprecedented demand for personal protective equipment and this necessitates an equally unprecedented domestic manufacturing response,\u201d said Deighton. UK care home Covid-19 deaths \u2018may be five times government estimate\u2019 The number of care home residents who have died from coronavirus could be more than five times the government\u2019s estimate, the sector\u2019s main charity has warned. Care England, Britain\u2019s largest representative body for care homes, told the Daily Telegraph that up to 7,500 care home residents may have died of the virus. This is significantly higher than the figure of 1,400 people estimated to have died by the government earlier this week. Hello, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours. A quick reminder that can get in touch with me at any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan \u2013 and away we go. I\u2019ll be logging off shortly. Here\u2019s some of the key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today: Spain\u2019s PM to ask for extension of lockdown to 9 May Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a third 15-day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus, taking the restrictions up to 9 May. Restrictions to be lifted in some US states US president Donald Trump said on Saturday that Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. Turkey\u2019s coronavirus cases overtake Iran to become highest in Middle East Turkey\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Saturday, overtaking neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East. Morocco has extended its lockdown measures by another month Morocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until May 20, the government said on Saturday. France reports 642 more coronavirus deaths as country\u2019s toll hits 19,323 France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running. Donald Trump said on Saturday that China should face unspecified consequences if it was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the coronavirus pandemic. The US president told reportings at a daily briefing: If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences. Trump and senior aides have sharply criticised China for a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out in its Wuhan province. Trump on Saturday also continued casting doubt on China\u2019s death toll, which was revised up on Friday. US president Donald Trump said on Saturday that Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday. \u201cWe continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak,\u201d Trump told reporters at a daily briefing. Some state governors have warned that they will not act prematurely to reopen their economies until there is more testing for the virus, however. Business leaders have also told Trump the country needs to have widespread testing in place before their companies can return to normal operations. On Saturday, Trump said \u201cour testing is getting better and better,\u201d but offered no concrete evidence. He said both Republican and Democratic governors \u201chave announced concrete steps to begin a safe and gradual phased opening.\u201d Texas and Vermont \u201cwill allow certain business to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions,\u201d he said. Several dozen protesters gathered in the Texas capital of Austin on Saturday, chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and \u201cLet us work!\u201d British actress Jameela Jamil on Saturday kicked off an eight-hour global event of music, comedy and personal stories aimed at bringing hope and unity during the coronavirus pandemic. Pop and classical musicians from the North America, Asia and the Middle East, all performing from their homes, appeared on the One World: Together at Home live stream due to run for six hours to pay tribute to frontline workers battling the health crisis around the world. Jamil, known for her TV series \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d told viewers the event was meant to be \u201ca moment of respite.\u201d \u201cPut your wallets away. This is not a fundraiser. We are just here to give you an incredible show with amazing live performances,\u201d she said. The livestream\u2019s first hours featured the likes of David Beckham, American R&amp;B singer Jennifer Hudson, Hong Kong singer Eason Chan, India\u2019s Vishal Mishra and Emirati musician Hussain Al Jassmi. That will be followed by a two-hour concert broadcast on Saturday night across multiple television channels and featuring stars including The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish. The event, curated by Lady Gaga and organized by WHO and Global Citizen, is the biggest celebrity effort so far to mark the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 people worldwide. Watch the event here: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family must wait for another day to find out if her temporary release for a prison in Iran has been extended. The British-Iranian mother was temporarily released from Evin prison in Tehran in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s furlough was extended by two weeks in late March, and she was scheduled to return to prison on Saturday. The Free Nazanin Campaign said on Twitter that her family had not yet received a decision on whether or not her furlough is to be extended, and were told to return to the Prosecutors Office in Iran on Sunday. \u201cNazanin\u2019s family spoke with the Prosecutors Office today for an update on whether her furlough is to be extended beyond this weekend, or if she will have to return to prison,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cThey were told to come back tomorrow for an answer.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been living in relative isolation at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran while the country gets to grips with the outbreak. She has to wear an ankle tag during the furlough, and can only go within a 300-metre range of her parents\u2019 home. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport while travelling to show her young daughter, Gabriella, to her parents in April 2016. She was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations, which she denies, of plotting to overthrow the Tehran government. She was later afforded diplomatic protection by the UK government, which argues that she is innocent and that her treatment by Iran failed to meet obligations under international law. Twickenham has become the latest major sports stadium in Britain to be given a role in the fight against the coronavirus, reports AFP. The headquarters of English rugby union, located in south-west London, will host a drive-through coronavirus testing facility that is part of the British government\u2019s nationwide effort to increase testing for thousands more NHS staff and other key workers. \u201cThis new service will help end the uncertainty of whether NHS and social care staff and other key workers need to stay at home, meaning those who test negative will be able to return to work,\u201d said health minister Lord James Bethell. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a third 15-day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the new coronavirus, taking the restrictions up to 9 May. Sanchez said he wanted to relax restrictions on children, who would be allowed out of their homes after 27 April, though that allowance would be \u201climited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion\u201d. He did not go into further details. Spain has begun to ease a strict lockdown imposed on 14 March and this week opened up some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing. But most people are still confined to their houses except for essential outings including shopping for food. The UK government is arranging a repatriation flight on Wednesday to bring back nationals in Sierra Leone, PA Media reports. British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependents in Sierra Leone will be able to book tickets for the special flight on Wednesday for \u00a3600 per person, but only those who are normally resident in the UK will be eligible to travel. The flight will leave Freetown International Airport at 6.55pm on 22 April, arriving at Stansted Airport in the early hours of 23 April. Passengers travelling from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, must report to the Sea Coach terminal in the Aberdeen area of the city between 12pm and 3pm on Wednesday. Some 5,000 people are or have been repatriated from India on 21 previously announced flights operating from 8-20 April. A church in Bergamo that served as a temporary morgue at the height of Italy\u2019s coronavirus epidemic \u201cis finally empty\u201d, the mayor said Saturday. Where dozens of coffins once stood, nothing but flowers are left to be seen in a photograph tweeted by mayor Giorgio Gori that symbolises the easing of a crisis that has killed over 23,000 people in Italy. Bergamo is in the wealthy northern region of Lombardy, which accounts for over half Italy\u2019s virus victims. Italy\u2019s coronavirus emergency czar Domenico Arcuri said Saturday that five times as many people had died in the region during the epidemic than had been killed in Milan during World War II bombings. \u201cWe are living through a great tragedy, which we have not yet overcome,\u201d he said, describing the nearly 12,000 Lombardy dead as an \u201castounding\u201d figure. About 20 workers in Afghanistan\u2019s president Ashraf Ghani\u2019s palace have tested positive for the coronavirus, two officials told AFP on Saturday, but so far, there is no indication the president himself has been infected. \u201cTwenty-odd people are infected with COVID-19 in the presidential palace. However, it is (being) kept under wraps to ensure no panic is caused,\u201d one government official said. A second official confirmed the number and said an additional 12 people from the president\u2019s administrative office had also contracted the virus. Ghani\u2019s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi declined to comment and referred questions to the health ministry, which also would not comment, saying it did not disclose the identity of its patients. Kabul is currently on a coronavirus lockdown, which authorities recently extended for three weeks, and all government offices are shut. Afghanistan has officially reported only 933 cases of coronavirus, including 33 deaths. France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running. France\u2019s public health authority said in a statement that the total number of people in intensive care units also fell for the 10th day in a row, to 5,833 - the lowest level since March 31. The figures show that the numbers of infections and deaths remain at a high level but having reached a plateau a week ago the curve is beginning to go noticeably downwards. Unlike in the UK, deaths in care homes are included in the figures. France has been in virtual lockdown since March 17 as part of efforts to curb the outbreak. Morocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until May 20, the government said on Saturday. The decision was made by the government council as the number of confirmed cases rose to 2,685, including 137 deaths and 314 recoveries., Reuters reports. Lockdown conditions imposed on March 20 mean people are only allowed to go out to buy food or medicine and to staff some key jobs. Morocco has made wearing masks mandatory with those who fail to do so risking jail terms and fines. Schools, mosques, non-essential shops and entertainment venues have all been closed. The country has been paying wages to those unable to work and deferred taxes and loans for small businesses to ease the economic pain related to the lockdown measure. Turkey\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Saturday, overtaking neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East. An increase of 3,783 cases in the last 24 hours also pushed Turkey\u2019s confirmed tally within a few hundred of China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged. Koca said 121 more people have died, taking the death toll to 1,890. A total of 1,822 people have recovered from coronavirus so far, and the number of tests carried out over the past 24 hours came to 40,520, the minister said. The interior ministry also said it was extending restrictions on travel between 31 cities for a further 15 days starting at midnight on Saturday. Here are the developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today: Spain coronavirus deaths hit 20,000 The coronavirus death toll in Spain, one of the world\u2019s worst-hit countries by the pandemic, has topped 20,000 after 565 new fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours. The number of the total dead from Covid-19 in the country hit 20,043 on Saturday. The rise was slightly lower than Friday, when an additional 585 deaths were recorded. The number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 191,726 on Saturday from 188,068 on Friday, the country\u2019s health ministry added. UK\u2019s Covid-19 hospital death toll surpasses 15,000 In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has passed 15,000 \u2013 with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm on Friday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died. Robert Jenrick, the local government secretary, said during the UK\u2019s daily briefing that a significant consignment of PPE is due to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, which will include 400,000 gowns. Bangladesh garment workers pack streets to demand wages during coronavirus lockdown Hundreds of workers in Bangladesh have taken to the streets in defiance of physical distancing rules to demand unpaid wages during the Covid-19 shutdown. The country, which is the world\u2019s second-largest clothing producer after China, is predicted to lose about $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) of export revenues this financial year as retailers and brands across the world cancel orders. The government sent troops out into the streets to help enforce a shutdown on travel and restrictions on gatherings. New York daily death toll at two-week low Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since the beginning of April. Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, said new hospital admissions stayed around the 2,000-patient mark, which he said was still an \u201coverwhelming number\u201d. Meanwhile, Cuomo said \u201cthis is no time for division\u201d and that the pandemic was the \u201cgreatest challenge since world war two\u201d following an attack on Twitter by US president Donald Trump. Some shops in Iran have reopened as country\u2019s daily death toll fell to 73 Iran allowed some businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll from coronavirus fell to 73, its lowest in more than a month. So-called low-risk businesses \u2013 including many shops, factories and workshops \u2013 resumed operations in Tehran, a week after reopening in the rest of the country, state television said. Croatia extends its lockdown for another 15 days Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions. Shops, bars, restaurants and schools were closed a month ago, with public transport also stopped, leaving open only food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations. People have only been allowed to leave their homes to buy essentials, seek medical treatment, go for a walk or do an exercise, but not in a group and avoiding social contact. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said \u201cthis is no time for division,\u201d during his daily briefing on Saturday, following an attack on Twitter by Donald Trump, the US president. He also announced the daily death toll for New York was at two-week low. He said the pandemic was the \u201cgreatest challenge since world war two\u201d and that it is as \u201ctumultuous a time as we have ever seen,\u201d adding \u201cit is no time for politics.\u201d On Friday, Cuomo fired back at criticism from Trump over whether the state had requested too much federal help during the pandemic. In one tweet, Trump had said the Democratic governor should spend more time \u201cdoing\u201d and less time \u201ccomplaining.\u201d Following this Cuomo said: \u201cFirst of all, if he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work.\u201d Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since April began. Cuomo also said new hospital admissions stayed around the 2,000-patient mark, which he said was \u201cstill an overwhelming number.\u201d He said that contact tracing would require \u201can army,\u201d and he called on the federal government to coordinate the ramping up of testing. Iran allowed some businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll from coronavirus fell to 73, its lowest in more than a month. So-called low-risk businesses \u2013 including many shops, factories and workshops \u2013 resumed operations in Tehran, a week after reopening in the rest of the country, state television said. Television footage showed health inspectors visiting shops and reminding a baker that he was required to wear a mask despite working near a hot oven. Other inspectors were seen controlling stores where employees handed out gloves to customers. Pakistan has taken the decision to lift restrictions on congregational prayers at mosques, but a host of safety conditions have been put in place to avert the further spread of coronavirus, the government announced on Saturday. The south Asian nation, the second most populous Muslim country in the world, imposed the restrictions less than a month ago, allowing only three to five people at mosques for prayers. The decision to lift restrictions, taken in a meeting between Pakistani president Arif Alvi and religious leaders, comes less than a week before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in which the size of congregations typically increases, Reuters reports. \u201cMosques are given permission conditional to taking due precautions,\u201d a statement following the meeting said, adding that it was mandatory for mosque visitors to wear masks. Pakistan has registered 7,638 cases of coronavirus and 143 deaths, with health experts warning that congregations pose the biggest threat to the limited healthcare infrastructure of the country of more than 200 million people. According to the statement, worshippers will have to maintain a two-metre (6ft) distance from each other instead of the usual Muslim practice of praying shoulder-to-shoulder and mosque administrations will disinfect premises regularly. The government had been under pressure to reverse the congregation restrictions, and clashes between mosque attendees and police had been reported in Karachi, the country\u2019s largest city. Earlier this week renowned clerics threatened to violate the restrictions, saying prayers were essential for Muslims and should be allowed as long as safety measures were observed. While the government has reversed the restrictions, the statement warned that it reserved the right to review the matter if guidelines were violated. It is thought that Pakistan could see a peak in the spread of coronavirus in mid-May. Hi, this is Nicola Slawson in the UK. I\u2019m taking over the reins of the live blog now. Please do share any thoughts, insight or news tips with me via any of the channels below. I might not have time to respond to all of you but I will certainly try and read them. Thank you. Twitter: @nicola_slawson Instagram: @nicola_slawson Email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com Hundreds of workers in Bangladesh have taken to the streets in defiance of social distancing rules to demand unpaid wages during the Covid-19 shutdown. The country, which is the world\u2019s second-largest clothing producer after China, is predicted to lose about $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) of export revenues this financial year as retailers and brands across the world cancel orders. It has sent troops out into the streets to help enforce a shutdown on travel and restrictions on gatherings. But crowds of workers poured onto the streets in the port city of Chittagong on Saturday, saying they were still waiting for last month\u2019s wages. Police talked to one factory owner who had promised to make the payments by 28 April, a local officer told Reuters. Last month Bangladesh\u2019s government launched a $588m package to help companies in the garment sector pay staff during the pandemic, but manufacturers have said it is not enough. Bangladesh reported 306 new cases of coronavirus and nine more deaths on Saturday, taking the total to 2,144 confirmed cases and 84 fatalities. Though the official figures are relatively low compared to other countries, health officials have warned that the infection could still spread fast through the surrounding south Asia region, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population where millions live in packed slums with fragile public health systems. Neighbouring India reported 991 new confirmed cases and 42 deaths from the virus on Saturday, taking the total number of reported cases to 14,378 and fatalities to 480. At least five people have died, including a young girl, and several others were injured in a stampede when government officials in north-east Nigeria distributed cash and clothes to thousands of desperate people displaced by jihadist violence. Around 70,000 people live in displacement camps in Borno state\u2019s Gamboru, a town near the Cameroonian border. This morning, as a government convoy was handing out money and garments, mainly to women and children in Gamboru, a stampede for the aid was created, killing four women and a young girl, local hospital officials said. Local civilian militias, engaged in the conflict with jihadist groups, told AFP the death toll was higher, with more than 12 women and children losing their lives. A decade since Boko Haram\u2019s insurgency in north-east Nigeria began, the conflict continues to rage, with almost 2 million people displaced from their homes and reliant on support from the government and aid groups. In 2016, a faction loyal to the Islamic State terror group split from Boko Haram, further complicating and deepening a conflict which has claimed at least 36,000 lives and spread into neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon. France will try to avoid setting different rules for elderly people once the government starts easing its coronavirus confinement measures, the president\u2019s office has said, amid criticism at the impact of the lockdown on the older generation. It comes as president Emmanuel Macron sparked a backlash in recent days, after he said on Monday that older people, who are considered more vulnerable to the deadly virus, would be asked to stay home for longer. The lockdown in France, which approached 19,000 Covid-19 deaths yesterday, includes restrictions on store openings and people\u2019s movements which will remain in place until at least May 11, Macron has confirmed. After that, schools and shops are set to reopen, though it is still unclear at what speed France will allow some businesses like hotels or cafes to restart, and whether it plans to lift home confinement recommendations for everyone at the same time. Professor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council advising the government on the epidemic, also fuelled the debate after he proposed that confinement should continue for people aged 65 to 70 and above. \u201cThe president has followed the growing debate about the situation for elderly citizens after 11 May,\u201d the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace told Reuters on Saturday. He does not want there to be any discrimination among citizens after 11 May in the context of a gradual easing of confinement measures, and will appeal to people\u2019s individual responsibility.\u201d The government is still likely to recommend that some people should stay at home for their own protection, however. \u201cWe will ask the most vulnerable people, older people, severely disabled people, and those who suffer from chronic illnesses, to remain in confinement even after 11 May, at least in a first instance,\u201d Macron said in his televised address on 13 April. I know it\u2019s a major constraint ... But we\u2019ll have to try to abide by this to protect you, it\u2019s in your interest.\u201d Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions. Shops, bars, restaurants and schools were closed a month ago, with public transport also stopped, leaving open only food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations. People have only been allowed to leave their homes to buy essentials, seek medical treatment, go for a walk or do an exercise, but not in a group and avoiding social contact. Interior minister Davor Bo\u017einovi\u0107 said on Saturday that the government was considering relaxing certain measures to help the economy, while at the same time continuing to protect the health of citizens, Reuters reports. One such measure could be easing the restriction on leaving their homes, but travel would be possible only within their own region of the country. Travelling between different regions would remain barred unless people have a permit for specific business or medical reasons. The minister gave no timeframe for a decision, with the government due to convene for a session on Thursday. The country has recorded 1,832 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 39 deaths. On Saturday the number of new infections rose by 18, the lowest daily increase registered since 17 March. The number of new cases has been dipping in recent days, with 50 new cases on Thursday and 23 on Friday. In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 15,000 \u2013 with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm yesterday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died. The 888 new recorded daily deaths mark a slight increase from yesterday, when 847 were reported, and figures earlier this week when daily deaths dropped to 717 . The deadliest day so far in the UK was just over a week ago when 980 fatalities were recorded in hospitals. My colleague Adam Gabbatt reports that thousands of people are preparing to attend protests across the US in the coming days, as a rightwing movement against stay-at-home orders, backed by wealthy conservative groups and promoted by Donald Trump, continues to take hold. Conservative activists are demanding governors lift orders designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, despite the recommendations of public health officials. Trump, who has clashed with Democratic governors over how soon to reopen the US economy, tweeted his support on Friday, in an unprecedented endorsement of civil disobedience by a sitting president. Many of the planned rallies have been inspired by a protest at the Michigan state capitol on Wednesday, which was attended by thousands. He has conquered some of Europe\u2019s most challenging mountain bike climbs and is a former Tour de France champion. Now Geraint Thomas has completed a feat of a different kind, finishing a 36-hour indoor cycling stint to raise more than \u00a3300,000 for the NHS in the UK as it continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The Welshman rode three 12-hour sessions, each designed to emulate the length of a NHS worker\u2019s shift, in the garage of his Cardiff home to raise funds, finishing his last yesterday. \u201cNo exaggeration, the last two hours were the hardest I have ever had on the bike,\u201d he told the BBC on Saturday. \u201cI could barely sit down,\u201d he added. As of writing, the sportsman has raised nearly \u00a3334,000. Here\u2019s an update he posted on Twitter yesterday: North Korean authorities reportedly told citizens in public lectures that there were confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country as early as the end of March \u2013 despite official claims that it has not had any. The lecturers, speaking to organisations and neighbourhood watch groups, said there were Covid-19 cases within the country, without giving any numbers, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported, citing two sources, one in Pyongyang and one in Ryanggang province. The lecturers said the confirmed cases were in Pyongyang, South Hwanghae province and North Hamgyong province, RFA reported. Pyongyang had previously reinforced border checks and ordered foreigners from any country that has reported a case of Covid-19 to spend 30 days in quarantine, flying dozens of diplomats out of the country in early March. The number of Covid-19 deaths in the Netherlands has increased by 142 to 3,601, with an additional 1,140 confirmed cases taking the total to 31,589, the country\u2019s health authorities have confirmed. Elsewhere, in Switzerland the death toll from coronavirus has reached 1,111, according to the country\u2019s public health agency, rising from 1,059 a day earlier. The number of people testing positive for the disease was up by 326, making a total of 27,404. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here back at the helm of the live blog now, with thanks to my colleague Molly Blackall for covering while I took a short break. More news from Russia where authorities recorded a record daily rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, with nearly 5,000 new infections, and president Vladimir Putin ordered the government to provide daily forecasts. The government must \u201cprovide a short-term prognosis of the number of citizens who may contract the new infectious disease (Covid-19)\u201d and report its estimates on a daily basis, according to an order published on the Kremlin\u2019s website. It came after the coronavirus death toll rose to 313 in the country. The number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by 40 overnight, with authorities reporting 4,785 new cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 36,793. Here are a few of the most poignant pieces of coronavirus photojournalism from around the world today. In Switzerland, 27,404 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, up from 27,078 a day earlier. The death toll has also risen to 1,111 from 1,059, the country\u2019s health agency said. Amazon has begun using thermal cameras inside its warehouses to screen workers who could be infected with coronavirus, employees have told Reuters. The cameras record how much heat is emitted from a person, with temperature being one of the most common symptoms of the virus. Cases of coronavirus have been reported among staff at more than 50 of Amazon\u2019s US warehouses. Some workers have walked out on their work, after concerns over their safety, and unions and officials have called on Amazon to shut down the buildings. In France, Amazon has closed six of its fulfilment centres temporarily \u2013 one of the biggest fallouts yet from a dispute with workers over the risks of coronavirus contagion. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the blog while my colleague Simon has a break. If you spot something you think we should be covering, you can drop me a tweet @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t always be able to respond, but will endeavour to read them all. The coronavirus death toll in Spain, one of the world\u2019s worst-hit countries by the pandemic, has topped 20,000 after 565 new fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours. The number of the total dead from Covid-19 in the country hit 20,043 on Saturday. The rise was slightly lower than Friday, when an additional 585 deaths were recorded. The number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 191,726 on Saturday from 188,068 on Friday, the country\u2019s health ministry added. More from Afghanistan where it has now emerged that at least 20 officials working at president Ashraf Ghani\u2019s palace have tested positive for coronavirus. Extraordinarily, the outbreak is thought to have been caused by a contaminated document delivered to the palace from another government department, according to a senior health official. It has prompted the 70-year-old leader to limit most of his contact with staff to digital communication. \u201cA contaminated document was sent to an office inside the palace from another government department and that\u2019s how the employees were infected,\u201d an official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cSome of the employees were still working in their offices when the results came out, and we had to quarantine them and their families, but the numbers could be higher,\u201d the official added. Sediq Sediqqi, Ghani\u2019s spokesman, said the Civil Service Commission has already asked government employees to stay at home before the tests were conducted and that order has been extended for another three weeks. A government source told Reuters that Ghani, who in the past has said he suffered from health issues related to his stomach, has limited contact with staff, conducting most meetings through video conference calls and meeting only a handful in his inner circle in person. Hundreds of British nationals stranded in Bangladesh amid the coronavirus pandemic will be repatriated after the UK government chartered four flights. Sick and elderly people, deemed most at risk, will be given priority, the Foreign Office said. Up to 850 Britons are expected to board the new flights, which will leave the capital, Dhaka, for London on 21, 23, 25 and 26 of April, the department said. FCO minister of state Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: We are in a truly unprecedented situation, and I know people are concerned about getting home to their loved ones. Foreign Office staff in the UK and Bangladesh have been working tirelessly with the Bangladeshi authorities to help British travellers who want to come back to the UK and these flights mean people can now do that. Tickets will cost \u00a3600 per person and travellers will also be able to board transfer flights to the capital from Sylhet, in the country\u2019s north east. It comes after the UK government announced 17 chartered flights from India and 10 from Pakistan, expected to bring home around 4,000 and 2,500 passengers respectively. In the UK, the Queen\u2019s birthday on Tuesday will not be marked by gun salutes, in what is believed to be a first, due to the coronavirus crisis. A Buckingham Palace source said the Queen\u2019s 94th birthday would not be marked in any special way, adding that any calls with family would be kept private. The source told PA: \u201cThere will be no gun salutes \u2013 Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances.\u201d It follows reports that the pandemic has also forced Princess Beatrice to cancel her royal wedding due to take place next month. Iran\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll has topped 5,000. In the last 24 hours, there have been 73 new coronavirus deaths bringing the country\u2019s total to 5,031 so far, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour has told state TV. The daily death toll is one of the lowest in recent days, he said, adding that the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country has reached 80,868. According to a parliamentary report released earlier this week, the coronavirus death toll might be almost double the figure announced by the health ministry, and the number of infections eight to 10 times higher. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East, with one of the world\u2019s highest coronavirus-related death tolls. Extra supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) will be delivered directly to more than 1,000 care homes in Scotland, as concerns about supply and quality of PPE continue. While the care sector usually sources its own PPE, the pandemic has put extreme pressure on supply chains with concerns raised earlier this week that some manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to Scotland. The Scottish government announced overnight that the NHS National Services Scotland would prioritise the delivery of stock directly to care homes where the virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local hubs which supply PPE to other social care workers. Yesterday, the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) claimed new PPE for officers would not provide any \u201cmeaningful protection\u201d, after Police Scotland announced staff would be given surgical face masks to wear when adhering to social distancing measures was not possible. But the SPF said that its new expert panel, set up in response to the pandemic, had refused to endorse the type two masks. An interesting study has emerged in the US which found that the number of people infected with coronavirus could be as much as 85 times higher than previously thought. The research from Stanford University, which was published on Friday, tested samples from 3,330 people in Santa Clara county, in California, and found the virus to be 50 to 85 times more common than official figures indicated. The study, the first large-scale one of its kind, has yet to be peer reviewed and was conducted by identifying antibodies in healthy individuals through a finger prick test, which indicated whether they had already contracted and recovered from the virus. At the time of the study, Santa Clara county had 1,094 confirmed cases of Covid-19, resulting in 50 deaths. But, based on the rate of people who have antibodies, it is likely that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in the county by early April \u2013 a number approximately 50 to 80 times higher. The Covid-19 death toll in Russia has risen to 313, as the country recorded a record daily jump in confirmed infections. The number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by 40 overnight, with authorities reporting 4,785 new cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 36,793. Moscow, which became the centre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak and was also the first region in the country to introduce a lockdown, recorded 2,649 new cases and 21 new deaths, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said. Infections began rising sharply this month, although the country had reported far fewer infections than many western European nations in the outbreak\u2019s early stages, Reuters reported. However, like some other nations, health authorities in Russia are not carrying out mass testing. Private testing results in Moscow among people without symptoms suggest the virus has penetrated more deeply into its population than official data shows. Elsewhere, Indonesia has reported 15 new Covid-19 deaths, taking the total to 535, as well as 325 new confirmed infections. It takes the total number of infections in the country, the world\u2019s fourth most populous with a quarter of a billion people, to 6,248. A study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released last month estimated that as few as 2% of Indonesia\u2019s coronavirus infections have been reported. On Friday, Indonesia surpassed the Philippines to become the country with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. It has the most number of deaths in Asia outside of China. Afghanistan\u2019s health minister, Ferozuddin Feroz, has warned that Covid-19 cases will continue to rise as the number of confirmed infections reached 933 and lockdown measures have been extended. Feroz has said that if some people continue not to take the virus seriously, more will get infected. Despite partial curfews and lockdowns in some provinces, streets are packed with vehicles and people walk around freely. In the last 24 hours, 27 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, Feroz said. Of new cases, 12 were confirmed in Kabul, taking the total number of infections to 276 in the capital. The city is under full lockdown in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus, with measures extended for three more weeks. The health minister has also confirmed three new deaths of people who had contracted coronavirus in the same period, bringing the total number of deaths to 33. There have been 112 recoveries. The lockdown is also being implemented in provincial districts and roads connecting Kabul with other provinces remain closed. Herat, which has so far been the worst affected area in Afghanistan, has had fewer new confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days with only two new cases reported today. The total number in the province stands at 328. The country\u2019s finance ministry said on Friday that Afghanistan was seeking more foreign aid to help fight the pandemic. According to the ministry, the government needs around $350m (\u00a3280m). Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been accused of a dereliction of duty by a senator over its failure to rapidly expand coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator of Maine, vented his frustration to vice-president Mike Pence during a call yesterday, according to reports. \u201cI have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,\u201d King reportedly said during the call. He later tweeted: The White House coronavirus taskforce has pushed back at widespread criticism that the US lacks the testing capacity to end lockdowns and reopen its economy. According to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Medicine coronavirus resource centre, the US has over 706,000 confirmed cases and more than 37,000 deaths, with 3.5 million people tested to date. Some 700 Taiwanese navy sailors are being put in quarantine after three Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a goodwill mission to the Pacific island state of Palau, the country\u2019s government has announced. Three Taiwan navy vessels visited Palau \u2013 an archipelago of islands which was under US administration until its independence in 1994 and one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan \u2013 in the middle of March, before returning to Taiwan a month later, Chen Shih-chung, the health minister, said. The three confirmed cases had all shared quarters on the same ship, but all 700 sailors on all three ships were being recalled and would be put into quarantine, he added. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said that President Tsai Ing-wen had been at the ceremony to welcome back the ships but had only waved to the sailors from the shore and had not been exposed to the risk of infection. Taiwan, which has a population of approximately 23 million, has so far only reported 398 coronavirus cases and six deaths. A pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers. They are among those facing eviction from their homes in California and being made homeless during the Covid-19 pandemic despite promised tenants\u2019 rights protections. My colleague Sam Levin reports that some landlords are proceeding to expel tenants from their homes, indicating there are significant gaps in the new regulations. Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic. Virginia G\u00f3mez, a 51-year-old mother of six from Los Angeles who has been threatened with eviction from her home of three years as she can\u2019t afford the rent, said: I told the police, \u2018You guys are wearing masks and gloves, but you want to throw us out to the streets when the virus is out there?\u2019 How are we supposed to \u2018stay at home\u2019 when they kick us out?\u201d Last month, California\u2019s governor ordered a two-month statewide delay on imposing evictions for people who cannot pay rent due to Covid-19. The order prevents the enforcement of evictions until the end of May, but requires tenants to repay the full amount later. But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. Singapore has reported a record daily rise in the number of coronavirus cases, with 942 infections today. It takes Covid-19 cases in the country \u2013 which has a population of 5.7 million \u2013 to 5,992. The country\u2019s ministry of health said the vast majority of cases were work permit holders living in foreign worker dormitories. It follows my colleague, Rebecca Ratcliffe, reporting yesterday that the country, praised for its gold standard approach to tracing coronavirus cases, is facing a surge in transmission linked to its cramped migrant workers\u2019 dormitories, where thousands more infections are expected to emerge. Officials have been accused of overlooking the dormitories, where between 12 and 20 men might share a single room. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has hit 10,000 in Japan, the country\u2019s public broadcaster has reported. It comes just days after Japan\u2019s state of emergency was extended to the entire nation in a bid to stem the spread of the disease. Yesterday, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appealed for people to stay indoors amid fears medical services could fail. Just over 200 people have died from the virus in Japan, with Tokyo being the hardest-hit area. The city recorded 201 new infections on Friday, a new record, and an additional 181 cases today. In the UK, a senior clinician at the first Nightingale hospital, the world\u2019s largest critical care facility which was built in less than a fortnight, has called for military expertise to help protect the mental health of staff and volunteers. Prof James Calder, who had a 14-year military career and is one of the clinical leads at NHS Nightingale in east London, said it was crucial to call on veterans who have worked in challenging situations as the UK rapidly expands its hospital care capacity to deal with the pandemic. One report this week suggested the hospital was failing to help the capital\u2019s \u201cdrowning\u201d intensive care units and had diverted much-needed equipment away from the city\u2019s hospitals. The vast new hospital had just 30 patients on Tuesday, the Independent reported. Prof Calder admitted he was sceptical about the new facility when he was brought on board but had been overwhelmed by what he characterised as early success. He told PA Media: When I looked at it a few weeks ago I thought: \u2018That\u2019s nigh-on impossible.\u2019 I was very suspicious about how on Earth we\u2019re going to deliver this. But it\u2019s gradually evolved and you realise: \u2018This can work now.\u2019 When we turned up here for the first time we said: \u2018Wow, this is a big empty space, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got electricity, it\u2019s got a roof, and nobody\u2019s shooting at you. So actually this is achievable \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in other theatres we\u2019ve been working in. The 52-year-old said it was \u201cincredibly impressive\u201d that a high-quality intensive care unit had been set up in what was, in effect, a warehouse. Somebody said you\u2019re on the train and laying the tracks ahead of you as you are going along \u2013 and that\u2019s absolutely right, you just have to make sure the train doesn\u2019t go too quickly and run away with you. Part of the success, he says, has been through dedication to the welfare of staff, many of whom are working \u201cpretty exhausting\u201d 12-hour shifts. Nightingale workers had borrowed a technique deployed on military operations where staff are paired with a buddy at the start of their shift, encouraging them to look out for one another throughout. \u201cIf you have eyes with each other when you first go on a shift, you introduce yourselves, and speak to each other after the shift. If they get upset, have a difficult time with a patient or a death, they sit down and have a cup of tea. It worked very well in the past in the military and it\u2019s working very well here,\u201d he said. Good morning from the UK, folks. Simon Murphy here, taking over the global live blog now to take you through today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as the world continues to battle the pandemic. Teachers, nurses and other workers who are regularly exposed to the public must now take a coronavirus test if they want to leave Wuhan, China has ruled. The order comes after the central city, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. People in Wuhan working in nursing, education, security and other sectors with high exposure to the public must take a nucleic acid test before leaving, the National Health Commission said. Since the city relaxed its lockdown restrictions people who arrived in there before Chinese New Year, when the virus was peaking in China, are allowed to go back to their homes. More than 2.2 million people have now been infected worldwide with Covid-19 and at least 154,219 people have died since the outbreak began, according to Johns Hopkins University. The figures, which are based on official data and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes. Here is the latest summary of the biggest developments around the world: Thailand has reported 33 new coronavirus infections, bringing the country\u2019s total to 2,733 cases. Eleven of the new cases were in Bangkok and had a history of going to public areas, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration. Some have questioned if the low number of detected cases is down to a lack of testing in the country. Thailand has reported 47 fatalities since the outbreak escalated in January. No new deaths were reported on Saturday. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen by 3,609 to 137,439, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. This post has been updated to clarify that the number of daily cases often fluctuates over the course of a week, and that this may reflect the number of tests being carried out each day. Thank you to readers who have got in touch about this. Both Robert Koch Institute and Johns Hopkins University have a lot of useful data showing daily cases in Germany. China is pushing to reopen its economy. State media reported plans to increase government spending and cut market loan rates. This follows reports on Friday that the country\u2019s economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020, the country\u2019s first such contraction on record. President Donald Trump said protestors who flouted social distancing measures \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d. Some states are going too far with social distancing measures, he said, but he did not believe stay-at-home orders should be dropped altogether Democratic lawmakers have called for anti-bias training for police officers. People in communities of color have concern about being profiled while wearing masks or other face coverings in public. Syria\u2019s Kurdish-led northeast has confirmed first case of coronavirus. Agencies have warned that health infrastructure in the northeast, which has been shattered by war, would be unable to cope with an outbreak. Japan is scrambling to expand testing. Drive-through facilities and general practitioners will help increase the samples being taken. There is alarm over rising coronavirus deaths and a worsening crisis facing the country\u2019s emergency medical system. Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States have once again been temporarily suspended. This follows news that migrants who arrived in the country on Monday were infected with Covid-19. All airline passengers in Canada must now wear masks, the country\u2019s transport regular has said. Australia\u2019s coronavirus-related death toll rose by three to a total of 68 on Saturday, health data showed. The daily growth rate of new infections has steadied in the country, following the introduction of strict curbs on public movement. Australia recorded 36 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases to 6,533, according to the health ministry data. The government has stepped up calls for people to sign up for a controversial movement-tracking mobile phone app, which ministers say will help the government to monitor outbreaks. Government services minister Stuart Robert said there would there will be no surveillance involved with the app, which is to be ready within weeks. \u201cThe app is simply a health app,\u201d Robert said in a televised briefing. Prime minister Scott Morrison has also said that people are being asked to download the app voluntarily. Here\u2019s a brief summary of some the developments from the US, including Friday\u2019s White House briefing. President Donald Trump said that protestors who flouted social distancing measures \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d. Demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, which have drawn elements of the far right, have been held in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. Trump said that some states are going too far with social distancing measures, but added that he did not believe stay-at-home orders should be dropped altogether. Asked to address a series of incendiary tweets which appeared to stoke protests against social restrictions in three states led by Democratic governors, he said he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with what he posted. Trump cast doubt on China\u2019s death toll, which was revised up on Friday, and said that \u201ca lot of strange things are happening\u201d regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. While the source of the virus is unknown, the broad scientific consensus is that it originated in bats. Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force members pushed back against criticism that limited testing ability is preventing the country from tackling the virus. A $19 billion relief program will help US farmers cope with the impact of the coronavirus. This includes $16 billion in direct payments to producers and mass purchases of meat, dairy, vegetables and other products. Japan, alarmed by rising coronavirus deaths, is scrambling to expand testing with drive-through facilities and general practitioners helping to collect samples. For weeks Japan has limited its testing for the coronavirus, despite calls from many health experts who see testing as vital to detecting and isolating cases and slowing the spread. Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in March, or just 16% of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University. Experts say Japan\u2019s strategy of keeping the number of PCR tests low has made it difficult to trace the disease as it spread in Tokyo and other big cities and led to a wave of in-hospital infections, crippling some facilities. Japan\u2019s total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK. In the US, Democratic lawmakers want police departments to be vigilant about any racially biased policing during the coronavirus pandemic, as people in communities of color express fears of being profiled while wearing masks or other face coverings in public. Senator Kamala Harris of California was among several senators to write to the Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray urging agencies to give anti-bias training to officers. With the ongoing public health emergency, it is more important than ever for law enforcement to build trust with communities of color, the senators said in the letter, which was first shared with The Associated Press. Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people who go out in public wear a surgical mask or a cloth covering their nose and mouth to prevent the spread of the virus. And already, some black men have reported incidents of racial profiling while following the recommendations. One World: Together at Home, a benefit concert curated by Lady Gaga, will be broadcast across the US television networks ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as being streamed online, at 8pm EST tonight. In the UK, BBC One will show an adapted version of the concert on 19 April. The concert is being held in support of the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 solidarity response fund and in celebration of health workers around the world. The lineup includes Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, Lizzo, J Balvin, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, Alanis Morissette, Burna Boy, Andrea Bocelli, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Elton John, John Legend, Kacey Musgraves, Keith Urban and Lang Lang. Walmart said on Friday it would hire 50,000 more workers at its stores, clubs and distribution centers to meet a surge in demand for groceries and household essentials from consumers stockpiling during the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. The retailer said it had reached its earlier target of hiring 150,000 workers six weeks ahead of schedule, taking in 5,000 people per day on average at a time when millions of Americans are losing their jobs amid unprecedented \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. Walmart said it had worked with more than 70 companies that furloughed workers due to the pandemic to hire its 150,000 new employees, many of whom came from the restaurant and hospitality industries. The majority of workers being hired are going into temporary or part-time roles. Skyrocketing demand for food, hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other household products has also prompted retailers Kroger, Target and Amazon to hire by the thousands. Hospitals in Japan are increasingly turning away sick people as the country struggles with surging coronavirus infections and its emergency medical system collapses, Associated Press has reported. In one recent case, an ambulance carrying a man with a fever and difficulty breathing was rejected by 80 hospitals and forced to search for hours for a hospital in downtown Tokyo that would treat him. Another feverish man finally reached a hospital after paramedics unsuccessfully contacted 40 clinics. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine say many hospital emergency rooms are refusing to treat people including those suffering strokes, heart attacks and external injuries. Japan initially seemed to have controlled the outbreak by going after clusters of infections in specific places, usually enclosed spaces such as clubs, gyms and meeting venues. But the spread of virus outpaced this approach and most new cases are untraceable. Apart from a general unwillingness to embrace social distancing, experts fault government incompetence and a widespread shortage of the protective gear and equipment medical workers need to do their jobs. Japan lacks enough hospital beds, medical workers or equipment. Forcing hospitalization of anyone with the virus, even those with mild symptoms, has left hospitals overcrowded and understaffed. Here is some further detail from Guatemala, where president Alejandro Giammattei has said that migrants who arrived in the country on Monday were infected with Covid-19. Giammattei said 12 randomly selected migrants who took the deportation flight from the US tested positive for coronavirus when examined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US health protection agency. He suggested more on the flight had tested positive for the virus. \u201cA large part of it was infected,\u201d the president said in a televised address. Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States were on Thursday once again temporarily suspended after reports of the mass infection. Deportation flights had only started again on Monday following a five-day suspension. An Argentine official has given some on-air sex education for onanistic lovers in the time of the coronavirus, Reuters has reported. Jose Barletta, a doctor with the country\u2019s health ministry, said in a televised broadcast that people needed to wash their hands after sex - whether it was in person or, as is increasingly the case, over digital channels. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever to wash your hands after having sexual relations, after masturbation, or virtual sex,\u201d Barletta said. \u201cIt is important to disinfect keyboards, telephones, sex toys and whatever else you might be using, whether or not you are sharing these things with others.\u201d The coronavirus lockdown has led to an increase in sales of sex toys in countries ranging from Denmark to Colombia. Argentina\u2019s lockdown began on March 20 and will run until at least April 26. The country has recorded 2,669 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far, 122 of them fatal. A report by the Bangkok Post today details the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on tourism in Thailand. The country is likely welcome only 16 million international tourists this year - far below the pre-coronavirus target of 40 million. The number of domestic trips is also down dramatically: from 172 million expected trips to 60 million, according to Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). Yuthasak Supasorn, TAT governor told the Bangkok Post: This revised forecast assumes tourism activities can resume in May, with the outbreak in Thailand levelling off while overseas infections subside...The industry needs to watch the situation closely before commencing business.\u201d Thailand has recorded 2,672 cases, with infections appearing to slow in recent weeks. Limited testing means the actual number of cases may be higher. The Kurdish-led administration in Syria\u2019s northeast has said that the World Health Organisation had found the area\u2019s first case of coronavirus earlier this month after samples were tested in Damascus, Reuters has reported. In a statement the regional administration said a 53-year-old man had died at Qamishli National Hospital on April 2 and that a sample sent to Damascus had tested positive for COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the coronavirus. But it said health authorities in the northeast, a region ruled autonomously from Damascus, had not been made aware of the results, which emerged on the same day as the patient\u2019s death. A WHO regional spokesperson said the positive test result was reported by the Syrian government health ministry on April 2, and that active surveillance was being carried out in northeast Syria to probe for other potential cases. \u201cContact tracing of the patient\u2019s close contacts was conducted, and all were reported negative. However, another family member is currently reportedly also in hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 with test results pending,\u201d said WHO spokesperson Inas Hamam. The Kurdish-led administration said it was \u201cdangerous\u201d that their health authorities had not been informed directly when the case was first confirmed. Guatemalan president, Alejandro Giammattei, says a large number of migrants on a US deportation flight to Guatemala on Monday were infected with the coronavirus, Reuters has reported. I\u2019ll bring you more information about this later. Transport Canada said on Friday that all airline passengers would be required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering during travel to curb the spread of coronavirus. The regulator said travellers must cover their mouth and nose during the boarding process and flights. The rule goes into effect at noon ET on Monday. Air Canada, the country\u2019s largest carrier, had previously recommended that customers wear a face-covering over their mouth and noses while onboard its flights. Mexico\u2019s president said on Friday that Trump has promised Mexico will be able to buy 1,000 ventilators and other intensive-therapy equipment used in treating severe cases of Covid-19. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called it a new gesture of solidarity with Mexico and said, \u201cI made the proposal that we could meet in June or July to personally express our appreciation.\u201d Such a visit would be unusual, especially if it implied the Mexican leader would travel to the United States. L\u00f3pez Obrador has eschewed trips abroad since he took office in December 2018. Mexico, which has releatively few ventilators, currently has 6,875 confirmed coronavirus cases and 546 deaths. At Friday\u2019s White House briefing, president Donald Trump defended his recent series of \u201cliberate\u201d tweets, which appeared to stoke protests against stay-at-home measures in three states led by Democratic governors. Asked to address the tweets, Trump said he is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with what he posted, and said that some states are going too far with social distancing measures. States are currently following federal guidelines encouraging Americans to stay home. Protestors who gathered around the country and flouted distancing measures, Trump said, \u201cseem to be very responsible people\u201d. Also during the briefing, Dr Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, said the US will need to conduct at least 4.5m tests a month before its safe to move into Phase 1 of the administration\u2019s Opening Up America Again plan. The president was less measured in his assessment, insisting that many states were ready to reopen, despite a lack of testing and evidence that the number of cases are decreasing. At a meeting on Friday, China\u2019s politburo said that the government must pursue comprehensive reopening of China\u2019s economy while take steps to restrict the spread of coronavirus, it was reported by China\u2019s state-run Global Times this morning. The meeting also said government spending should be increased and the central bank should cut market loan rates to support business. This follow\u2019s reports yesterday that China\u2019s economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020, the country\u2019s first such contraction on record and a stark sign of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. You can read a full report here by Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief. China has reported that on Friday 27 new coronavirus cases were confirmed, of which 17 were linked to foreign travel. No new fatalities were recorded. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you the latest global coronavirus updates. China will push ahead with reopening its economy, state media reported on Saturday morning, just one day after it emerged the country\u2019s economy had shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020, the country\u2019s first such contraction on record. Here are the latest developments from elsewhere around the world: Trump defended a series of incendiary \u201cliberate\u201d tweets which appeared to stoke protests against physical distancing measures, saying he is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with what he posted. An unprecedented US policy that uses the pandemic as grounds to summarily expel people who have migrated to or sought asylum in the country violates international law, the United Nations has warned Chile will become the first country to issue \u201cimmunity cards\u201d to those who have recovered from Covid-19, exempting holders from quarantine so that they can return to work. The death toll in France has exceeded 18,000. According to the most recent official data, 18,681 people have now died in France; an increase of 761 in 24 hours. A further 847 people have died in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. Capt Tom Moore, the British second world war veteran who sought sponsorship to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has now raised more than \u00a320m for National Health Service charities. Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded abroad. This compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak. Germany has declared its coronavirus outbreak under control as it prepares to take its first tentative steps out of lockdown next week.
