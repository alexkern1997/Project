Adults and children are having psychotic episodes, mania and depression, with some taken to hospital because of the heavy toll on their mental wellbeing. Men aged 18-25 are reported to have been badly affected by first-time mental health issues. Previous research has suggested they feel the worst affected by restrictions on their movement, and are most likely to flout the lockdown. Eight weeks into lockdown measures, the Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning that services could be overwhelmed by “a tsunami of mental illness”. A survey it undertook of psychiatrists across the UK revealed that families were experiencing significant tension as a result of staying at home together all the time. Four in 10 psychiatrists report an increase in people needing urgent and emergency mental healthcare – including new patients – in the wake of the lockdown. Dr Kate Lovett, dean of the royal college, said: “During the pandemic, people are presenting for the first time with symptoms of serious mood disorders, such as mania, significant depression, and psychotic episodes. These have been triggered by significant stress and life events associated with the pandemic and the lockdown. “I and other colleagues have seen people presenting for the first time in emergency situations, often triggered by significant life events such as losing a job, a bereavement, significant illness in a family member or concerns that their business, or the one they work for, is about to go under.” Lovett, a community psychiatrist in Devon, added: “Of the people I am seeing, many are extremely unwell with symptoms of severe mental illness: serious changes in their moods, belief system and hallucinations.

People not working is also an issue. “One woman rang us recently and said her partner was walking around their house like a zombie because he wasn’t working and couldn’t provide for the family and had just snapped.” Psychiatrists are also concerned about stress linked to the fear of contracting Covid-19. Being cut off from family and friends, and disruption to normal NHS services, are also exacerbating existing mental health problems. Some now refer to the emergence of “lockdown anxiety”. One mental health nurse said that she and her colleagues were seeing people with a set of symptoms they had christened “corona-psychosis”. Such patients have typically lost their job and are having trouble sleeping, becoming anxious from watching the news on TV and no longer getting social support through their normal networks. The royal college’s findings are contained in a survey of 1,369 psychiatrists carried out between 1 and 6 May. In it 45% of psychiatrists said that they had seen a fall in the number of patients attending routine appointments during the pandemic, which could see services facing a “tsunami” of people needing treatment once restrictions on people’s movements have eased. One participant said: “Many of our patients have deteriorated or developed mental disorders as a direct result of the coronavirus disruption, for example social isolation, increased stress [or that they have] run out of meds.” The findings follow the UN’s warning this week that the pandemic could lead to an “upsurge” in the number of people needing mental health care and the severity of their illness. Earlier this month, Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s national clinical director for mental health, told the Commons health and social care committee that demand for mental healthcare would increase “significantly” once the lockdown ended and would see people needing treatment for trauma for years to come, just as they did after the Grenfell fire in London in 2017. Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder was likely in people who had lost a relative to Covid-19 or been in intensive care, she added. One psychiatrist told the college that “lockdown has exacerbated behavioural difficulties in children” and another that they had seen “patients having severe psychotic symptoms which incorporate Covid-related themes”. A specialist in the psychiatric care of children and young people said they had seen more under-18s with autism having to be admitted for inpatient care because they were “not coping with changes re Covid” and others “with deteriorating mental health state and increase in significant self-harm and increase in completed suicides”. An NHS spokesperson said: “Although there can of course be no reliable data as yet on any medium- or long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health, the NHS has been adapting our services to ensure people can still get care like talking therapy or counselling with their clinician, even while still adhering to government guidance.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

However, the risk posed by handling a polymer note is no greater than touching any other common surfaces such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards.” Earlier this month <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/02/exclusive-dirty-banknotes-may-spreading-coronavirus-world-health/?mod=article_inline"" title="""">a newspaper report</a> claimed the World Health Organization (WHO) had said banknotes may be spreading the coronavirus, so people should try to use contactless payments instead. But it was then reported that the WHO <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-we-did-not-say-that-cash-was-transmitting-coronavirus-2020-03-06"" title="""">denied it had said cash was transmitting the coronavirus</a>, and that it had been “misrepresented” – so go figure.</p> <p>However, logic would suggest that most notes and coins will have previously been handled by large numbers of people (though ATMs quite often dispense notes that are either brand new or little used), so if you are worried, paying with a contactless card where possible is probably the way to go.</p> <h2><strong>How can I stay safe when out shopping, particularly in supermarkets?</strong></h2> <p>Photographs of lengthy queues of supermarket shoppers in Italy – with people adhering to the new “social distancing” rule for public places requiring that they ensure they are 1 metre apart – have been viewed with alarm in the UK.

With the fuzzy logic and stern will of a sleep-deprived woman, I gave chase to the thief: a fox. It was as astonished as I was, to find itself in an unseemly tussle over what it now considered to be its bag. This element of surprise was the only reason I caught up with it, because it was a faster mover than me. We tugged the bag to and fro, the fox getting ever more furious that anyone would deny it such a prize (at the time I couldn’t understand why, but I later found a handful of almonds and half a chocolate bar at the bottom of the bag). It all happened very quickly, but when it wasn’t getting its way, the fox bit me: a good, sharp nip on the ankle. In doing so, it gave up the struggle and I raced back to the tent clutching the bag. Although Fatima later declared she’d rushed to my aid, she had the presence of mind to grab a phone and take two rather blurry photographs of the scene. No one else stirred – all we could hear was Dom snoring nearby. We got back into our tent, with the shredded bag, and zipped ourselves in. I thought the ordeal was over, but suddenly the fox returned, launching some very impressive four-footed attacks on the canvas. They were forceful and vicious, like the footage you see of a fox jumping through snow to get at its prey. With no joy, and no bag, it eventually gave up and went on its way. Later that morning, I was sent to get medical attention. The chances of contracting rabies from a rabid fox are not zero. But because the walk couldn’t stop, I had to have jabs at hospitals in three different countries. In Bulgaria, a grizzled, ancient doctor attended to me with much laughter, telling me the good news that “at least it wasn’t a bear”. He located the dainty, double puncture wound above my left ankle, simply applied iodine and a plaster, and sent me onwards to Plovdiv, the last city before we crossed the Turkish border. There, more iodine was administered and a different doctor laughed that “at least it wasn’t a bear”. I got my first rabies jab, and the doctor wrote a schedule of follow-up jabs for me and put in Latin vulnus morsum cruris sinistra (the bite wound left leg), to help explain it when I got to Turkey. Three days later, I presented it and myself at an Istanbul hospital A&amp;E. I had a companion who spoke no Turkish, Bulgarian paperwork, Latin instructions, and Google Translate. The doctor dismissed all of these with a wave of her hand, gave me another jab and ordered me to return a few days later. This time I was alone but, through the power of mime and pointing, I was in and out in eight minutes. My last jab was administered in a near-empty hospital on the outskirts of Dublin, long before coronavirus had reached Ireland. I had no side-effects from the bite or the jabs, and was able to complete the walk, so I can rest happy in the knowledge that there is a fox in Bulgaria with a little bit of Irish in it. • Do you have an experience to share?

Edward Argar said the test developed by Roche “appears to be extremely reliable and it’s got the green light from Public Health England testers”. He said the government wanted to get the test on stream quickly because it could make a significant difference. However, he acknowledged that no tests had been purchased by the UK as the government was still in discussions with Roche about acquiring them. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Argar said: “We are keen to get as many as we can and get them out primarily to the front line on stream and out more widely, because as the prime minister says it has the potential to be a game changer.” He could not give a date when they would be available for the NHS and then wider use by the public. But he said they would make a big difference, as scientific evidence indicated the presence of antibodies could provide a degree of immunity. He said this could “genuinely change how you can work” because people could be confident that they could no longer get coronavirus or transmit it to others. Antibody testing could be of great benefit as the country emerges from lockdown because the presence of antibodies to the virus in the blood proves who has had it. However, whether a person is immune, and if so how long that immunity lasts, are still uncertain. The test is likely to be used to find out whether particular areas of the country, or people in certain professions, have had Covid-19, but it will not yet give individuals an immunity passport to let them restart their social lives. This Roche antibody test is not the home finger-prick test that created a wave of excitement when Prof Sharon Peacock from Public Health England told a committee of MPs on 25 March it would be available to buy within days. Oxford University was testing several versions of the home antibody tests, which look like pregnancy tests, at the time. All, however, failed to come up to standard. The best were said to have been 70% accurate and most no more than 50%. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who had bought 3m of them, was said to be seeking the government’s money back. Roche’s test was approved at the start of May by the EU and by the Food and Drug Administration in the US as being 99.8% specific for Covid-19 – so it is not confused by antibodies against other coronaviruses which cause colds – and 100% sensitive, so it will pick up any antibodies that are present. It will work on blood samples taken by a healthcare professional at least 14 days after a person develops Covid-19. The Elecsys Anti-Sars-CoV-2 serology test is processed in laboratories using Roche analysers that hospitals already have. Roche says its fully automated systems can provide results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a capability to do 300 tests an hour, depending on the analyser. Prof John Newton, the national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, told the Telegraph experts at PHE’s Porton Down labs had evaluated the test and confirmed the 100% accuracy. “This is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection,” he said. “This in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear.” Scientists hope to obtain valuable data on the spread of the pandemic through mass antibody testing, which could reveal how many people have had the virus but without experiencing any symptoms.

Dr Tsai Ing-wen secured a second term with a landslide win in January, a rebuke of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to isolate the island, which it claims as its own and vows it will be brought under control by force if necessary. Pompeo said Tsai’s “courage and vision in leading Taiwan’s vibrant democracy [was] an inspiration to the region and the world”, in remarks Taiwan described as the first delivered to a Taiwanese president by a US secretary of state. China’s foreign ministry said Pompeo’s act had severely damaged peace and stability in the strait between Taiwan and China. It warned it would take “necessary countermeasures” and the US would have to bear the consequences, but did not elaborate. Tsai said in her inauguration address that celebrated the self-governing island’s successful fight against coronavirus that Taiwan would not accept attempts by China to “downgrade” its status and pledged to stand up to pressure from Beijing. She said both sides must find a way to coexist. “We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation, we have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy.

Beijing also responded swiftly to Tsai’s speech and said China would never leave any room for “Taiwan independence separatist activities”. Her remarks come as China prepares to host a key political event this week and after an international campaign to restore Taiwan’s status as an observer to the world health assembly (WHA), which Beijing has blocked since 2016. Shortly before Monday’s WHA meeting, Taiwan’s foreign minister announced, with “deep regret and strong dissatisfaction”, that its bid would be put on ice for now.

There have been no new confirmed cases in almost three weeks. In recent months, there has been an apparent increase in provocative action by Chinese forces in the seas separating the two regions, including sending military flotillas and flybys towards Taiwan, and some calls for “reunification by force” from Beijing. While analysts believe an invasion is not likely, Chinese state media have been quick to point out China’s military might. “What ultimately determines the direction of the situation across the Taiwan Strait is a contest of strength,” said an editorial from the state-run Global Times, published immediately after Tsai’s speech. Tsai had called on the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to help “prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences”. China’s Taiwan affairs office said Beijing would continue “to work together with people from both sides to deepen development”, but would never tolerate any act separating Taiwan from China, or leave any room for any forms of independence. Spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said reunification was “the natural trend of history”, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Tsai’s speech had also pledged growth and changes in Taiwan. Several of her plans appeared to directly challenge China’s global interests, including a pledge to develop a cybersecurity industry integrated with the global 5G transformation.

Dr Tsai Ing-wen secured a second term with a landslide win in January, a rebuke of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to isolate the island, which it claims as its own and vows it will be brought under control by force if necessary. Pompeo said Tsai’s “courage and vision in leading Taiwan’s vibrant democracy [was] an inspiration to the region and the world”, in remarks Taiwan described as the first delivered to a Taiwanese president by a US secretary of state. China’s foreign ministry said Pompeo’s act had severely damaged peace and stability in the strait between Taiwan and China. It warned it would take “necessary countermeasures” and the US would have to bear the consequences, but did not elaborate. Tsai said in her inauguration address that celebrated the self-governing island’s successful fight against coronavirus that Taiwan would not accept attempts by China to “downgrade” its status and pledged to stand up to pressure from Beijing. She said both sides must find a way to coexist. “We have resisted the pressure of aggression and annexation, we have made the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Although we were once isolated in the world, we have always persisted in values of democracy and freedom no matter the challenges ahead of us. “We will not accept the Beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country, two systems’ to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo,” she said, referring to the framework under which the troubled region of Hong Kong is governed. Beijing also responded swiftly to Tsai’s speech and said China would never leave any room for “Taiwan independence separatist activities”. Her remarks come as China prepares to host a key political event this week and after an international campaign to restore Taiwan’s status as an observer to the world health assembly (WHA), which Beijing has blocked since 2016. Shortly before Monday’s WHA meeting, Taiwan’s foreign minister announced, with “deep regret and strong dissatisfaction”, that its bid would be put on ice for now. Beijing is facing growing international criticism over Covid-19, which emerged in China late last year. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s global standing has been boosted by its response to the pandemic, which has been praised as effective without encroaching on its citizens’ civil liberties. Taiwan responded quickly to the outbreak, monitoring and screening incoming travellers from as early as 31 December, enacting travel restrictions, mandatory quarantine testing and phone tracking. It also banned the export of face masks to ensure domestic supply. After testing nearly 70,000 people, it has confirmed 440 cases of the virus, of which seven were fatal. There have been no new confirmed cases in almost three weeks. In recent months, there has been an apparent increase in provocative action by Chinese forces in the seas separating the two regions, including sending military flotillas and flybys towards Taiwan, and some calls for “reunification by force” from Beijing. While analysts believe an invasion is not likely, Chinese state media have been quick to point out China’s military might. “What ultimately determines the direction of the situation across the Taiwan Strait is a contest of strength,” said an editorial from the state-run Global Times, published immediately after Tsai’s speech. Tsai had called on the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to help “prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences”. China’s Taiwan affairs office said Beijing would continue “to work together with people from both sides to deepen development”, but would never tolerate any act separating Taiwan from China, or leave any room for any forms of independence. Spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said reunification was “the natural trend of history”, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Tsai’s speech had also pledged growth and changes in Taiwan. Several of her plans appeared to directly challenge China’s global interests, including a pledge to develop a cybersecurity industry integrated with the global 5G transformation. China’s Huawei technology company has come up against resistance and outright bans from some countries’ 5G networks because of security concerns. “We will strive to create a cybersecurity system and industrial chain which can protect our country and earn the world’s trust,” she said. Tsai noted the amount of attention Taiwan had received over recent months, and thanked citizens for their efforts in responding to the outbreak. She said the island’s work during the pandemic had “changed the way the international community views Taiwan”, which presented both opportunities and challenges. “You have shown the world Taiwan’s commitment to civic virtues, even in times of greatest distress … This is is what solidarity feels like,” she said. “It takes more than fervour to govern a country.” China’s state-run Global Times quickly issued an editorial, accusing Pompeo of congratulating Tsai to deliberately challenge Beijing. “The US and Taiwan want to play petty tricks at a low cost, which is too naive.

A 35-year-old male retail worker in Thailand died from Covid-19, according to the country’s department of disease control on Sunday. The man had also tested positive for dengue fever. In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in a hospital in Western Australia. His wife has also contracted the virus. On Saturday, US officials said a man in his 50s in Washington state had died, after being tested for the disease on Thursday. Authorities said they did not know how he had contracted the virus because he did not have any history of travel to affected areas or contact with known Covid-19 cases. On Sunday, China reported its sharpest increase in new infections in a week with 573 new cases, the highest daily rise in a week. Chinese health authorities reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day’s toll of 47. A 32-year-old doctor named Zhong Jinxing in the southern province of Guangxi reportedly died from “overwork” on Friday after working for 33 consecutive days. Another doctor, Jiang Xueqing, 55, died on Sunday after having been infected with Covid-19, according to Chinese state media. An estimated 87,000 people globally have contracted the virus, with cases in at least 59 countries. On Sunday, Armenia reported its first case, while Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg and Ireland were among those reporting initial infections over the weekend. South Korea, the worst-hit country after China, confirmed 376 new cases on Sunday, bringing the number of infections to more than 3,500. Churches were closed, with many holding online services as authorities warned residents to stay indoors during this “critical moment”. Japan reported its second death. A man in his 70s in the northernmost island of Hokkaido died on Saturday night after testing positive for Covid-19. Japan has said it plans to go ahead with the Tokyi Olympics scheduled for July and August. “I have decided we must make all efforts in the next one or two weeks to prevent the spread,” the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said in a press conference on Saturday. As the World Health Organization raised the global risk level from the coronavirus to “very high”, countries have expanded travel restrictions and preventive measures. France, which has recorded at least 100 coronavirus cases, has temporarily banned public gatherings of more than 5,000 people while Switzerland said it will bar events of more than 1,000. American Airlines said it would suspend all flights to Milan, Italy, after the US raised travel warnings for parts of the country. Italy, home to at least 1,100 cases, has been the hardest hit European country, reporting 29 deaths caused by the virus.

    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>
    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>
     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>
     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>
     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>
     <li>Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>
    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>

Clubs and stakeholders have since held regular meetings in an attempt to find a solution and will do so again on Friday to discuss the latest plans, which are thought to involve restarting games on the weekend of 13 June – subject to government approval.</p> <h2><strong>How will the Premier League’s plan work?</strong></h2> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/premier-league-clubs-fear-becoming-scapegoats-if-game-returns-too-soon"">Premier League clubs fear becoming scapegoats if game returns too soon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shareholders’ meeting will hear more details on a proposal that was first raised by the Premier League at its last summit, on 17 April. That would involve all 92 remaining matches being played over a six-week period at “approved stadiums” in what has been described as a “festival of football”. Some of the games would potentially be shown on terrestrial television, while a three-week pre-season has also been proposed to allow players time to prepare. Players from Arsenal, Brighton, West Ham and Tottenham have already returned to their respective training grounds, albeit observing strict social distancing guidelines.</p> <h2><strong>Will it be safe?</strong></h2> <p>Everything will depend on clubs being able to create a “return to play” protocol that is approved by the government and its heath advisers. That is thought to include plans for players and officials being placed in lockdown at nominated hotels for up to six weeks.

Clubs and stakeholders have since held regular meetings in an attempt to find a solution and will do so again on Friday to discuss the latest plans, which are thought to involve restarting games on the weekend of 13 June – subject to government approval. How will the Premier League’s plan work? The shareholders’ meeting will hear more details on a proposal that was first raised by the Premier League at its last summit, on 17 April. That would involve all 92 remaining matches being played over a six-week period at “approved stadiums” in what has been described as a “festival of football”. Some of the games would potentially be shown on terrestrial television, while a three-week pre-season has also been proposed to allow players time to prepare. Players from Arsenal, Brighton, West Ham and Tottenham have already returned to their respective training grounds, albeit observing strict social distancing guidelines. Will it be safe?

Of course it will. Matt Hancock has said we will do 100,000 tests each day by the end of April, but Britain still doesn’t have a way to control the virus that goes beyond lockdown. Without a proper programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, we won’t stop the spread of coronavirus. As patients pour into hospitals again, a series of national lockdowns will follow. It’s a pattern that could go on for years – until we have a vaccine. The problem with Hancock’s plan is that testing alone won’t break the chain of community transmission. To stop the spread of a virus, tests must be linked to community surveillance and contact tracing. This ensures that people who have the virus, and people they have come into contact with, can be identified quickly and quarantined at home to prevent the virus spreading. The government’s tests will measure how many people have had the virus, and will show whether health workers are immune – but without community surveillance, tests alone won’t prevent its spread. On 12 March, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that the UK had moved from containing the virus to delaying its spread. Their plan was to flatten the curve of the epidemic that would sweep through our population. They reassured us that herd immunity would kick in once 60% of the population had been infected. Social distancing and washing our hands would ease the pressure on health services, they said. Crucially, community testing and contract tracing would stop immediately. At that point, we were still four weeks behind Italy. The media felt safe, reassured by two eminent physicians. The trouble is, those scientists were wrong. The maths wasn’t difficult: working off their figures, about 40 million people in the UK would be infected by coronavirus, and between 200,000 and 400,000 would eventually die. When the government’s mathematicians modelled figures from Italy and showed that 30% of people admitted to hospital ended up in intensive care, they warned the government that the NHS would be overwhelmed. The government backtracked within three days, and shifted to suppressing rather than mitigating the virus. In reality, little changed. The government’s beliefs were founded on the assumption that coronavirus behaves like flu. It doesn’t. Its mortality rate is higher, there is little evidence that it is seasonal, and it poses a far greater threat to the NHS. Without a programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, the virus will continue to spread. Britain will be subject to routine flare-ups and repeated lockdowns. I spoke to a senior international epidemic expert, who wished to remain anonymous. They described the UK’s response as too weak. “Finding these viruses is like guerrilla warfare. If you don’t know where the virus is hiding you cannot control it. We must use a bundle of measures to chase it. We must organise teams of friendly community workers to find people with symptoms, test for the virus, isolate and treat them, and trace their contacts. Workers must check on them in their homes every one or two days,” they said. I asked them whether social distancing alone could beat the virus. “It won’t work,” they told me. “You can stop contact tracing in the hotspots, but when you lift the lockdown, everywhere at the same time, you’ll face a problem: the virus will come back. New hotspots will form. “Without a community programme for case detection and contact tracing, you won’t find the virus until it’s too late.” In China, Xi Jinping initially prevaricated, suppressing the findings of a fact-finding mission on 4 January that investigated the outbreak in Wuhan. But by 26 January, China had placed more than 50 million people under quarantine; 40 provinces reported a total of 2,744 cases and 80 deaths. The Chinese communist party mobilised thousands of community workers to scale up a national testing effort, while mapping infections using case definitions based on symptoms. Almost 40,000 health workers were flown in from across China to help with this huge community surveillance effort. The government enforced regional lockdowns, closed down shops, bars, universities and schools, and policed the supermarkets and pharmacies. They developed apps to monitor peoples’ symptoms and their compliance with quarantine, and set up 24-hour TV channels in every province to update people on data, progress and prevention. With this comprehensive response, China managed to suppress the transmission of the virus in less than two months. By contrast, the UK was slow to act, and timid when it did. The government mistakenly based its coronavirus response on social distancing alone. The UK’s Scientific Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) didn’t even ask their mathematical advisers to model a community testing programme. Neil Ferguson reportedly said community testing and contact tracing wasn’t included as a possible strategy in the original modelling because not enough tests were available. But we had eight weeks’ notice. We still don’t have a coordinated mobilisation of general practices and public health outbreak management teams. None are linked with digital apps or laboratory testing. In one of the best research cultures in the world, we failed to create the community surveillance and testing effort needed to stop the spread of the virus. The government and its advisers are now committed to their strategy of delaying the spread of coronavirus, which they hope will eventually lead to herd immunity. Our present predicament is a symptom of past decisions: the decision not to roll out testing sooner put the government on the back foot, scrambling to catch up with the virus. But it isn’t too late. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, we need a change of direction. Local authorities must take control of their public-health outbreak management teams. We need a centralised app and database to allow citizens to report their symptoms, such as the NHSX app that researchers have been working on since January. GP networks, working with teams of trained volunteers and retired health workers equipped with personal protective equipment, could visit everyone reporting suspicious symptoms at home every one to two days. If there is testing, all the better. But symptom-based reporting will do. With a proper community protection scheme in place, local authorities could shield their population from the threat of the virus, which has taken hold in hotspots like London and the cities of the Midlands and north west. The lockdown will flatten the curve, but we have a month or more before it lifts. This gives us time. To prevent the virus spreading to less affected areas, we have a choice: a dramatic change of direction, or praying that vaccinologists can work miracles. • Anthony Costello is professor of global health at UCL, and former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organization",7014,false,false,"<a href=""profile/anthony-costello"">Anthony Costello</a>",2020-04-03T17:45:00Z,,,,,,,,2020-04-03,2020-04-02 00:00:00+00:00,0

Or to be specific, it needs your phone. The new NHS coronavirus tracing app is to be trialled from this week on the Isle of Wight and ministers are pushing it with all the fervent appeal to moral duty they can muster. Since it’s being sold as the nearest thing to a safe way out of this nightmare, unsurprisingly early surveys suggest most islanders are willing at least to try something that promises to alert them when they’ve been in contact with other app users who later show symptoms of Covid-19. Throughout this epidemic the British have proved more willing than anyone imagined to do whatever’s asked of them, to protect the NHS or their own loved ones. But can it really be that simple? The good news is that new mathematical modelling from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) suggests mass “test and trace” strategies – variations on the theme of identifying cases quickly, working out who they’ve been around and getting those people to self-isolate before they unwittingly spread the virus – could cut transmission rates by 50-65%, compared to just 2-30% for mass testing or self-isolation alone. In other words, it beats the pre-lockdown strategy of getting people to stay at home only once they start coughing or showing a temperature. The bad news, however, is that the researchers also suggest tracing apps may not by themselves be enough to contain the virus. The paper hasn’t yet been peer reviewed so shouldn’t be treated as gospel but under its model, keeping the rate of transmission (or the R rate) anywhere near the magic number of one, even with a tracing app, might still mean people restricting themselves to fewer than 10 contacts a day. That’s not so much a return to life as we knew it, as one measly bus journey plus a couple of close encounters with joggers in the park; mass home working and social restrictions would probably still be necessary. And then there’s the single biggest hurdle to adopting the app for the long term, which isn’t the threat to privacy (valid as that may be) so much as old-fashioned human irritation and inconvenience. The one thing likely to get people deleting the app is being told to stay home for what feels like no good reason. It’s no good if, say, an alert goes off every time you’re washing up in the kitchen and someone walks past on the street outside. So instead of blindly pinging alerts to any user coming within six feet of a potentially infected person, the NHS app will use clinically informed algorithms to work out which encounters are actually risky, teaching itself as it goes. The bonus is that the trial could give doctors critical insights into how the virus is still spreading even under lockdown, or which patterns of behaviour are risky. The snag is that means collecting data centrally, which isn’t the way Apple and Google want the app to work on their devices. To cut a long technical story short, the fear is that the resulting compromise might be a battery hog, draining mobiles annoyingly fast. The “test, track and trace” mantra also stops intriguingly short of what happens if people refuse to self-isolate on receiving an alert.

It was reminiscent of another government minister explaining how they were “following the scientific advice” when confronted with some awkward questions about past shortcomings.

Cases have been reported in the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>However the World Health Organization’s emergency committee said on Thursday that it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said: “Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.</p> \n<p>“I wish to reiterate, the fact that I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”</p> \n<p>Referring to the Scottish cases, Prof Jürgen Haas, the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said he believed there would be many more in other parts of the UK.</p> \n<p>The Scottish patients all travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown"">thought to have originated</a>, within the past two weeks and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble – a red flag for the virus.</p> \n<p>A Scottish government spokesman said: “Following travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only.

Fourteen people were tested for the virus, with five confirmed negative and nine still awaiting results, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday night. The Scottish government had earlier confirmed that five people were being examined after presenting with symptoms of the illness, while it was understood that another patient was being tested at Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital. PHE would not give a breakdown of where the people were tested and where the negative results were recorded. Downing Street said four of the suspected cases in Scotland were believed to involve Chinese nationals. Around the world, so far the disease has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Cases have been reported in the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. However the World Health Organization’s emergency committee said on Thursday that it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the outbreak. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said: “Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. “I wish to reiterate, the fact that I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.” Referring to the Scottish cases, Prof Jürgen Haas, the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said he believed there would be many more in other parts of the UK. The Scottish patients all travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble – a red flag for the virus. A Scottish government spokesman said: “Following travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. Three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis.” Haas said there were “robust arrangements” in place to manage emerging diseases and they were monitoring the situation closely. He said the cases emerged overnight, adding: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students. It’s not too surprising. My suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK.” Haas said there was only one laboratory testing for the virus, operated by Public Health England, and that the cases had been flagged up through the PHE infection guidelines as the patients had travelled to Wuhan within the last 14 days and were showing signs of respiratory symptoms. Universities with links to China have issued warnings to staff and students travelling to and from areas affected by the coronavirus. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, where the outbreak began. Earlier in the day, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs there was an increased likelihood that the coronavirus would arrive in the UK, but said the authorities were well prepared and would remain vigilant. Hancock told the Commons that the UK was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly. However, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days, and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected. The UK has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, where all the deaths so far have occurred and which is now under lockdown by the Chinese authorities. While the UK has put in place measures to check passengers at Heathrow airport arriving from Wuhan, the Chinese government has stopped flights out of the city. “The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,” Hancock told MPs.

    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>
    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>
     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>
    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>

He said the cases emerged overnight, adding: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students. It’s not too surprising. My suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK.” Haas said there was only one laboratory testing for the virus, operated by Public Health England, and that the cases had been flagged up through the PHE infection guidelines as the patients had travelled to Wuhan within the last 14 days and were showing signs of respiratory symptoms. Universities with links to China have issued warnings to staff and students travelling to and from areas affected by the coronavirus. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, where the outbreak began. Earlier in the day, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs there was an increased likelihood that the coronavirus would arrive in the UK, but said the authorities were well prepared and would remain vigilant. Hancock told the Commons that the UK was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly. However, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days, and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected. The UK has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, where all the deaths so far have occurred and which is now under lockdown by the Chinese authorities. While the UK has put in place measures to check passengers at Heathrow airport arriving from Wuhan, the Chinese government has stopped flights out of the city. “The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,” Hancock told MPs. Some people arriving on the last flight from Wuhan on Wednesday said they had not received any health checks at Heathrow, MPs pointed out. Handing out information was the key thing, Hancock replied. “The most important part of the monitoring is to ensure everybody knows what to do if the symptoms arise.” Several MPs said there were substantial numbers of Chinese students at universities in their constituencies. There was no specific advice for students, other than the general advice, Hancock said. “I’m very happy to take away the point that we will ensure we are communicating through Universities UK with all universities, to make sure the message gets to all students directly and they hear the advice that is there for everybody.” The Labour MP Hilary Benn asked what advice would be given to the public about the use of face masks, which they would see being used in China and elsewhere on the television. “People look at what people are doing in countries where the disease has taken hold and ask the authorities, ‘Why aren’t we doing the same?’” said Benn. Hancock replied: “The wearing of face masks is not deemed clinically necessary now, but we will keep that under review and will be guided by the science.”",5572,false,false,"<a href=""profile/sarahboseley"">Sarah Boseley</a> Health editor and agencies",,,1,2020-01-24T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-01-23,2020-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,0

Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College explained that with reference to the Liverpool v Atlético Madrid match played on 11 March. “Some people will have got infected,” he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, “and if it hadn’t happened they wouldn’t have been.” But he went on to explain that “at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact”. But in normal circumstances we do not think of a risk to some lives as “marginal” because they are not many as a proportion of the whole population; normally everything is aimed at saving and preserving life. Most of the talk in football now is about how players and staff could be tested, somehow housed in a sterile environment, how they might ingeniously be tiptoed into empty stadiums while the rest of the population are still largely housebound. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was criticised by the club itself for raising public health concerns about games restarting, but however in-depth the planning may be to avoid people massing outside the stadium or gathering instinctively to celebrate, he was sounding a genuine alarm about risks. To be balanced against those lethal hazards are the benefits of trying so hard to stage matches again. As seven weeks have gone by since football suspended itself on 13 March, against the advice of Dowden and his government that it was fine to carry on into that weekend, the significance of promotion, relegation and Champions League qualification has been put into perspective by the pandemic’s elemental threat. Now the urge to play is articulated more as a grim job of having to get the season done to avoid difficult conversations with broadcasters, and be able to keep their money. After Dowden spoke up in parliament, more than one senior football executive told the Guardian this week they felt uneasy, as if the government needs some good news, some entertainment for the masses, and that lies behind their desire to get the Premier League playing “as soon as possible”. Dowden said in parliament that this would “help release resources through the rest of the system”, but the EFL is understood to be baffled by that, as no more money will go down the football pyramid now if the Premier League starts playing again. In France, where the number of people killed by Covid-19 is lower than in Britain, the government has banned team sports until September and, however much the odd club such as Lyon may grumble, Ligue 1 is cancelled, and the summer is cleared of yet another complication, to try to address the virus. If that were to happen here, however much football people are missing the game and would love current realities to be different, many people could usefully calm down. The financial situation, of course difficult, will probably be just about manageable. If that did happen, the Premier League could concentrate on being true to the principle it has stressed throughout and did again on Friday: “The thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” and: “The Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.”",5184,false,false,"<a href=""profile/davidconn"">David Conn</a>",,,56,2020-05-02T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-05-01,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

The company is considering making as many as 8,000 of its 52,000 global workforce redundant, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. The coronavirus crisis has severely affected Rolls-Royce’s business, because aircraft manufacturers have cut production rates and air traffic has plummeted, dealing a huge blow to its units servicing jet engines. About 4,000 UK workers have been furloughed, the company said on Thursday before its virtual annual meeting, meaning the government was paying 80% of the wages of about a quarter of the company’s UK workforce.

Hours fell by 90% in April, resulting in a “significant reduction in the volume of service visits”. East also said that the company was making “stronger than expected progress” in cutting costs, allowing it to save £1bn this year. The firm has also made some progress in returning the troubled Trent 1000 engine to full working order.

As pressure mounts on the government to restore business and consumer confidence, the Resolution Foundation said a new work subsidy modelled on maternity pay should be available for workers threatened with redundancy. The statutory retention pay would allow firms to put staff on leave without making them redundant, supporting a million workers via a flat-rate subsidy to employers worth £151 per week for an initial six months. The statutory pay retention scheme would cost around £3.6bn, the thinktank said, while a more ambitious earnings-linked scheme, in which staff are paid at least two-thirds of their typical salary – above the minimum £151 per week threshold – would cost around £8bn over six months. The Citizens Advice Bureau proposed an alternative “crisis minimum income” of at least £180 a week so everyone has enough money “to protect their own health and the health of others”. Adding to criticism that ministers have moved slowly to protect vulnerable workers from dramatic falls in income, the Conservative former business secretary Greg Clark joined the Labour former prime minister Gordon Brown in urging the government to act immediately to prevent mass job losses by allowing the taxpayer to subsidise companies’ wage bills. Meanwhile, 46 opposition MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak demanding “a basic income payment for all citizens to see them through this crisis”. Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Germany are among the European countries that have already taken action to directly shore up workers’ incomes. Clark, who resigned as business secretary rather than serve under Johnson, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons warning the government that the £330bn loan scheme announced by Sunak as chancellor on Tuesday would not prevent firms from laying-off their staff. “These businesses have no idea when they would be able to pay back the debt that they would incur. It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said. Brown said Sunak must do “considerably more” by the weekend to protect people’s jobs. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “He says he’ll do more but the package should be out now to avoid redundancies being forced upon companies over the next day or two. Sunak announced an expansion of statutory sick pay in the budget on 11 March and a relaxation of benefit rules designed to help vulnerable workers. He has not ruled out adopting a broader package of income support but has said the mechanisms used by other European countries do not exist in the UK. As part of the package announced on Tuesday, the chancellor offered businesses in the hard-hit retail, leisure and hospitality sectors a year-long holiday from paying business rates, with smaller firms also eligible for a cash grant of up to £25,000. Sunak also announced cash grants of £10,000 for the UK’s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments for homeowners in difficulty due to the coronavirus. With the scale of the coronavirus pandemic – and the public health response to it – having escalated since the budget last week, the Resolution Foundation said the chancellor must “step up the scale of support for affected workers and rethink the approach to helping struggling firms”. The thinktank’s report says around 5 million workers are vulnerable to being laid off unless the government goes further. Without giving a forecast for the likely rise in unemployment, the report estimates in its modelling of the potential costs that between 500,000 and 1 million workers could be laid off. It says fewer than one in 10 of those in the bottom half of earners say they can work from home, and those in the most at-risk sectors and occupations also have less to fall back on given that they are around 25% more likely than average to live in families with no savings. The report says a fresh approach is needed, including the extension of sick pay to 2 million low earners currently excluded and an increase in unemployment benefits and universal credit to £100 per week. It says a rise in unemployment is inevitable as some firms go bust and the self-employed lose work. “To strengthen the safety net that many families will rely on in the months ahead, the government should increase the generosity of jobseeker’s allowance, employment support allowance and the standard rate of universal credit. From April these benefits will pay just £74 a week to a single adult – and just £59 to those under 25) – when losing their jobs,” the report says. “This is the same as they were paying in the early 1990s, despite the economy growing by more than half since then. Increasing their value by around a third to £100 per week (for an adult aged 25 and over) would cost around £10bn a year. Going further to up-rate other means-tested working-age benefits by 10% would cost a further £3bn.”', 'charCount': '5118', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/phillipinman"">Phillip Inman</a> and <a href=""profile/robertbooth"">Robert Booth</a>'}","[{'id': 'politics/economy', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Economic policy', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economy', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/economy', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/politics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics', 'references': [], 'description': '<p><br></p>'}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'money/pay', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Pay', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/pay', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/pay', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/unemployment', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Unemployment', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/unemployment', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/unemployment', 'references': []}, {'id': 'money/family-finances', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Family finances', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/family-finances', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/family-finances', 'references': []}, {'id': 'money/work-and-careers', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Work & careers', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/work-and-careers', 'references': []}, {'id': 'money/money', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Money', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/money', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/money', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/rishi-sunak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Rishi Sunak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/rishi-sunak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/gordon-brown', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Gordon Brown', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/gordon-brown', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/business', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Business', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/business', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/business', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/greg-clark', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Greg Clark', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/greg-clark', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/greg-clark', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/phillipinman', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Phillip Inman', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phillipinman', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/phillipinman', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Phillip Inman is economics editor of the Observer and&nbsp;an economics writer for the Guardian.

As pressure mounts on the government to restore business and consumer confidence, the Resolution Foundation said a new work subsidy modelled on maternity pay should be available for workers threatened with redundancy. The statutory retention pay would allow firms to put staff on leave without making them redundant, supporting a million workers via a flat-rate subsidy to employers worth £151 per week for an initial six months. The statutory pay retention scheme would cost around £3.6bn, the thinktank said, while a more ambitious earnings-linked scheme, in which staff are paid at least two-thirds of their typical salary – above the minimum £151 per week threshold – would cost around £8bn over six months. The Citizens Advice Bureau proposed an alternative “crisis minimum income” of at least £180 a week so everyone has enough money “to protect their own health and the health of others”. Adding to criticism that ministers have moved slowly to protect vulnerable workers from dramatic falls in income, the Conservative former business secretary Greg Clark joined the Labour former prime minister Gordon Brown in urging the government to act immediately to prevent mass job losses by allowing the taxpayer to subsidise companies’ wage bills. Meanwhile, 46 opposition MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak demanding “a basic income payment for all citizens to see them through this crisis”. Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Germany are among the European countries that have already taken action to directly shore up workers’ incomes. Clark, who resigned as business secretary rather than serve under Johnson, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons warning the government that the £330bn loan scheme announced by Sunak as chancellor on Tuesday would not prevent firms from laying-off their staff. “These businesses have no idea when they would be able to pay back the debt that they would incur. It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said. Brown said Sunak must do “considerably more” by the weekend to protect people’s jobs. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “He says he’ll do more but the package should be out now to avoid redundancies being forced upon companies over the next day or two.

As British tourists waited for details on Dominic Raab’s £75m rescue mission, the German embassy in London revealed it had now repatriated 42,000 German nationals from 60 countries on 160 charter flights over the past two weeks. The UK, in contrast, has rescued just 1,400 British nationals from Wuhan and Peru on charter flights, including the passengers on two British Airways planes that landed at Gatwick airport on Tuesday. An estimated 300,000 Britons are thought to be stranded around the world as countries closed borders and grounded commercial flights in an effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The transport secretary said on Tuesday that as many as 750,000 UK citizens had been stuck overseas at the start of the outbreak, making it the biggest repatriation effort in peacetime. Grant Shapps said the government had so far helped more than 160,000 Britons get home from Spain, Morocco and Cyprus via commercial airlines. The scale of the rescue task emerged as one of the charter companies hired by the German government said it had offered assistance to the UK but that the Foreign Office had not returned its calls. Air Charter Service, which helped organise flights following the collapse of Thomas Cook and Monarch airlines, told the Guardian that it had been hired by France, the Netherlands, the US and Germany in the past nine days but had not had any contact from the UK. “We’ve worked with the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] before but they are just not returning our calls,” said Matthew Purton, head of commercial aviation, adding that he was surprised the UK government had not been in touch. Purton said his company had flown to the Philippines, Bolivia and Cuba to repatriate 4,000 Germans in the past nine days. “What the FCO is doing now is great and you have to give them credit because they are trying to rescue some people from places which are diplomatically sensitive and where we do not have very good diplomatic relations, but that is where a diplomatic solution is called for, but we are there ready and waiting for their calls and can do anything from 19-seater planes to Airbus A380s,” he said. Raab said on Monday the UK would charter flights where commercial options were not available. Shapps acknowledged the efforts of Germany, but said the UK had a far greater challenge on its hands with up to 750,000 people initially stranded. This compares to the 200,000 German nationals hit by the travel lockdowns, of which around 50,000 were stranded. Shapps said that so far more than 160,000 Britons have been able to get home from Spain, Morocco and Cyprus via commercial airlines. In India, where commercial flights have been grounded for at least a week, dozens of Britons are believed to be among more than 2,100 travellers rescued by the German embassy using specially chartered aircraft. Chris Linford, 56, a cafe owner from Derbyshire, said he and his family were among a group of about 40 British tourists on a German flight from Delhi to Frankfurt on Friday. On Tuesday, he praised the German government for their “unbelievable” repatriation effort and accused the UK of being missing in action. “You can’t get through to anyone at the British embassy in Delhi – we spent about £120 trying to get through to them and the last we heard was ‘be patient’,” he said. Linford said he and his family were told to wait at the German ambassador’s residence in Delhi on Friday, where they were provided with food and water before being escorted under armed guard in 12 coaches to the airport.

Linford said his family had spent more than £4,000 on three flights that were cancelled when India grounded all commercial flights on 24 March. The German government has 1,000 members of staff working on the repatriation effort at its foreign office. Its embassy in London said it had chartered planes directly for 43 countries, with the remainder getting home on 17 rescue flights organised by other EU member states. The UK ambassador in Indonesia revealed it had been offered 40 seats on a flight out of Jakarta to Frankfurt. “Our German friends are at it again,” the British embassy in Jakarta said on Twitter. “They’ve opened 40 places on Friday 3 April at 17.25,” it tweeted, adding that the cost would be “regular economy”.",5035,false,false,"<a href=""profile/lisaocarroll"">Lisa O'Carroll</a> and <a href=""profile/josh-halliday"">Josh Halliday</a>",,,4,2020-04-01T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-03-31,2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,0

responsible behaviour because everybody understood very well the importance of being united to tackle an unexpected pandemic with dramatic consequences,” said António Sales, Portugal’s secretary of

If recent days and parliamentary sessions are anything to go by, the prime minister will not be in for an easy ride. At a time when opposition parties elsewhere in Europe are rallying around the flag, the adversaries of Sánchez’s socialist-led coalition are using the virus as a cudgel. The government has been bitterly criticised for allowing huge marches around the country to celebrate International Women’s Day on 8 March, for reacting too slowly to the pandemic, and for inconsistencies and delays in publishing some statistics. On Monday, the leader of the conservative People’s party (PP) announced that he felt unable to support another two-week extension of the emergency situation. Pablo Casado said the crisis measures, initially designed to contain the disease and prevent the collapse of the country’s intensive care units, were no longer necessary at a time when people were once again being allowed outdoors. He also accused Sánchez of hasty improvisation and said the PP would not tolerate the minority government’s “immoral” attempts to “hold Spaniards hostage”. Casado’s language was in keeping with his sustained criticisms of the government – if slightly more moderate than on previous occasions. “You don’t deserve the support of the opposition,” he told Sánchez in April. “Your arrogance, your lies and your ineffectiveness are an explosive combination for Spain.” Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, is also refusing to support an extension and has likened Sánchez to a surgeon who kills healthy people on his operating table. According to Abascal, the socialists and their partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Podemos alliance are seeking to replace democratic normality with “a totalitarian one based on uncertainty that has brought Spain nothing but more death, more ruin, more unemployment and less freedom”. The pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party has said it will not support the extension either, saying that while exceptional measures are still required, the state of emergency – which has allowed the central government to oversee the national response – is not. Meanwhile, some separatist Catalan politicians have suggested that there would have been fewer Covid-19 deaths in an independent Catalonia, and accused the central government of sending 1,714,000 facemasks to the region in a barbed reference to the fall of Barcelona at the end of the Spanish war of succession in 1714. To secure a fresh extension in the country’s 350-seat congress, the government needs only a simple majority – more votes in favour than against. Much will depend on whether the PP’s 88 MPs abstain from the vote – in which case the extension will pass – or whether they vote no, in which case Sánchez will have to rely on the backing of smaller parties to swell the 155 votes of the coalition government. The government has hit back at its critics, accusing Casado of acting irresponsibly during a global emergency, and pointing out that the PP rules the Madrid region, the area hardest hit by the virus. The Madrid regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, apologised last week after the closure of a huge field hospital at Madrid’s main conference centre was marked with a large and crowded ceremony. Photos showed people seeming to ignore social distancing and Ayuso serving a fried squid sandwich to the deputy mayor of Madrid. The party was also embarrassed recently after pictures emerged, apparently showing the former PP leader and prime minister Mariano Rajoy ignoring the lockdown and going our for walks weeks before outdoor exercise was allowed. José Pablo Ferrándiz, chief researcher for the polling firm Metroscopia, said that for all the caustic rhetoric, surveys consistently show that Spaniards favour agreement between political parties to help find a way out of the crisis. Ferrándiz said the PP’s refusal to be seen to support the government stemmed partly from its fear of being eclipsed by Vox. “Even though the polls suggest they’re still the leaders of the Spanish right and have consolidated their position, the PP are still looking in the rear-view mirror to see whether Vox are catching them up,” he said. “They’re not looking towards the centre, where there are more people and more room for the PP to grow.” Berta Barbet, a political scientist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, said that Casado had spent so many months on the offensive against the government that any change of tack would be seized on and exploited by Vox. But, she added, the current rows over the coronavirus crisis also reflect the historic lack of a centre in Spanish political culture. “Traditionally, it’s been two quite distinct blocs, and any attempt to create a centre ground or find consensus to deal with issues such as education reform or pension reform has been very difficult because of the big ideological differences between the two blocs,” she said. “Culturally, there’s been a lot of resentment and collaborating with the other bloc is seen as a betrayal of your party’s values.” Sánchez and his cabinet may well be looking enviously across the border at Portugal, where another socialist minority government concedes that the support of opposition parties has helped it fight Covid-19. “Political parties have adopted a responsible behaviour because everybody understood very well the importance of being united to tackle an unexpected pandemic with dramatic consequences,” said António Sales, Portugal’s secretary of state for health.",5682,false,false,"<a href=""profile/samjones"">Sam Jones</a> in Madrid",,,,,,,,,2020-05-05,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

The Guardian has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking individuals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system. Any move to create such a global tracking system would represent a major escalation in efforts to use mobile phone location data to help stem the pandemic, and would be likely to raise concerns among privacy and security experts. Until now the use of mobile phone tracking in the fight against Covid-19 has been restricted to national governments, which are either monitoring data within their borders or in discussions with mobile operators and technology companies about doing so. They include the US, India, Iran, Poland, Singapore, Israel and South Korea. The British government is engaged in talks with BT, the owner of the UK mobile operator EE, about using phone location and usage data to determine the efficacy of isolation orders. The concept of an international mobile tracing scheme would go further, enabling authorities to monitor movements and potentially track the spread of the disease across borders. The GSMA represents the interests of 750 mobile phone operators and vendors across the world and helps set international standards for companies. A person familiar with its exploratory talks said they were at an early stage and that decisions had not yet been made about whether to move ahead with the plan. The aim of such a global network would be to enact “contact tracing”, enabling authorities to use mobile location data to track who a person infected with Covid-19 may have come in contact with. A spokesperson for GSMA strenuously denied it was currently involved in any project to create a global tracking system. “We are not involved in a project of this nature,” the GSMA spokesperson said. However the GSMA also said it would not comment on discussions that had taken place or ideas that were being explored. “In this emergency situation, the GSMA and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against Covid-19,” Mats Granryd, the director of the GSMA, said in a statement emailed to the Guardian. “We are engaging with operators, policymakers and international organisations around the world to explore viable mobile big data and AI solutions to fight this pandemic while adhering to principles of privacy and ethics.” Advocates of using mobile phone technology in medical emergencies say accurate and up-to-date information can be a vital tool. The Washington Post reported last week that the US government was in active talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans’ phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus. The emergency measures approved by the Israeli government last week go further, enabling authorities to track individual people suspected or confirmed to have been infected to notify individuals who may have come into contact with them. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules. The proposed UK scheme would involve anonymised mobile phone data being used to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working. It could also be used to send health alerts. While the information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns over the scheme, calling for “radical transparency” in the way the government uses mobile data. One telecommunications expert, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said GSMA would be capable of creating a global data-sharing network if mobile operators around the world agreed to share usage information. That data would then be used to help authorities visualise the spread of the disease, or to track individual subscribers to perform “contact tracing”, using an individual’s location to detect how the disease might spread.

He said: “However, it’s common sense that if someone is coughing and spluttering then it makes complete sense to wear masks in order to protect other people and I think that’s what this is about. “I think the guidance we’re expecting to hear that people wearing a face mask is a voluntary activity, not mandated, makes sense and certainly makes a lot of sense to focus limited resources that we have at the moment on those who have greatest need and that’s the health professionals.” He said people with common viruses and colds might want to wear a mask in public once restrictions had been lifted further down the line. He said: “This sophisticated kit is likely to be more rigorous, more useful, but actually it’s perfectly reasonable to wear a bandanna around your mouth or whatever, that will work. It won’t be quite as good but it will be good enough given the evidence you’re not protecting yourself by wearing these masks unless you happen to be coughing and spluttering.”",3322,false,false,"<a href=""profile/kate-proctor"">Kate Proctor</a> Political correspondent",,,,,,,,,2020-04-23,2020-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,0

An 84-year-old sex offender was confirmed as the first British inmate to die after contracting coronavirus, with another 19 prisoners infected across 10 prisons. The death and rising number of cases behind bars has prompted calls for those with underlying health conditions to be at least temporarily released. Stevens’s son, Danny Weatherson, 31, is in Northumberland prison. He was 17 when he was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 months for attempted robbery of a phone and a coat under a controversial imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence. Under IPPs, which were abolished in 2012 after a European court found them to be unlawful, offenders were given a minimum term but no release date. The sentences were used far more widely than intended, and in many cases for relatively low-level crimes. Aside from a brief period of release during which he was recalled to prison, Weatherson has been in jail for 14 years and his father has been fighting to raise the profile of his son’s plight ever since. Eight months ago, Weatherson was diagnosed with two blood clots on his lung and is receiving medication. Stevens says the emergence of the coronavirus, which affects the respiratory system, has deeply troubled both father and son. “He’s just terrified now,” Stevens says from his home near Gateshead. “He was hoping for a July parole hearing but it appears all the face-to-face hearings have been suspended. I spoke to him five days ago and he was telling us all about his lungs, how they’re feeling worse.” Weatherson, who has bipolar disorder, has attempted to kill himself twice in prison, and Stevens is worried the panic over the virus could deeply upset his son. “They need to hold emergency parole hearings because of the coronavirus. He’s done a lot of time. What are they trying to achieve? They keep a lad in there for 14 years for trying to steal a phone? What does it achieve?” Appeal, a charity law practice that specialises in fighting miscarriages of justice, has called for the temporary or early release of the following groups: prisoners convicted of non-violent offences whose appeal applications have passed the single judge screening stage; prisoners on remand charged with non-violent offences; prisoners aged over 70; prisoners with pre-existing serious health conditions; pregnant women, and all prisoners in category D minimum security open prisons. Emily Bolton, Appeal’s legal director, said: “For the government to leave prisoners to die of Covid-19 behind bars when these deaths could be avoided is like leaving prisoners to drown in Orleans parish prison when the waters rose after Hurricane Katrina. “Britain is better than this, and time is running out to avoid minor offences becoming capital crimes, and life sentences from becoming death sentences.” One of Appeal’s cases is that of Roger Khan, a man with Barret’s Oesphagus, a condition which causes wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Khan, 66, is in Oakwood prison, where a case of Covid-19 has been confirmed. He was sentenced to 30 years for attempted murder and has been in prison for nine years. His partner, Marie, who asked to use a pseudonym, said: “I’m worried he’s going to die in prison. That does worry me. He’s really ill. “I’d like him to be released on tag because of his health.

He should be released on medical grounds.” Another Appeal case is that of Jon Beere, one of the Freshwater Five – five men jailed for smuggling 255kg of cocaine worth £53m in a fishing boat. Beere, 51, who is also in Oakwood, was jailed for 24 years and has served nine. He is due to be released automatically in three years and is currently a category D prisoner. After a long battle to appeal against the conviction, Beere has been granted a permission hearing before three judges and is waiting for a date.

The guy is in healthcare in isolation, and there’s another 15 people in isolation, on lockdown, on the same wing.” She said her husband was “a ‘red band’ prisoner, which means he’s a trusted prisoner, so he has access to all the different wings and does jobs, like maintenance, supplies. “He is literally on every wing, so in that respect that worries me because he could have come into contact – we know how long the germs can live on metal surfaces, prison is pretty much full of metal surfaces.” She said the authorities should release all category D prisoners or those who had a short time left to serve. John Whitwam, the managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, which operates Oakwood prison, said: “We have confirmed one case of coronavirus at HMP Oakwood. The health and safety of our staff and the people in our care is our top priority and we have existing, well-developed policies and procedures in place to manage outbreaks of infectious diseases. “We are in regular discussion with Public Health England and are following their guidance. The person concerned had already been self-isolating since last Tuesday, in accordance with national guidance, and will remain in isolation and in regular consultation with our on-site health professionals. His family have been contacted and will be kept up to date.” A Prison Service spokesperson said: “The government’s absolute priority is to protect health and we have robust and flexible plans in place to keep prisoners, staff and the wider public safe based on the latest advice from Public Health England.”",6025,false,false,"<a href=""profile/jamie-grierson"">Jamie Grierson</a> Home affairs correspondent",,,22,2020-03-27T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-03-26,2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,0

A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8370901/glenn-murrays-nods-in-winner-with-his-crotch-as-brighton-see-off-west-brom-in-fa-cup-replay/"">goal with his penis</a> in 2019. I watched the clip several times.</p> <p>The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay"">Sunderland ’Til I Die</a> that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn’t missed a Sunderland game in years.</p> <p>I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She’d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country’s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. “Football feels very small in the grand scheme of things,” she said. “People can’t see their families. I haven’t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, ‘Oh, I’m missing the football,’ they’d probably give me a slap.”</p> <p>There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? “Oh <em>God,</em> yeah,” she said. “Massively. Massively.”</p> <p>I was, too. I’d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they’d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b/0_783_2362_1447/1000.jpg"" alt=""Illustration of a table tennis bat with  a ball shaped like a cornovarius"" width=""1000"" height=""613"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘An afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis was like watching events from space.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I’d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O’Reely.</p> <p>Production-wise, it wasn’t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week’s time.</p> <p>“You’re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You’re like someone who’s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.” This was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/09/james-o-brien-interview-lbc"">James O’Brien, the LBC radio presenter</a>, who I’d called up at home. O’Brien, who used to watch about eight hours of live sport a week, was one of the first to wonder aloud what its absence would be doing to the nation’s mental health, and I was curious to know how he was managing. “I’m not watching Belarusian football, no,” said O’Brien, “but there is a massive gap that’s been left and nothing is quite filling it.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1/0_25_4336_2921/1000.jpg"" alt=""In this photo taken on Thursday, March 19, 2020, players are in action during the Belarus Championship soccer match between Energetik-BGU and Bate in Minsk, Belarus."" width=""1000"" height=""674"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Energetik take on Minsk in the Belarus Premier League in March.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On his radio show, he said, he was hearing from dozens of people every day as they described their lives in this strange and unsettling period. “And this has really come across to me, speaking to people, how hard it has been to find moments of mental space. I see now that sport was one of those doorways to a clear mind. I realise what value it had, emotionally. Because there was the distraction of the sport itself – but, almost as important, there was the comfort and reassurance that the sport was <em>there</em>.” He said he still found himself flicking to “the 400s” – the sports channels on Sky – just in case.</p> <p>What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn’t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space.</p> <p>Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. “I’m not sure,” O’Brien had said, “that Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment. What, have they discovered something about coronavirus the rest of us haven’t?” He was right. Belarus was currently the only country in Europe with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/29/belarus-football-continues-coronavirus-premier-league"" title="""">an active football competition</a>. The country did not seem to have any special handle on the problem of coronavirus; its sports administrators had just decided to carry on regardless. The country’s president, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko"">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that<strong> </strong>it “is the best <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/mar/29/there-are-no-viruses-here-belarus-president-plays-ice-hockey-amid-covid-19-pandemic-video"">anti-virus remedy</a>”. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers’ union, had described the situation as “not comprehendible”. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Watching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy. And that’s why we need it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A handful of other hold-out sports bodies had been refusing to bow to the pandemic. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc"">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, <a href=""https://www.wwe.com/"">WWE</a>, had somehow secured “essential” business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCygUhvsu653-ldNvT4Wr_pw"" title="""">They were putting on internet darts</a>, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom. The results were broadcast in split-screen on YouTube.</p> <p>And I tried to love it. I so admired internet darts, for the effort involved, and the example being set. But all I was really watching was a pair of physically distanced dartboards and the jerky appearance of arrows that had been thrown by an invisible hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile I’d been learning a lot about the anatomy of a sports obsession. To be properly compelling, I knew now, sport had to be live. It had to have consequences. And it had to be human. I wanted to watch human achievement, but more than that I wanted to watch humans achieving.</p> <p>Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball. The sport’s governing body, <a href=""https://www.nba.com/"">the NBA</a>, had organised a stay-at-home free-throw competition, with male and female pros competing against each other from their gardens and driveways while a studio host kept score. They leapt about. They chuntered and teased each other, completing nifty, unlikely throws from all angles until one of them triumphed. I didn’t have the right subscription channel to see the action as it happened, so I found the replays online and followed along as if they were live – squinting where necessary to avoid accidentally discovering the results in the page furniture, and eventually leaning a book against the bottom of my screen to hide the absolute spoiler pit that was the comments section.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f/0_100_2362_2133/1000.jpg"" alt=""Illustration of  hand with finger up, balancing a baseball shaped like a cornovarius"" width=""1000"" height=""903"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Epiphany! If I could enjoy a backyard basketball competition (watched on delay, cowering from spoilers, simulating live conditions), why not a historical sporting contest with some more meat on the bone? I messaged friends whose knowledge of American sports went anorak-deep. What had I missed in recent seasons? What was out there, online, that I was ignorant of and could watch as if it were live? We put together a bill of fare, plucking the better games from three major American sports. A starter of ice hockey (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ"">Maple Leafs v</a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ""> Flyers</a>), a main of basketball (<a href=""https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/"">Raptors v</a><a href=""https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/""> Warriors</a>), baseball for pudding (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live"">Nationals v</a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live""> Astros</a>). It took hours to consume all this hand-picked good stuff. There was an epic penalty shootout. Two celebratory confetti showers! But something was off.</p> <p>When I knew to expect grand drama, I was impatient for it, and I started fast-forwarding for the sexy bits. Any thrills did not feel earned, and it occurred to me for the first time that one of the perverse appeals of live sport might be the obligatory waiting – all that hanging around for a result to land, worrying it might wind up being a hideous waste of time.</p> <p>“Sport speaks to the drama of the unknown,” the president of Eurosport, Andrew Georgiou, told me. “We hope for something. But we don’t know we’re going to get it.” At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring. Georgiou and his team had to hustle to fill the gaps with archive material and virtual sports. “I’m looking at my calendar for the week,” he said, “and everything’s planned. I know exactly what I’m doing every minute of the week. Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama… The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.”</p> <p>I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together.</p> <p>Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1/0_153_4300_2579/1000.jpg"" alt=""Katherine Brunt (c) and Anya Shrubsole (r) of England Women celebrate England men winning the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand during Day Three of the International Friendly match between England Women and Australia A Women at Millfield School on July 14, 2019 in Glastonbury, England.

I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men’s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. “We’d just played Australia. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/31/womens-ashes-england-v-australia-third-final-t20-live-cricket"">Absolutely spanked them</a>.” But do you know what, Brunt added? <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching"">Watching the men’s team win</a> on TV was almost better.</p> <p>“When you’re playing, you can’t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you’re watching sport, though, you can let it <em>all</em> out.” There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. “Watching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,” she told me. “And that’s why we need it.”</p> <p>She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts. It’s going to be a long summer.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""bbb7ef147562ba0f7cfc0ab168e3eca6da152b4b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb7ef147562ba0f7cfc0ab168e3eca6da152b4b/0_68_2362_2166/1000.jpg"" alt=""Illustration of cricket stumps with a ball shaped like a cornovarius"" width=""1000"" height=""917"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <h2>Howzat! <strong>Where to get your sporting fix</strong></h2> <p><strong>American football</strong> There are full-game replays of big-match encounters at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/nfl"" title="""">youtube.com/nfl</a>.

Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk. I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I’d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O’Reely. Production-wise, it wasn’t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week’s time. “You’re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You’re like someone who’s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.” This was James O’Brien, the LBC radio presenter, who I’d called up at home. O’Brien, who used to watch about eight hours of live sport a week, was one of the first to wonder aloud what its absence would be doing to the nation’s mental health, and I was curious to know how he was managing. “I’m not watching Belarusian football, no,” said O’Brien, “but there is a massive gap that’s been left and nothing is quite filling it.” On his radio show, he said, he was hearing from dozens of people every day as they described their lives in this strange and unsettling period. “And this has really come across to me, speaking to people, how hard it has been to find moments of mental space. I see now that sport was one of those doorways to a clear mind. I realise what value it had, emotionally. Because there was the distraction of the sport itself – but, almost as important, there was the comfort and reassurance that the sport was there.” He said he still found himself flicking to “the 400s” – the sports channels on Sky – just in case. What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn’t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space. Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. “I’m not sure,” O’Brien had said, “that Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment. What, have they discovered something about coronavirus the rest of us haven’t?” He was right. Belarus was currently the only country in Europe with an active football competition. The country did not seem to have any special handle on the problem of coronavirus; its sports administrators had just decided to carry on regardless. The country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that it “is the best anti-virus remedy”. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers’ union, had described the situation as “not comprehendible”. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me. A handful of other hold-out sports bodies had been refusing to bow to the pandemic. The Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, WWE, had somehow secured “essential” business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly. They were putting on internet darts, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom. The results were broadcast in split-screen on YouTube. And I tried to love it. I so admired internet darts, for the effort involved, and the example being set. But all I was really watching was a pair of physically distanced dartboards and the jerky appearance of arrows that had been thrown by an invisible hand. Meanwhile I’d been learning a lot about the anatomy of a sports obsession. To be properly compelling, I knew now, sport had to be live. It had to have consequences. And it had to be human. I wanted to watch human achievement, but more than that I wanted to watch humans achieving. Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball. The sport’s governing body, the NBA, had organised a stay-at-home free-throw competition, with male and female pros competing against each other from their gardens and driveways while a studio host kept score. They leapt about. They chuntered and teased each other, completing nifty, unlikely throws from all angles until one of them triumphed. I didn’t have the right subscription channel to see the action as it happened, so I found the replays online and followed along as if they were live – squinting where necessary to avoid accidentally discovering the results in the page furniture, and eventually leaning a book against the bottom of my screen to hide the absolute spoiler pit that was the comments section. Epiphany! If I could enjoy a backyard basketball competition (watched on delay, cowering from spoilers, simulating live conditions), why not a historical sporting contest with some more meat on the bone? I messaged friends whose knowledge of American sports went anorak-deep. What had I missed in recent seasons? What was out there, online, that I was ignorant of and could watch as if it were live? We put together a bill of fare, plucking the better games from three major American sports. A starter of ice hockey (Maple Leafs v Flyers), a main of basketball (Raptors v Warriors), baseball for pudding (Nationals v Astros). It took hours to consume all this hand-picked good stuff. There was an epic penalty shootout. Two celebratory confetti showers! But something was off. When I knew to expect grand drama, I was impatient for it, and I started fast-forwarding for the sexy bits. Any thrills did not feel earned, and it occurred to me for the first time that one of the perverse appeals of live sport might be the obligatory waiting – all that hanging around for a result to land, worrying it might wind up being a hideous waste of time. “Sport speaks to the drama of the unknown,” the president of Eurosport, Andrew Georgiou, told me. “We hope for something. But we don’t know we’re going to get it.” At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring. Georgiou and his team had to hustle to fill the gaps with archive material and virtual sports. “I’m looking at my calendar for the week,” he said, “and everything’s planned. I know exactly what I’m doing every minute of the week. Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama… The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.” I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together. Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist. Brunt was an armchair fan who favoured multiple screens, she said: a big TV and a couple of laptops was the ideal. I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men’s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. “We’d just played Australia. Absolutely spanked them.” But do you know what, Brunt added? Watching the men’s team win on TV was almost better. “When you’re playing, you can’t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you’re watching sport, though, you can let it all out.” There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. “Watching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,” she told me. “And that’s why we need it.” She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts. It’s going to be a long summer. Howzat!

Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves.</p> <p>Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus.</p> <p>What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer’s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix"" title="""">agreed to take part in a virtual </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix"" title="""">grand </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix"" title="""">prix</a> that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/02/liam-payne-on-life-after-one-direction-it-was-touch-and-go-i-was-slowly-losing-the-plot"">Liam Payne</a>.

Will he catch Jenson Button?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: F1 Esports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming – 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic – by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8370901/glenn-murrays-nods-in-winner-with-his-crotch-as-brighton-see-off-west-brom-in-fa-cup-replay/"">goal with his penis</a> in 2019. I watched the clip several times.</p> <p>The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay"">Sunderland ’Til I Die</a> that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn’t missed a Sunderland game in years.</p> <p>I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She’d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country’s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. “Football feels very small in the grand scheme of things,” she said. “People can’t see their families. I haven’t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, ‘Oh, I’m missing the football,’ they’d probably give me a slap.”</p> <p>There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? “Oh <em>God,</em> yeah,” she said. “Massively. Massively.”</p> <p>I was, too. I’d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they’d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1.

Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves. Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus. What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer’s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, agreed to take part in a virtual grand prix that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by Liam Payne. I decided then that virtual sports were not going to cut it for me. For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming – 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic – by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute goal with his penis in 2019. I watched the clip several times. The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series Sunderland ’Til I Die that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn’t missed a Sunderland game in years. I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She’d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country’s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. “Football feels very small in the grand scheme of things,” she said. “People can’t see their families. I haven’t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, ‘Oh, I’m missing the football,’ they’d probably give me a slap.” There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? “Oh God, yeah,” she said. “Massively. Massively.” I was, too. I’d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they’d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk. I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I’d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O’Reely. Production-wise, it wasn’t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week’s time. “You’re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You’re like someone who’s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.” This was James O’Brien, the LBC radio presenter, who I’d called up at home. O’Brien, who used to watch about eight hours of live sport a week, was one of the first to wonder aloud what its absence would be doing to the nation’s mental health, and I was curious to know how he was managing. “I’m not watching Belarusian football, no,” said O’Brien, “but there is a massive gap that’s been left and nothing is quite filling it.” On his radio show, he said, he was hearing from dozens of people every day as they described their lives in this strange and unsettling period. “And this has really come across to me, speaking to people, how hard it has been to find moments of mental space. I see now that sport was one of those doorways to a clear mind. I realise what value it had, emotionally. Because there was the distraction of the sport itself – but, almost as important, there was the comfort and reassurance that the sport was there.” He said he still found himself flicking to “the 400s” – the sports channels on Sky – just in case. What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn’t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space. Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. “I’m not sure,” O’Brien had said, “that Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment. What, have they discovered something about coronavirus the rest of us haven’t?” He was right. Belarus was currently the only country in Europe with an active football competition. The country did not seem to have any special handle on the problem of coronavirus; its sports administrators had just decided to carry on regardless. The country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that it “is the best anti-virus remedy”. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers’ union, had described the situation as “not comprehendible”. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me. A handful of other hold-out sports bodies had been refusing to bow to the pandemic. The Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, WWE, had somehow secured “essential” business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly. They were putting on internet darts, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom. The results were broadcast in split-screen on YouTube. And I tried to love it. I so admired internet darts, for the effort involved, and the example being set. But all I was really watching was a pair of physically distanced dartboards and the jerky appearance of arrows that had been thrown by an invisible hand. Meanwhile I’d been learning a lot about the anatomy of a sports obsession. To be properly compelling, I knew now, sport had to be live. It had to have consequences. And it had to be human. I wanted to watch human achievement, but more than that I wanted to watch humans achieving. Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball. The sport’s governing body, the NBA, had organised a stay-at-home free-throw competition, with male and female pros competing against each other from their gardens and driveways while a studio host kept score. They leapt about. They chuntered and teased each other, completing nifty, unlikely throws from all angles until one of them triumphed. I didn’t have the right subscription channel to see the action as it happened, so I found the replays online and followed along as if they were live – squinting where necessary to avoid accidentally discovering the results in the page furniture, and eventually leaning a book against the bottom of my screen to hide the absolute spoiler pit that was the comments section. Epiphany! If I could enjoy a backyard basketball competition (watched on delay, cowering from spoilers, simulating live conditions), why not a historical sporting contest with some more meat on the bone? I messaged friends whose knowledge of American sports went anorak-deep. What had I missed in recent seasons? What was out there, online, that I was ignorant of and could watch as if it were live? We put together a bill of fare, plucking the better games from three major American sports. A starter of ice hockey (Maple Leafs v Flyers), a main of basketball (Raptors v Warriors), baseball for pudding (Nationals v Astros). It took hours to consume all this hand-picked good stuff. There was an epic penalty shootout. Two celebratory confetti showers! But something was off. When I knew to expect grand drama, I was impatient for it, and I started fast-forwarding for the sexy bits. Any thrills did not feel earned, and it occurred to me for the first time that one of the perverse appeals of live sport might be the obligatory waiting – all that hanging around for a result to land, worrying it might wind up being a hideous waste of time. “Sport speaks to the drama of the unknown,” the president of Eurosport, Andrew Georgiou, told me. “We hope for something. But we don’t know we’re going to get it.” At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring.

    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>
     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>
    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>
    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;<b>Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days</b>.</p>
    <p>If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.</p>
    <p>If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.</p>
    <p>After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.</p>
    <p><b>If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.</b></p>
    <p>If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.<br></p>
    <p>Staying at home means you should:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>not go to work, school or public areas</li>
     <li>not use public transport or taxis</li>
     <li>not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home</li>
     <li>not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – <b>but stay at least 2 metres away from other people</b>.</p>

<p>During that honeymoon period, it was largely accepted that Johnson was acting correctly by following scientific advice advocating “herd immunity.” This was challenged by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19"">other scientists, such as William Hanage</a>, but counter arguments got little media traction.

<p>More than a week passed before the second phase saw natural journalistic scepticism kick in. Johnson found himself fielding pertinent questions. Did he really think “herd immunity” was either a practical or moral response? Sure, he was relying on the science, but were the scientists on which he was basing his policy right?</p> 
<p>Watching his press conferences, it was possible to sense a growing frustration among the questioning political editors. They were polite, as was he. He took care to name them – “thank you, Laura” … “yes, Beth” … “where’s Heather?” – and, after repeating his central messages about handwashing and social distancing, he passed the trickier inquiries to his scientific wingmen.</p> 
<p>As an exercise in transparency it just about held up, although it didn’t really amount to public accountability because it was impossible for the journalists to be as fierce and forensic as MPs in the Commons during prime minister’s questions.

But, like the Telegraph titles, it was out of step with the general tone of media coverage which has passed through three phases. These rapid changes of approach echoed the swiftness of the pandemic’s grip on public imagination. Johnson’s dilemma was met initially with a measure of understanding that soon elided into a large dose media credulity. During that honeymoon period, it was largely accepted that Johnson was acting correctly by following scientific advice advocating “herd immunity.” This was challenged by other scientists, such as William Hanage, but counter arguments got little media traction. When the government performed a U-turn in mid-March the BBC tamely accepted the false No 10 line that its strategy changed because the science had changed. More than a week passed before the second phase saw natural journalistic scepticism kick in. Johnson found himself fielding pertinent questions. Did he really think “herd immunity” was either a practical or moral response? Sure, he was relying on the science, but were the scientists on which he was basing his policy right? Watching his press conferences, it was possible to sense a growing frustration among the questioning political editors. They were polite, as was he. He took care to name them – “thank you, Laura” … “yes, Beth” … “where’s Heather?” – and, after repeating his central messages about handwashing and social distancing, he passed the trickier inquiries to his scientific wingmen. As an exercise in transparency it just about held up, although it didn’t really amount to public accountability because it was impossible for the journalists to be as fierce and forensic as MPs in the Commons during prime minister’s questions. Nor were they able to ask supplementary questions. The problem of dealing with Johnsonian evasiveness became more apparent when the conferences were staged remotely. At the beginning of last week came the third phase: overt hostility. It was unsurprising to find the anti-Tory Daily Mirror in the vanguard with its accusation that Johnson and his government “were criminally slow to respond to the threat” and lamenting the “mixed messages and an absence of clarity”. But the “Boris distancing” took hold even in papers previously sympathetic to the government’s plight and even in those noted as fervent cheerleaders for Johnson. Look, for instance, at the Sun’s unexpectedly pointed criticism in a leading article which echoed the Mirror’s viewpoint. It took Johnson to task for taking far too long in enacting legislation to enforce social distancing. “The Sun,” it said, “has largely backed the Downing Street response so far … But there is a shambolic ‘on the hoof’ feel to it now.” Another whose faith was shaken, was one of Johnson’s most enthusiastic press supporters, the aforementioned title’s political columnist, Trevor Kavanagh. Looking to a future public inquiry into the handling of the crisis, he suggested a likely outcome: “It may be that Boris Johnson was too soft, too trusting, too unwilling to make hard choices.” If Kavanagh’s jibe surprised No 10, then the Times’s leader last Monday must have come as a shock. Johnson’s performance “has been chequered”. Why had he “disappeared from view” in February? Why had he failed to preside over the first Cobra meeting to discuss the pandemic? Why, even as the scale became apparent, did he not take greater measures? The Times’s conclusion was laced with sarcasm: “The country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy. Otherwise the prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain.” At the end of the week, the Daily Mail joined the growing chorus of disapproval by accusing the government of having been “lamentably behind the curve” and urging it to “raise its game … fast”. The Sunday Times took a similar line. Why had Britain not tested as widely and efficiently as Germany? The Observer was amazed at the lack of testing kits, as it was with the failure to procure extra stocks of ventilators and personal protective equipment. This media criticism should not be viewed as cynical or carping. Newspapers, in company with broadcast news outlets, have been doing their job. By refusing to accept the official narrative, they have disrupted the government’s agenda and, on the positive side, have played a key role in changing the direction of public policy. They held power to account and found it wanting. Now, with parliament in recess, their job becomes even more important. They must go on questioning and harrying the prime minister. They have to find a way to ensure that an executive backed by an 81-seat majority does not misuse its own version of self-isolation to pursue the wrong route in the difficult weeks ahead.",5727,false,false,"<a href=""profile/roygreenslade"">Roy Greenslade</a>",,,,,,,,,2020-03-29,2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,0

    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>
    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>
     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>
     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>
     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>
     <li>Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>
    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>

<p>A GP at the practice called NHS 111 on the parents’ behalf, but was told the family must call themselves to get help. When they called the helpline, the family were told to attend a GP hub centre, a service to which 111 regularly refers callers, which is not specific to coronavirus.</p>

<p>On arrival, the family were turned away as no appointment had been booked. After calling the helpline again, they received the same advice, but were again turned away after arriving at the centre.</p> 
<p>The doctor they saw on their third attempt reportedly neglected to consider the family’s travel history and diagnosed the infant with a different illness – without testing them for coronavirus.</p> 
<p>“It’s a catch 22,” said Sarah. “The government aren’t doing one thing or the other. They’re not containing it, like they did in China, and they’re not testing for it. They have no idea of the problem.”</p>

<p>Emma*, a doctor at a hospital in London, recently returned from a holiday near northern Italy, where the coronavirus has broken out.</p> 
<p>Her daughter, Alice*, developed symptoms of the virus, and she called the 111 helpline three times. They eventually told her to attend her GP surgery – advice that contradicts Public Health England’s guidance to stay at home.</p> 
<p>The GP instructed them to visit A&amp;E, but the hospital where Emma works refused to test Alice for the virus because their holiday destination fell just 50 miles outside of the affected area. Alice eventually tested positive for the flu, but Emma fears their reluctance to test for coronavirus could facilitate its spread.</p> 
<p>“The affected areas change all the time, so how can you refuse to test on those grounds?” Emma asked. “When I first became worried about Alice, northern Italy didn’t have an outbreak at all. You won’t be able to catch the virus and isolate people if you don’t test them.”</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have been clear from the outset that we expect coronavirus to have some impact on the UK and a global pandemic could have a pronounced effect on the NHS, which is why we are planning for every eventuality.</p>

James*, a GP in Derbyshire, where one of the latest British coronavirus cases is thought to have been located, described the Department of Health’s response to the virus as “ridiculous” and “negligent”. He said none of his patients who had travelled back from at-risk countries had been given any information at airports or sea ports on what to do if they developed symptoms of coronavirus. James said his practice had seen patients arriving back from affected areas, some of whom had been on cruises around many regions experiencing coronavirus outbreaks, who had not been given any information on what to do if they developed symptoms. Other patients reported flying back from the affected countries and finding there was no information on arrival at Heathrow regarding public health advice. The lack of information has led to many booking appointments with their GP, which risks infecting other patients with weaker immune systems. “It’s a no-brainer, the government need to tell those who are coming back what to do,” James said. “They’ve missed almost everyone at this stage of arrivals.” Despite his surgery website and posters clearly instructing people who have travelled to affected regions in recent weeks not to enter the GP practice, James said some patients have “breezed past our bright yellow posters suggesting they stay at home”. “There seems to be an attitude of: ‘We don’t care if we infect a whole GP surgery full of people,’” he said. While many patients had followed Public Health England’s advice to stay at home and call the NHS helpline 111 after returning from affected areas, “some had been told to go into the GP practice”, James said. “The helpline later claimed this advice was given in error, saying that the patient must have selected the wrong telephone answering choice,” he added. Online bookings were proving a further obstacle in the practice’s attempts to prevent the spread of the virus. James’s GP surgery is contractually obliged to offer online booking services, which means they cannot prevent those with symptoms from getting appointments at the practice. James and his colleagues contacted Derbyshire’s clinical commissioning group to try to stop online bookings until after the outbreak had passed, but were told they could not do so until a coronavirus case had been confirmed in the region. It is unclear how Thursday’s confirmed case will impact the practice. “It strikes me as closing the stable door a decade after the horse has bolted,” he said. “The whole approach is as leaky as a sieve.” In south London, one GP practice criticised the government’s response to the virus, after two parents – one of whom had travelled to a number of affected areas in Asia and become sick for a short time afterwards – called the practice after the infant developed symptoms of coronavirus.

Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers.</p> \n  <p>But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the “precautionary principle”, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/scientists-join-calls-for-uk-public-to-wear-homemade-face-masks-outdoors"">adding these can be homemade</a> since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths.<br></p> \n  <p>Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used.</p> \n  <p>“If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),” the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems.</p> \n  <p>The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them.</p> \n  <p>“We’d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],” said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks.</p> \n  <p>In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn’t lead people to becoming complacent.</p> \n  <p>“Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,” the authors add. “However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.”</p> \n </div> \n <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2020-05-01T15:36:28.725Z"">at 4.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-5eac23008f082b32fdd6b7a1"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-05-01T13:29:34.847Z"">2.29pm <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=""block-title"">Government changes how it counts test to hit 100,000 target, report says</h2> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports.</p> \n  <p>Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ.</p> \n  <p>According to the source, the <strong>Department of Health and Social Care</strong> is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people’s homes in its figures – which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab.</p> \n  <p>The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit.</p> \n  <p>You can read the full Health Service Journal story <a href=""https://www.hsj.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=7027544"">here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2020-05-01T14:21:38.708Z"">at 3.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-5eac22538f087d47c77877d8"" class=""block is-summary"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-05-01T13:22:55.477Z"">2.22pm <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=""block-title"">Summary</h2> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p><strong>British Airways</strong>’ parent company has signed agreements for €1bn (£900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports.</p> \n  <p><strong>IAG</strong> said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.

However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.”</p> \n  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible

are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.” <br><br>She added: “We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it’s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.” <br><br>When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: “I don’t think that’s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. <br></p> \n  <p>“It’s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing – obviously we need to tailor that to patients’ individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. <br><br>“It’s very important that we get

At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4). Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is “past the peak”. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, “Progress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions”. Face coverings have a “weak but positive effect” in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM’s spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn’t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a “personal choice”. Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. That’s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coronavirus coverage, head over to our global live blog for the worldwide picture. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated. In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. “I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,” he said. “I can announce that we have met our goal.” Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an “incredible achievement” and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the government’s reach as recently as last week. But earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. This is from the shadow health secretary The number of confirmed cases among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. A Public Health England paper published earlier this week said there was cause for “cautious optimism” across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year. Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses? Hancock says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic. He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk? Powis says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff. Work is being done to understand why this is, he says. Newton says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds. The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says. Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds. PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says. Powis adds this data isn’t needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do what’s necessary to protect BME workers. And that’s it, the press conference has ended. Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace? Hancock says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country. Moving together was the right approach, he says. He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace. Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead? Hancock says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK. Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over? Hancock says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield. Powis adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease. A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says. Everybody is being asked to stay at home so we’re all in the same boat in that sense, he adds. As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration. Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday? Hancock says it’s tempting to speculate on this but it’s still too early to say, we just don’t know, he says. The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says. We’ll only lift lockdown measures when it’s safe to do so, he says. As of today, it’s too soon to say. Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true? Newton says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says. The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme they’re counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way. That’s the way they are counted, have always been counted and were advised to count them by officials. Q. What’s your reaction to the report that you’re twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have? Hancock says this is something we’re worried about and looking at. It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation – these are all being looked at, he says. Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but haven’t actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? Newton says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS. There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken. That makes up the breakdown of today’s testing figure, he says. Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time? Newton says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise. You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds. Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children don’t seem able to transmit the disease? Powis says if a child is symptomatic, there’s no reason to think they won’t transmit like anyone else. The question is for children who don’t have any symptoms who get the virus, he says. How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question we’re still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says. Newton says this is his understanding also. Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested? Hancock says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot. Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds. This is a new priority for testing, once it’s up and running by the middle of the month, he says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. How do you intend to further develop and extend the testing network? Hancock says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country. A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says. Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says. Newton says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says. The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds. Stuart from Redditch asks if the Nightingale hospitals will be used going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists as we come through the pandemic? Hancock says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19. Powis adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldn’t necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says. They are also there as an insurance policy, he says. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident it’s safe? Hancock says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. We’re not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe, he says. This disease doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. Powis says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says. The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says. Hancock says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says. Powis says most people are avoiding contact with vulnerable people, including 84% of adults have only left their for permitted reasons or not left their home. More people (45%) are working from home since the measures were introduced, he says. The number of tests have increased “dramatically” in the last few days, he says. The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says. Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling. Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. It’s moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards. The number of people in critical care is falling in the four nations, he says. Deaths in all settings is overall showing a downward trend. Prof Powis is going through the slides now. The transmission rate, the reproduction rate, the number of new infections is falling, keeping pressure off the NHS, he says. The five tests for adjusting the lockdown are: the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths reliable data to show rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board PPE and other factors including testing must be in hand with supply to meet future demand a second peak must be avoided as it runs a risk of overwhelming the NHS Prof Newton is speaking now. The decision to enter lockdown was not linked to the lack of tests, he says. Access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would not have made a difference, he says. The decision to enter lockdown would have been the same, and at the same time, he says. We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down. We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK, he says, to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country. The new NHS app is “making rapid progress”. He encourages people to sign up. Hancock says he knew the goal of 100,000 tests by the end of the month was “audacious”. He says the government has met its goal. The number of tests yesterday was 122,347, he says. The health secretary is speaking now. Hancock says he will talk about testing, after the daily statistics. Now that we’re past the peak, the restoration of NHS fertility services can begin, he says. 177,454 people have tested positive, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital, and 27,510 people have now died across all settings, an increase of 739. In a race to meet the government’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evening’s deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing. A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for Great Ormond Street children’s hospital. Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence. On Sunday 18 April, the lab apparently received no samples at all. However, since Wednesday the situation has reversed, with technicians now processing as many as 600 samples a day. The Guardian understands that all patients and staff, whether they have Covid-19 symptoms or not, have been encouraged to take the test, along with the families and carers of patients. This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week. Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults. A spokesperson for the hospital said: In line with national guidance we are testing all non-elective in-patients for Covid-19. Where possible we are taking the additional step of testing the parents and carers who accompany them. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will front this afternoon’s daily government news briefing, which is due to begin shortly. He will be joined by Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England. The Premier League’s 20 clubs outlined at a meeting on Friday their determination to complete the season amid the pandemic. Although no decisions were taken on the next steps, the participants are understood to have been pleased with the progress made. A lengthy meeting included plenty of discussion about logistics, including how to lock down grounds and create safe environments, the possibility of playing matches at neutral venues, and protocols around testing, including the regularity with which those should be done. In a statement the league said: The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government’s support. The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers. NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be given roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally, 63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian, according to the Health Service Journal. In this explainer, my colleague Haroon Siddique looks at the figures and explains why BAME people may be more at risk. Care workers in Wales will each receive a £500 bonus to reflect their “value” during the pandemic, the first minister has announced. Mark Drakeford said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the “scaffolding” of services across the country. He told the Welsh government’s daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing. This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society. Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home. Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage. He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing “exceptional circumstances”. Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made. Some mid-afternoon joy. This is from Palmerston, the Foreign Office mouser More than two-thirds of London’s pavements are not wide enough to allow people to follow physical distancing advice to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, according to new research. Only 36% of pavements in Greater London are at least 3 metres wide, allowing pedestrians to meet the government’s advice for people to stay at least 2 metres apart when outdoors, found researchers from University College London. There are also broad variations of the proportion of pavements wide enough to allow physical distancing in different London boroughs, according to the Streets research group, which includes academics from UCL’s Bartlett school of architecture. The City of London has the highest percentage (51%) of streets that meet the minimum requirement, while Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Newham and Haringey all have the lowest (between 26-28%), according to their analysis. Dr Ashley Dhanani, a member of the project team and a research associate at the Bartlett’s Space Syntax Laboratory, said: While some may opt to walk in the road, this is not possible for people with pushchairs or with mobility impairments. Our research shows that there is an urgent need to reallocate street space in London so everyone can use streets safely. You can download a map of London that shows all the streets where there are at least six metres of non-road space here. These are the streets that have enough space on either side for pedestrians to stay 2 metres apart. NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483. The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England: - 70 occurred on 30 April - 148 occurred on 29 April - 39 occurred on 28 April The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. Today’s figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863. Magdalen College, Oxford did their traditional May morning celebrations virtually this year. Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a “promising” treatment for Covid-19. A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK. The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19. Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital. University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date. Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the study’s chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness. Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early. There have been 18 further deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total deaths in the region recorded so far by the Department of Health to 365. The award-winning Scottish orchestra Nevis Ensemble launched the Living Room Ensemble with the aim of putting together a series of performances by musicians and music lovers from across the country, performing at home and shown online. They asked people to submit videos of themselves playing instruments, banging pots and pans, singing along or dancing to the same piece of music. The finished product is now on YouTube, featuring 160 musicians and singers from 15 countries performing I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by The Proclaimers. Good afternoon, I’m Gregory Robinson, If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I’m @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@theguardian.com. McDonald’s is to reopen a number of UK restaurants for delivery from 13 May after closing all of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The locations of the 15 restaurants will be announced next week. The fast food chain has spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites, PA reports. Paul Pomroy, the chain’s boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans. All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast. Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with “contactless thermometers” before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat. Pomroy added: Slowly, but safely, we will return to towns and cities across the UK and Ireland and thank you for your continued support as we work through this crisis.” The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UK’s exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have said in a new report, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste. At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UK’s exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work. However expert advice on the use of face masks among the general public has been mixed. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection – a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers. But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the “precautionary principle”, adding these can be homemade since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths. Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used. “If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),” the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems. The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them. “We’d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],” said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks. In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn’t lead people to becoming complacent. “Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,” the authors add. “However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.” The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports. Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ. According to the source, the Department of Health and Social Care is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people’s homes in its figures – which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab. The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit. You can read the full Health Service Journal story here. British Airways’ parent company has signed agreements for €1bn (£900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports. IAG said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are “restrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies”, the firm added. IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA, representing more than a quarter of its workforce. On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UK’s second busiest airport. In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote: There is no government bailout standing by for BA. Pilots’ union Balpa has vowed it will fight to “save every pilot job at BA”. This is from the first minister of Scotland Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: We know it’s been a high stress environment. We’re planning mental health support right now. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. “The military are very good at this,” she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs’ questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm: We absolutely have not seen that. We’re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone’s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less. The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: Early detection is vital for survival. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. There have been no national instructions on screening. It’s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on. Lifetime Isas are effectively being unlocked temporarily for savers whose incomes have been hit by coronavirus. The rule changes will mean people can access their funds early without facing the usual hefty withdrawal penalty. The Treasury will legislate for a temporary reduction in the Lisa withdrawal charge to 20% between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021. This will generally mean account holders will only have to pay back any government bonus they have received, and they will not have to pay the additional withdrawal charge of 5%. A further 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 925, Public Health Wales said. Another 160 cases were reported, bringing that total to 9,972. It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skulduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Sr’s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as “a tireless self-promoter”. The Rugby Football League has been handed a £16m emergency loan from the government to help “protect the entire sport” throughout the pandemic. Many clubs within the professional game had expressed fears that without external financial support the sport faced a bleak future. The RFL chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, has warned clubs not to see the money as a “gravy train” and has made it clear the cash needs to last as long as possible to ensure clubs survive. He said: It’s not about dropping a lump sum in a club’s bank account and telling them to carry on as normal; we have to be far more meticulous. Needleworkers at Exeter Cathedral, the Company of Tapisers, have been making scrubs for the NHS and have completed 10 sets, with another 14 in progress, since beginning production two weeks ago. The group said the biggest challenge had been finding suitable fabric for volunteers to work on, with materials from as far away as Bradford being requested to meet specifications. The Company of Tapisers has been making vestments, kneelers, banners, cushions, and even rugs and ropes at the cathedral since 1933. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines. The first minister said she was “not convinced there is a huge substantive difference” between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was “choosing to use my own words”. Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated “it is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished”. She also warned: “If we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.” Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this “should not be an exercise in driving up the numbers”. Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: “Yes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions.” She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers. McDonald’s has revealed it will reopen its first UK restaurants for delivery on 13 May after shutting sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The fast-food giant said it would reopen 15 restaurants for delivery only, with the locations of these restaurants being announced next week, after it spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites. Two-thirds of Britons would feel uncomfortable attending large public gatherings, such as sports events or concerts, a new poll suggests, amid warnings the government’s “stay home” advice might have been “slightly too successful”. A recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities – such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport – if the lockdown was eased. It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants. Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s. The polling comes as Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. At this afternoon’s lobby briefing, Downing Street declined to contradict Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The PM’s spokesman said: There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure that we’re best prepared for a future global pandemic, this work will need to be done with our international partners. Budget airline Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday with passengers and crew required to wear face masks. The Hungarian carrier will introduce the new hygiene measures when it reopens its base at the airport, including the wearing of face masks, physical distancing between passengers during boarding and an enhanced cleaning regime. Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia on Friday. Other routes, such as Tenerife and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions. UK lockdown restrictions prevent Britons from being allowed to travel to airports for a holiday. But people are able to fly for other reasons, such as to return home after being stranded overseas or if they are travelling for work. Customers are also being urged to use online services for checking in and making purchases such as additional bags to “reduce non-essential interaction at the airport”, and to use contactless payment methods if they buy anything while on flights. Here are the main takeaways from this afternoon’s Downing Street briefing: Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime minister’s spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. Boris Johnson told yesterday’s press conference: I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work. But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice. The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible. And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. We’re talking about face covering. We’re certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others. With the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, expected to host this evening’s daily press conference, the PM’s spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: The health secretary’s target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is what’s really important.” He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday. The spokesman also didn’t rule out government support for ailing airlines: We’ve been clear we’re prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort. Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the government’s other business support measures. A brand new edition of the popular Top Trumps card game, honouring Covid-19 key and essential workers, hits the shops on Monday. It hails key and essential workers working on the frontline during the pandemic, from doctors and nurses to less high profile sectors such as pest controllers, midwives and sea merchants. Politicians and journalists are also included. One of the four scoring sections in the new game is “unsung heroes”, where the partners of key workers come out top with a maximum 10 out of 10. Nicola Sturgeon has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UK’s Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day. In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK government’s regional drive-through centres. She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing – all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but aren’t already eligible. Yesterday we reported that the Children’s Commissioner Scotland and a coalition of charities had written to supermarket chief executives urging them to stop the barring and abuse of single parents shopping for essentials with their children. As of this morning, three have replied to the letter. Marks and Spencer was first off the mark, saying they had given “clear guidance...that it may be necessary for parents to bring their children shopping with them and under no circumstances should a family be turned away”. Co-op acknowledged the points made and gave assurances for the future, while ScotMid insisted that children would not be restricted in stores. A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital’s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Several readers have been in touch about what the R number, or effective reproduction number, of coronavirus means. This piece from our science correspondent Hannah Devlin provides a very handy explanation. In a nutshell, it’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still “massive demand for travel”, it was vital to plan ahead. Full story here: One of the UK’s largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to Boris Johnson’s claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as “completely shambolic”. MHA, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being “at best disingenuous” when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said: We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday. Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus “no consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents”. This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved. On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting “the spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority”. But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, “in practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus”. We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isn’t. Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the government’s response to the pandemic. A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake “cross-cutting” scrutiny of the government’s response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future. The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks. Lord McFall of Alcluith, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the government’s response to it. Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them. These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations. I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life. Downing Street said the prime minister Boris Johnson chaired the daily Covid-19 meeting on Friday. Number 10 said the the government would announce that the Rugby Football League will receive a £16m cash injection “to safeguard the immediate future of clubs in England”. A spokesman said: The emergency loan will help the sport deal with the extreme financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak while the season remains suspended, due to social distancing measures. High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services. Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible. RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women. She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated “as more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that”. Home births have faced the biggest impact from the pandemic, she said, with services disrupted due to reasons including staffing issues and paramedic ambulance capacity. She said returning to home births would require risk assessments, the return of staffing and testing of women in the community who want to have a baby at home. Olivia Strong, founder of the Run for Heroes 5km Challenge, which has raised £5m for NHS charities, has received the prime minister’s daily Point of Light award. In a personal letter to Olivia, Boris Johnson wrote: As we persevere with the restrictions to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have been inspired by the ingenuity of your Run for Heroes 5km Challenge. Using your daily lockdown exercise to run 5K, donate 5 and nominate 5 people, you have raised more than 5 million to support the extraordinary work of our true heroes - the men and women of our unique NHS. With over a million participants from more than 20 countries, you have roused a global movement that has collectively run the entire distance to the moon and back! Thank you for your brilliant initiative and for all that you have done to support our wonderful NHS. Strong said: It’s an absolute pleasure and delight to accept this award on behalf of the whole Run For Heroes community. Not only the amazing people who have helped with the campaign (India, Alice and my family), but everyone who has continued to run, donate and nominate! It’s been so wonderful to see people coming together for such a worthwhile cause! Good morning!

Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the country’s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, “The initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.” Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening. The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a “tight ship” by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. The pause button has been pushed on the housing market as people and businesses adhere to lockdown measures imposed on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus. Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. She told MPs at the health and social care committee: “Broadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.” She added: “We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it’s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.” When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: “I don’t think that’s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. “It’s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing – obviously we need to tailor that to patients’ individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. “It’s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.” Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through £5.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe “lifeline services” because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. The Belfast-London route “would be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers”, the Department for Transport stated. Shapps said: “Maintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. “We must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and today’s investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.” When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. She said: “A lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. “During the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. “What we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. “Every woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.” Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. The chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives has told MPs she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: “Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. “I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. “I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.” Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. She added: “One of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.” Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths. London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population. Manufacturing in the UK collapsed in April, hitting levels lower than during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, according to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index. The index recorded a score of 32.6 for February – anything above 50 is seen as growth – hitting the lowest level since the survey began 28 years ago, in the first significant sign of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Hello everyone, please do get in touch this morning to share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me while I run the live blog. Thanks.

The event will take place on the early May bank holiday and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan. It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said. Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: “We are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited”. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be “perfectly reasonable” for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Every government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so that’s a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it won’t be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit.” He added: “You don’t need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. “But you certainly can release the lockdown while you’re building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - that’s what most other countries are doing.” Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an “employment catastrophe” as the economy “most affected” by the Covid-19 lockdown. The leader of the borough council and the town’s MP have called on the government to take rapid action and “ensure that Crawley’s amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks”. The letter states: “It is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. “However, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.” Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as “impossible”. He told the PA Media agency: “Social distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. “The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. “If you’ve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. “It’s just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. “So we need a better solution, which means that in a few months’ time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.” After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnson’s “past the peak” optimism and Nicola Sturgeon’s far more cautious warnings that it is “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, “I don’t think it is a sufficient objective”. Expect more questions on this at the first minister’s briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a “substantial” update on testing in Scotland. Coronavirus has killed tens of thousands of people in the UK. Each death is a person who was loved by someone. Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin is writing tributes for those who died during the pandemic. Please email her (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) if you want to share your memories of someone who has passed away. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said: It’s a personal choice, if you have a face mask it’s your choice whether you want to use them and if you walk around some of our towns and cities today you are seeing more people using them than ever before. The advice today is that the difference made by a face covering is quite modest - it doesn’t make a huge difference but it does make some. So it’s your choice. More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research. Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences – including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection – when Covid-19 financial protections end. Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not. According to its research, commissioned by Citizen’s Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus. Morning everyone and welcome to the Guardian’s UK live blog. As ever, please do get in touch while I work this morning. It’s always really useful to get any insight and news tips from readers. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services. There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT). Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. He said that the government will set out a “road map” for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week. Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high – and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. Care homes will be the “epicentres of transmission” for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director. Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis. Britain’s manufacturers have suffered a “collapse” in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests. Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost as part of a restructuring of the airline. Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were “just a stepping stone” to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. “We’ve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and we’re beginning to test essential workers,” he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests. • The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by Italy with 27,967. • Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. • Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the “hysteria” over Covid-19. • The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a “success” even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. “I think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country,” he told Sky News on Friday. “This in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense it’s been a success, but there’s more to be done.” He said that the country now needed to “build some head room” between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. “The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isn’t an exact figure as to where the R is - it’s somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9,” he said. “We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, there’s some space, some room, for manoeuvre.” He added that the government approach was a “cautious easing over time” so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected. The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a “Eurovision approach” and making “naive comparisons” between the UK’s and other countries’ Covid-19 deaths. Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: I think it’s too early to tell our exact place in the league table. My article was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say who’s top, who’s second and so on. It’s just not appropriate to do at all. There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying we’re going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate.” On the government’s advice, Spiegelhalter said: “It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding. Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector … and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that. He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. “That is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. It’s locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.” Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from “stay at home” to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked. Ryanair announced the planned job cuts as it revealed it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June. It said in a statement: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael O’Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll begin with a little brightness today, and share an image I was sent yesterday after my shift ended of a rainbow over London. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Labour politician said: I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. I’d like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.” He added: As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us. Our efforts over the last week have been directed at working with our trade unions, our local authorities and other stakeholders because you can open up anything you like, but if people don’t think it’s safe to take up what is now available to them, they won’t come.”', 'charCount': '78138', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/lucy-campbell"">Lucy Campbell</a> (now); <a href=""profile/gregory-robinson"">Gregory Robinson</a>  and <a href=""profile/sarah-marsh"">Sarah Marsh</a> (earlier)'}","[{'id': 'politics/series/politics-live-with-andrew-sparrow', 'type': 'series', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics live with Andrew Sparrow', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-andrew-sparrow', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/series/politics-live-with-andrew-sparrow', 'references': [], 'description': ""Join Guardian political correspondent Andrew Sparrow as he brings you all the day's political stories live from Westminster and beyond""}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/politics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics', 'references': [], 'description': '<p><br></p>'}, {'id': 'science/infectiousdiseases', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'science', 'sectionName': 'Science', 'webTitle': 'Infectious diseases', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/society', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Society', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/minutebyminute', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Minute by minutes', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/minutebyminute', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/lucy-campbell', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Lucy Campbell', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucy-campbell', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/lucy-campbell', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Lucy Campbell is a Guardian journalist and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/the-guardian-foundation/2018/nov/09/meet-the-scott-trust-bursary-students-201819"">holder of a Scott Trust bursary</a></p>', 'firstName': 'Lucy ', 'lastName': 'Campbell'}, {'id': 'profile/gregory-robinson', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Gregory Robinson', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gregory-robinson', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/gregory-robinson', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Gregory Robinson is a Guardian journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary</p>', 'firstName': 'Gregory', 'lastName': 'Robinson'}, {'id': 'profile/sarah-marsh', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Sarah Marsh', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-marsh', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/sarah-marsh', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Sarah Marsh is a Guardian news reporter.

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Evening summary</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The government said it passed its 100,000 tests per day target</strong><strong>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal"">amid claims the tally has been artificially boosted</a>.</strong> At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. However, the <a href=""https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/revealed-how-government-changed-the-rules-to-hit-100000-tests-target/7027544.article"">HSJ reported</a> that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change.</li> 
   <li><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales"">Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones</a>, new figures from the ONS revealed. </strong>The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4).</li> 
   <li><strong>Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet.</strong> This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is “past the peak”. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, “Progress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions”.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Face coverings have a “weak but positive effect” in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM’s spokesman told the lobby briefing.</strong> Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn’t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a “personal choice”.</li> 
   <li><strong>Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic.</strong> The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. </li>

  <p>The UK health secretary, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock"">Matt Hancock</a>, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated.</p> 
  <p>In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611.</p> 
  <p>“I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,” he said. “I can announce that we have met our goal.”</p> 
  <p>Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an “incredible achievement” and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the government’s reach as recently as last week.</p> 
  <p>But earlier on Friday, the <a href=""https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/revealed-how-government-changed-the-rules-to-hit-100000-tests-target/7027544.article"">Health Service Journal</a> (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample.</p>

  <p>The number of confirmed cases among prisons in <strong>England</strong> and <strong>Wales</strong> continues to rise, a daily update from the <strong>Ministry of Justice</strong> shows.</p> 
  <p>As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. </p> 
  <p>A <strong>Public Health England</strong> paper published earlier this week said there was cause for “cautious optimism” across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. </p> 
  <p>But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year.</p>

  <p><em>Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. </p> 
  <p><em>Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff.</p> 
  <p>Work is being done to understand why this is, he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds.</p> 
  <p>The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says.</p> 
  <p>Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds.</p> 
  <p>PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> adds this data isn’t needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do what’s necessary to protect BME workers.</p> 
  <p>And that’s it, the press conference has ended.</p>

  <p><em>Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country.</p> 
  <p>Moving together was the right approach, he says.</p> 
  <p>He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace.</p> 
  <p><em>Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK.</p>

  <p><em>Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield.</p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease.</p> 
  <p>A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says.</p> 
  <p>Everybody is being asked to stay at home so we’re all in the same boat in that sense, he adds.</p> 
  <p>As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration.</p> 
  <p><em>Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says it’s tempting to speculate on this but it’s still too early to say, we just don’t know, he says.</p> 
  <p>The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says.</p> 
  <p>We’ll only lift lockdown measures when it’s safe to do so, he says. As of today, it’s too soon to say.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">No change to how tests are counted, says Prof Newton</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><em>Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. </p> 
  <p>With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says.</p> 
  <p>The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme they’re counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way.</p>

  <p><em>Q. What’s your reaction to the report that you’re twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says this is something we’re worried about and looking at.</p> 
  <p>It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation – these are all being looked at, he says.</p>

  <p><em>Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but haven’t actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? </em></p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests.<br></p> 
  <p>The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS.</p> 
  <p>There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken.</p> 
  <p>That makes up the breakdown of today’s testing figure, he says.</p> 
  <p><em>Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise.</p> 
  <p>You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds.</p> 
  <p><em>Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children don’t seem able to transmit the disease?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> says if a child is symptomatic, there’s no reason to think they won’t transmit like anyone else.</p> 
  <p>The question is for children who don’t have any symptoms who get the virus, he says.</p> 
  <p>How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question we’re still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says this is his understanding also.</p>

  <p><em>Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot.</p> 
  <p>Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds.</p> 
  <p>This is a new priority for testing, once it’s up and running by the middle of the month, he says.</p>

  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country.</p> 
  <p>A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says.</p> 
  <p>Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Newton</strong> says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says.</p> 
  <p>The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds.</p>

  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19.</p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldn’t necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says.</p>

  <p>Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident it’s safe?</p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. We’re not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe, he says.</p> 
  <p>This disease doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. </p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says.</p> 
  <p>The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says.</p>

  <p>The number of tests have increased “dramatically” in the last few days, he says.</p> 
  <p>The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says.</p> 
  <p>Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling.</p> 
  <p>Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. It’s moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards.</p>

  <p>We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down.</p>

  <p>In a race to meet the government’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evening’s deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing.</p> 
  <p>A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for <strong>Great Ormond Street</strong> children’s hospital.<br><br>Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence.

This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week.<br><br>Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults.<br><br>A spokesperson for the hospital said: </p>

  <p>Care workers in <strong>Wales</strong> will each receive a £500 bonus to reflect their “value” during the pandemic, the first minister has announced.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mark Drakeford</strong> said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the “scaffolding” of services across the country.</p> 
  <p>He told the Welsh government’s daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing.</p> 
   <p>This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society.</p> 
   <p>Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage.</p> 
  <p>He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing “exceptional circumstances”.</p> 
  <p>Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Another 352 deaths in England, bringing total to 20,483</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483.</p> 
  <p>The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition.</p> 
  <p>Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England:<br>- 70 occurred on 30 April<br>- 148 occurred on 29 April <br>- 39 occurred on 28 April </p> 
  <p>The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March.</p> 
  <p>NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated.</p> 
  <p>Today’s figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863.</p>

  <p>Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a “promising” treatment for Covid-19.</p> 
  <p>A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK.</p> 
  <p>The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. </p> 
  <p>Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19.<br><br>Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital.<br></p> 
  <p>University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date.</p> 
  <p>Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the study’s chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness.</p> 
  <p>Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early.</p>

  <p>Paul Pomroy, the chain’s boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans.</p> 
  <p>All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast.</p> 
  <p>Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with “contactless thermometers” before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UK’s exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=""https://www.plasticwastehub.org.uk/news/the-environmental-dangers-of-employing-single-use-face-masks-as-part-of-a-covid-19-exit-strategy"">experts have said in a new report</a>, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste.</p> 
  <p>At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UK’s exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work.</p> 
  <p>However expert advice on the use of face masks among<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/should-everyone-be-wearing-face-masks""> the general public has been mixed</a>. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) <a href=""https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2020/apr/28/ministers-split-over-coronavirus-advice-on-wearing-face-masks"">has advised</a> the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection – a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers.</p> 
  <p>But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the “precautionary principle”, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/scientists-join-calls-for-uk-public-to-wear-homemade-face-masks-outdoors"">adding these can be homemade</a> since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths.<br></p> 
  <p>Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used.</p> 
  <p>“If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),” the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems.</p> 
  <p>The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them.</p> 
  <p>“We’d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],” said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks.</p> 
  <p>In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn’t lead people to becoming complacent.</p> 
  <p>“Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,” the authors add. “However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.”</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Government changes how it counts test to hit 100,000 target, report says</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports.</p> 
  <p>Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ.</p> 
  <p>According to the source, the <strong>Department of Health and Social Care</strong> is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people’s homes in its figures – which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab.</p> 
  <p>The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>British Airways</strong>’ parent company has signed agreements for €1bn (£900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports.</p> 
  <p><strong>IAG</strong> said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are “restrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies”, the firm added.</p> 
  <p>IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant"">up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA</a>, representing more than a quarter of its workforce.</p> 
  <p>On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UK’s second busiest airport.</p> 
  <p>In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote:</p>

  <p>Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for <strong>NHS England</strong>, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We know it’s been a high stress environment. We’re planning mental health support right now.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. “The military are very good at this,” she said. </p> 
  <p>Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as <strong>Samaritans</strong>, had been set up to support staff.</p> 
  <p>Responding to MPs’ questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We absolutely have not seen that. We’re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone’s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Early detection is vital for survival.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>There have been no national instructions on screening. It’s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on.</p>

  <p>But whether it is the moment for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stanley-johnson"">Stanley Johnson</a>, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question.</p> 
  <p>Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Sr’s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as “a tireless self-promoter”.</p>

  <p>At her daily briefing, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>’s optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines.</p> 
  <p>The first minister said she was “not convinced there is a huge substantive difference” between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was “choosing to use my own words”. </p> 
  <p>Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated “it is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished”.</p> 
  <p>She also warned: “If we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.”</p> 
  <p>Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this “should not be an exercise in driving up the numbers”.</p> 
  <p>Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: “Yes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions.” She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers. </p>

  <p>A recent survey for <strong>Ipsos Mori</strong> suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities – such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport – if the lockdown was eased.</p> 
  <p>It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants.</p> 
  <p>Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">'Face coverings have 'weak but positive effect' in slowing spread - lobby briefing key points</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Here are the main takeaways from this afternoon’s Downing Street briefing:</p> 
  <p>Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime minister’s spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> told yesterday’s press conference:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice.</p> 
   <p>The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We’re talking about face covering. We’re certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>With the health and social care secretary, <strong>Matt</strong> <strong>Hancock</strong>, expected to host this evening’s daily press conference, the PM’s spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The health secretary’s target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is what’s really important.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>The spokesman also didn’t rule out government support for ailing airlines:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We’ve been clear we’re prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the government’s other business support measures.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Further 40 deaths in Scotland, taking total to 1,515</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. </p> 
  <p>There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. </p> 
  <p>The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. </p> 
  <p>In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. </p> 
  <p>Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UK’s Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day.</p> 
  <p>In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK government’s regional drive-through centres.</p> 
  <p>She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing – all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but aren’t already eligible.</p>

In a nutshell, it’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus.</p>

  <p>The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission.</p> 
  <p>Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures.</p> 
  <p>He said while forward bookings implied there was still “massive demand for travel”, it was vital to plan ahead.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Care home boss blasts Johnson's claim that pandemic is on downward slope</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>One of the UK’s largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>’s claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as “completely shambolic”.<br><br><strong>MHA</strong>, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being “at best disingenuous” when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead.</p> 
  <p>Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday.</p> 
  <aside class=""element element-rich-link"">

  </aside> 
  <p>Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus “no consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents”.<br></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting “the spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority”.<br><br>But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, “in practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus”.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isn’t.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Lords to form Covid-19 committee to scrutinise government's response to pandemic</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the government’s response to the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake “cross-cutting” scrutiny of the government’s response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future.</p> 
  <aside class=""element element-rich-link"">

  </aside> 
  <p>The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lord McFall of Alcluith</strong>, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the government’s response to it.</p> 
   <p>Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them.</p> 
   <p>These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations.</p> 
   <p>I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life.</p>

  <p>High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the <strong>Royal College of Midwives</strong> (RCM).</p> 
  <p>Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services.</p> 
  <p>Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths.</p> 
  <p>She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned.</p> 
   <p>I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible.</p> 
   <p>I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.</p>

  <p>RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance.</p> 
  <p>Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women.</p> 
  <p>She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated “as more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that”.</p>

  <p>Public health campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to keep focus on managing Scotland’s problematic relationship with alcohol, on the second anniversary of the introduction of minimum unit pricing.<br></p> 
  <p>Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the country’s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. </p> 
  <p>Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, “The initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.”</p> 
  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening.</p>

  <p>The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. <br><br>The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a “tight ship” by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. </p> 
  <p>Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. </p> 
  <p>This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. </p>

  <p>Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. <br><br>She told MPs at the health and social care committee: “Broadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.” <br><br>She added: “We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it’s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.” <br><br>When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: “I don’t think that’s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. <br></p> 
  <p>“It’s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing – obviously we need to tailor that to patients’ individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. <br><br>“It’s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.”</p>

  <p>Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through £5.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. <br><br>The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe “lifeline services” because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. <br><br>Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. <br><br>The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. <br><br>The Belfast-London route “would be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers”, the Department for Transport stated. <br><br>Shapps said: “Maintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. <br><br>“We must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and today’s investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.” <br></p>

  <p>When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. <br><br>She said: “A lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. <br><br>“During the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. <br><br>“What we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. <br><br>“Every woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.” <br><br>Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal.<br><br>Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths.<br><br>London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population.</p>

  <p>An online festival is being organised by the UK’s specialist cheese community to urge the public to support small cheesemakers during the Covid-19 lockdown. </p> 
  <p>The <a href=""http://academyofcheese.org/british-cheese-weekender."">event will take place on the early May bank holiday</a> and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan.</p> 
  <p>It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said.</p> 
  <p>Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: “We are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited”.</p>

  <p>David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be “perfectly reasonable” for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. <br><br>Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Every government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so that’s a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it won’t be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit.” <br><br>He added: “You don’t need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. <br><br>“But you certainly can release the lockdown while you’re building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - that’s what most other countries are doing.” </p>

  <p>Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. <br><br>More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. <br><br>There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an “employment catastrophe” as the economy “most affected” by the Covid-19 lockdown. <br><br>The leader of the borough council and the town’s MP have called on the government to take rapid action and “ensure that Crawley’s amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks”. <br><br>The letter states: “It is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. <br><br>“However, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.”</p>

  <p>Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as “impossible”. <br><br>He told the PA Media agency: “Social distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. <br><br>“The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. <br><br>“If you’ve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. <br><br>“It’s just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. <br><br>“So we need a better solution, which means that in a few months’ time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.”</p>

  <p>After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnson’s “past the peak” optimism and Nicola Sturgeon’s far more cautious warnings that it is “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. </p> 
  <p>Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, “I don’t think it is a sufficient objective”.</p> 
  <p>Expect more questions on this at the first minister’s briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a “substantial” update on testing in Scotland.</p>

  <p>More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research.</p> 
  <p>Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences – including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection – when Covid-19 financial protections end.</p> 
  <p>Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not.</p> 
  <p>According to its research, commissioned by Citizen’s Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus. </p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">A summary of the latest developments</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services.</strong> There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT).</li> 
   <li><strong>Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday</strong>. He said that the government will set out a “road map” for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week.</li> 
   <li><strong>Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high – and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown</strong>, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities.</li> 
   <li><strong>Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies</strong> in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. </li> 
   <li><strong>The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities.</strong> The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume.</li> 
   <li><strong>Care homes will be the “epicentres of transmission”</strong> for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director.</li> 
   <li><strong>Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged</strong> or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. </li> 
   <li><strong>The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions</strong> for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis.</li> 
   <li><strong>Britain’s manufacturers have suffered a “collapse” in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown</strong> amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests.</li> 
   <li><strong>Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost</strong> as part of a restructuring of the airline.</li>

  <p>Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were “just a stepping stone” to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. </p> 
  <p>“We’ve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and we’re beginning to test essential workers,” he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Some insights from across the globe</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>• <strong>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817</strong>, according to <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by<strong> </strong>Italy with 27,967.</p> 
  <p>• <strong>Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow</strong> religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. </p> 
  <p>• <strong>Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus</strong>, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the “hysteria” over Covid-19.</p> 
  <p>• <strong>The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed</strong> with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet.</p>

  <p>Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a “success” even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. <br><br>“I think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country,” he told Sky News on Friday. <br><br>“This in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense it’s been a success, but there’s more to be done.”</p> 
  <p>He said that the country now needed to “build some head room” between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. <br><br>“The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isn’t an exact figure as to where the R is - it’s somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9,” he said. <br><br>“We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, there’s some space, some room, for manoeuvre.” <br><br>He added that the government approach was a “cautious easing over time” so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected.</p>

  <p>The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a “Eurovision approach” and making “naive comparisons” between the UK’s and other countries’ Covid-19 deaths. </p> 
  <p>Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I think it’s too early to tell our exact place in the league table. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries"">My article</a> was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say who’s top, who’s second and so on. It’s just not appropriate to do at all. </p> 
   <p>There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying we’re going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate.” </p>

  <p>On the government’s advice, Spiegelhalter said: “It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. </p>

  <p>Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector … and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. “That is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. It’s locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.”<br></p> 
  <p>Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from “stay at home” to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked.</p>

   <p>These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. </p> 
   <p>Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael O’Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Wales leader calls for four-nation approach to end lockdown</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Labour politician said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. </p> 
   <p>We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. I’d like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. </p> 
   <p>But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us.</p> 
   <p>Our efforts over the last week have been directed at working with our trade unions, our local authorities and other stakeholders because you can open up anything you like, but if people don’t think it’s safe to take up what is now available to them, they won’t come.”</p>

At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4). Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is “past the peak”. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, “Progress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictions”. Face coverings have a “weak but positive effect” in slowing the spread of the virus, the PM’s spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isn’t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a “personal choice”. Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. That’s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coronavirus coverage, head over to our global live blog for the worldwide picture. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government has gone well past its goal of 100,000 tests a day to combat coronavirus, but faced claims that the number had been artificially inflated. In his press briefing on Friday at 5pm, Hancock said in the 24 hours up to 9am on Friday there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursday’s figure of 81,611. “I knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,” he said. “I can announce that we have met our goal.” Hancock immediately hailed the outcome as an “incredible achievement” and vindication for his strategy of focusing on a goal that had seemed well out of the government’s reach as recently as last week. But earlier on Friday, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. This is from the shadow health secretary The number of confirmed cases among prisons in England and Wales continues to rise, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Thursday, there were 345 prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 across 73 prisons, a rise of 1% in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 2% in the same period to 371 in 64 prisons. A Public Health England paper published earlier this week said there was cause for “cautious optimism” across the prison estate as deaths and cases were lower than expected. But the same paper warned that some of the measures currently in place would have to continue until April next year. Q. A Nursing Times survey indicates nurses are feeling more anxious at work and their mental health is suffering, what will be done about this in the long-term to retain nurses? Hancock says nurses have shown great bravery during the pandemic. He says increasing the number of nurses is an important part of the plan. Q. Have BAME nursing staff been put at greater risk? Powis says they recognise the disproportionate effect the virus is having on BAME staff. Work is being done to understand why this is, he says. Newton says the virus is present in different ways in different parts of the country, which are comprised of people from different backgrounds. The underlying risks need to be identified and understood, he says. Some ethnic groups have different risks of underlying conditions, he adds. PHE and universities are looking at this, and feeding back to NHS England, he says. Powis adds this data isn’t needed to provide support and specialist assistance is being offered. Local healthcare leaders are being told to do what’s necessary to protect BME workers. And that’s it, the press conference has ended. Q. The impact in Northern Ireland has been lower than in the rest of the UK. Is there any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace? Hancock says the virus has affected different regions differently but the fall has been basically the same throughout the country. Moving together was the right approach, he says. He says he sees the case that could be made for lifting restrictions at a different pace. Q. Would it be better for Stormont to work on an all-Ireland basis to fight the pandemic rather than following the UK lead? Hancock says the relationship with the Republic of Ireland is important but the relationship is intensive within the UK. Q. Can you reassure over-70s they will treated the same as the rest of the population when lockdown is over? Hancock says it was clear from the start that specific groups need to shield. Powis adds that the over-70s can be fit and healthy, not everybody at that age has a chronic health condition or underlying disease. A group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, needed to shield because underlying conditions put them more at risk, he says. Everybody is being asked to stay at home so we’re all in the same boat in that sense, he adds. As the infection rate comes under control going forward, this will be under consideration. Q. Is late summer a realistic timescale for people to be able to make plans to meet up with friends and family or go on holiday? Hancock says it’s tempting to speculate on this but it’s still too early to say, we just don’t know, he says. The five tests are there partly to give people a sense of when we can make those next decisions, he says. We’ll only lift lockdown measures when it’s safe to do so, he says. As of today, it’s too soon to say. Q. A report in the HSJ says tests are now being counted once posted out rather than once the sample has been processed, is that true? Newton says there has been no change to the way tests are counted. With new ways of delivering tests, officials have given advice on how they should be counted, he says. The majority are counted in labs, but for any test which takes place outside the programme they’re counted when they leave the programme, he says. So tests that are mailed out or go out by satellite, have always been counted that way. That’s the way they are counted, have always been counted and were advised to count them by officials. Q. What’s your reaction to the report that you’re twice as likely to die from Covid-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country, what policy implications does that have? Hancock says this is something we’re worried about and looking at. It has a bigger impact on older people, men, people from BME backgrounds, people who are obese, and new evidence from the ONS suggests there is a correlation with deprivation – these are all being looked at, he says. Q. The daily testing figure is a massive increase in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday but haven’t actually been yet returned and analysed by labs? Newton says the NHS and PHE labs across the four nations have done 39,753 tests between them. A partnership with Roche undertook 13,723 tests. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse labs total 79,522, he says. These include drive-through, mobile units and research nurses for the ONS. There were 27,497 home kits delivered, and 12,782 delivered through the satellite process. Under the surveillance tests (antibody testing) there were 3,072 undertaken. That makes up the breakdown of today’s testing figure, he says. Q. How much weight do you put on a South Korean study that suggests you cannot get the virus a second time? Newton says the science on immunity is still emerging and not precise. You would never make a decision based on a single study, he says. These results would need to be replicated elsewhere, but it is surely promising and encouraging, he adds. Q. Was a Public Health England official wrong to suggest that children don’t seem able to transmit the disease? Powis says if a child is symptomatic, there’s no reason to think they won’t transmit like anyone else. The question is for children who don’t have any symptoms who get the virus, he says. How transmissible the virus is in these cases is a key question we’re still learning about, the evidence is still emerging, he says. Newton says this is his understanding also. Q. Can you ensure that health and care workers get priority so they can get tested? Hancock says yes, either through the NHS itself or through the employer route which will give them priority for getting a drive-through slot. Once we have contact tracing in place on a large-scale, we need to test them as soon as possible so they can isolate and not pass on the disease, he adds. This is a new priority for testing, once it’s up and running by the middle of the month, he says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. How do you intend to further develop and extend the testing network? Hancock says very soon we should get the results of surveys to show how many people have the disease across the country. A new lab is coming on stream next week in Cambridge, he says. Capacity needs to focus on care homes to tackle the epidemic there, he says. Newton says the work of the new labs must integrate with the existing structures to help use the new capacity to maximum benefit, e.g. getting results back to GPs, he says. The rollout of home testing will be useful for contact tracing and rapid, he adds. Stuart from Redditch asks if the Nightingale hospitals will be used going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists as we come through the pandemic? Hancock says the Nightingales were designed specifically for patients with Covid-19. Powis adds they were created to provide extra capacity for ventilated patients. They are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose, so they wouldn’t necessarily be appropriate for other uses, he says. They are also there as an insurance policy, he says. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Andrew from Leeds asks if there will be fines if people choose to keep their children off school once the lockdown is lifted and schools have reopened. How will the government make sure the public is confident it’s safe? Hancock says when it is safe to do so, the government will make recommendations on this. We’re not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe, he says. This disease doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults, he says. Powis says the virus affects children much less than adults and the elderly. There have been rare reports about complications in children, which are being looked at, he says. The science is still evolving about transmission in children, but the key thing is the disease is not serious for the vast majority of younger people, he says. Hancock says the decision to close schools was down to the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children, he says. Powis says most people are avoiding contact with vulnerable people, including 84% of adults have only left their for permitted reasons or not left their home. More people (45%) are working from home since the measures were introduced, he says. The number of tests have increased “dramatically” in the last few days, he says. The number of new cases as determined by positive tests have increased in recent days. This should be seen in the context of more testing, he says. Overall, the number is relatively stable, he says, which reflects the number of infections is falling. Hospital admissions have been falling, particularly in London. It’s moving down in other regions too more slowly, but overall the trend is downwards. The number of people in critical care is falling in the four nations, he says. Deaths in all settings is overall showing a downward trend. Prof Powis is going through the slides now. The transmission rate, the reproduction rate, the number of new infections is falling, keeping pressure off the NHS, he says. The five tests for adjusting the lockdown are: the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths reliable data to show rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board PPE and other factors including testing must be in hand with supply to meet future demand a second peak must be avoided as it runs a risk of overwhelming the NHS Prof Newton is speaking now. The decision to enter lockdown was not linked to the lack of tests, he says. Access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would not have made a difference, he says. The decision to enter lockdown would have been the same, and at the same time, he says. We can relax social distancing only when the five tests are met, he says. That means getting the infection rate right down. We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK, he says, to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country. The new NHS app is “making rapid progress”. He encourages people to sign up. Hancock says he knew the goal of 100,000 tests by the end of the month was “audacious”. He says the government has met its goal. The number of tests yesterday was 122,347, he says. The health secretary is speaking now. Hancock says he will talk about testing, after the daily statistics. Now that we’re past the peak, the restoration of NHS fertility services can begin, he says. 177,454 people have tested positive, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital, and 27,510 people have now died across all settings, an increase of 739. In a race to meet the government’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by this evening’s deadline, hospitals appear to have ramped up testing. A reader has been in touch to report a sudden surge in the number of samples arriving for analysis at the laboratory for Great Ormond Street children’s hospital. Demand for tests had been surprisingly low until this week, and staffing was more than halved as a consequence. On Sunday 18 April, the lab apparently received no samples at all. However, since Wednesday the situation has reversed, with technicians now processing as many as 600 samples a day. The Guardian understands that all patients and staff, whether they have Covid-19 symptoms or not, have been encouraged to take the test, along with the families and carers of patients. This follows guidance from NHS England asking hospitals to expand testing to all non-elective (serious and emergency) patients from Monday this week. Testing has apparently included children being shielded from infection on isolation wards. The procedure involves inserting a q-tip shaped swab into the nose, and another into the throat - an uncomfortable experience even for adults. A spokesperson for the hospital said: In line with national guidance we are testing all non-elective in-patients for Covid-19. Where possible we are taking the additional step of testing the parents and carers who accompany them. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will front this afternoon’s daily government news briefing, which is due to begin shortly. He will be joined by Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England. The Premier League’s 20 clubs outlined at a meeting on Friday their determination to complete the season amid the pandemic. Although no decisions were taken on the next steps, the participants are understood to have been pleased with the progress made. A lengthy meeting included plenty of discussion about logistics, including how to lock down grounds and create safe environments, the possibility of playing matches at neutral venues, and protocols around testing, including the regularity with which those should be done. In a statement the league said: The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government’s support. The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers. NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be given roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. The Guardian revealed last week that minority groups were over-represented by as much as 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll. Additionally, 63% of the first 106 health and social care staff known to have died from the virus were black or Asian, according to the Health Service Journal. In this explainer, my colleague Haroon Siddique looks at the figures and explains why BAME people may be more at risk. Care workers in Wales will each receive a £500 bonus to reflect their “value” during the pandemic, the first minister has announced. Mark Drakeford said the payments would be made to around 64,000 care home workers and domiciliary care workers who provide the “scaffolding” of services across the country. He told the Welsh government’s daily Covid-19 briefing on Friday: This payment is designed to provide some further recognition of the value we attach to everything they are doing. This group of people, usually women, often not well paid, are providing the invisible scaffolding of services which support both our NHS and our wider society. Without this small army of people, large numbers of others would not be able to continue to live independently at home, or receive everyday support with basic needs by living in a residential care home. Drakeford noted some of the social care workforce were among the lowest paid in Wales, and that the picture contrasted with the Welsh NHS where there are pay bands, and salaries meet or exceed the living wage. He also called on the UK government to waive tax and national insurance deductions from the one-off payment, on the basis the country was experiencing “exceptional circumstances”. Local authorities are expected to administer the payments but no date was given as to when they will be made. Some mid-afternoon joy. This is from Palmerston, the Foreign Office mouser More than two-thirds of London’s pavements are not wide enough to allow people to follow physical distancing advice to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission, according to new research. Only 36% of pavements in Greater London are at least 3 metres wide, allowing pedestrians to meet the government’s advice for people to stay at least 2 metres apart when outdoors, found researchers from University College London. There are also broad variations of the proportion of pavements wide enough to allow physical distancing in different London boroughs, according to the Streets research group, which includes academics from UCL’s Bartlett school of architecture. The City of London has the highest percentage (51%) of streets that meet the minimum requirement, while Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Newham and Haringey all have the lowest (between 26-28%), according to their analysis. Dr Ashley Dhanani, a member of the project team and a research associate at the Bartlett’s Space Syntax Laboratory, said: While some may opt to walk in the road, this is not possible for people with pushchairs or with mobility impairments. Our research shows that there is an urgent need to reallocate street space in London so everyone can use streets safely. You can download a map of London that shows all the streets where there are at least six metres of non-road space here. These are the streets that have enough space on either side for pedestrians to stay 2 metres apart. NHS England has announced 352 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,483. The 352 patients were aged between 30 and 103 years old, and 18 of them (aged between 43 and 98 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 352 new hospital deaths announced today by NHS England: - 70 occurred on 30 April - 148 occurred on 29 April - 39 occurred on 28 April The figures also show 70 of the new deaths took place between 1-27 April, while the remaining 25 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 16 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks earlier. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. Today’s figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 863. Magdalen College, Oxford did their traditional May morning celebrations virtually this year. Researchers are to launch a new trial of a Japanese-manufactured drug they believe could be a “promising” treatment for Covid-19. A total of 450 hospital inpatients with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease will be recruited to take part in the study in the UK. The randomised control trial will see some receive favipiravir, an anti-viral drug produced by Fujifilm Toyama Chemicals in Japan. Other patients will received a combination treatment of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin, while a third group will be given existing standard care for Covid-19. Chelsea and Westminster hospital and West Middlesex university hospital in London are participating in the trial, which also involves Imperial College and the Royal Brompton hospital. University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium aims to start a trial on up to 200 patients at a later date. Pallav Shah, a professor in respiratory medicine at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and the study’s chief investigator, said the study will target early cases of Covid-19 in the hope of finding a treatment which prevents patients progressing into intensive care, reduces the length of their hospital stay and limits their infectiousness. Patients with symptoms such as breathlessness and a fever will be approached to take part in the study before swab results even come back to ensure treatment can be given early. There have been 18 further deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total deaths in the region recorded so far by the Department of Health to 365. The award-winning Scottish orchestra Nevis Ensemble launched the Living Room Ensemble with the aim of putting together a series of performances by musicians and music lovers from across the country, performing at home and shown online. They asked people to submit videos of themselves playing instruments, banging pots and pans, singing along or dancing to the same piece of music. The finished product is now on YouTube, featuring 160 musicians and singers from 15 countries performing I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by The Proclaimers. Good afternoon, I’m Gregory Robinson, If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I’m @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@theguardian.com. McDonald’s is to reopen a number of UK restaurants for delivery from 13 May after closing all of its sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The locations of the 15 restaurants will be announced next week. The fast food chain has spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites, PA reports. Paul Pomroy, the chain’s boss for the UK and Ireland, said the tests were successful, after the company said it had incorporated feedback from staff after the tests and worked closely with the government and trade bodies regarding its reopening plans. All restaurants will be deep cleaned prior to reopening, with new safety measures such as perspex screens, floor markings and smaller teams. The chain will also serve a limited menu and will not be serving breakfast. Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical-grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with “contactless thermometers” before shifts. Social distancing measures will be introduced for all delivery and service partners including Uber Eats and Just Eat. Pomroy added: Slowly, but safely, we will return to towns and cities across the UK and Ireland and thank you for your continued support as we work through this crisis.” The general public should turn to reusable face masks, not single-use surgical masks, if face coverings become part of the UK’s exit strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have said in a new report, revealing the move would save 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste. At a press conference yesterday, Boris Johnson said face masks could be useful as part of the UK’s exit strategy, suggesting they may help people have confidence in returning to work. However expert advice on the use of face masks among the general public has been mixed. It is understood the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has advised the government there is weak evidence face masks can reduce the spread of infection – a stance similar to that of the World Health Organization and others who say there is little evidence they reduce the risk of a wearer becoming infected. Concerns have also been raised that any recommendation for the public to use face masks could lead to shortages of surgical masks among health and social care workers. But some scientists have said the public should wear masks as a part of the “precautionary principle”, adding these can be homemade since cloth masks are better than no covering in reducing the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths. Now the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub at University College London has issued a report revealing that cloth masks would save vast quantities of plastic, and that washing them means they can be re-used. “If every person in the UK used one disposable surgical mask each day for a year, this would create over 128,000 tonnes of un-recyclable plastic waste (66,000 tonnes of contaminated waste and 57,000 tonnes of plastic packaging),” the report notes, adding that while contaminated waste from medical settings is collected and incinerated, no such facilities operate for the public which could result in public health problems. The report also reveals how the team carried out a careful analysis to explore the scenario with the lowest environmental impact, noting machine washing masks, used in rotation, is preferable to hand-washing, which is an inefficient way to clean them. “We’d recommend that people have four and that they use one a day, [then] they put that one straight in the washing basket and they wash it with their other [laundry],” said materials scientist Prof Mark Miodownik who led the work, adding that he welcomed the local manufacture of such cloth masks. In addition, the report contains advice on how a public campaign could be rolled out, noting it is important the public know how to put on and take off such masks, and that the use of masks doesn’t lead people to becoming complacent. “Single-use PPE undoubtedly has its place, particularly as an immediate measure to protect those at the greatest risk of infection,” the authors add. “However, any wide-scale public policies that are implemented during this crisis will have serious long-term ramifications, not only for public health but the health of the natural environment.” The government has changed the way it is counting the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in a bid to hit its self-imposed 100,000 tests per day target, the Health Service Journal reports. Previously, a test would be counted once the sample had been processed in a lab, but this definition has been changed in the last few days, a senior source has told the HSJ. According to the source, the Department of Health and Social Care is now including tests that have been posted or delivered to people’s homes in its figures – which means tests that are sent to people are counted before the recipient has done their test and returned their sample to the lab. The HSJ understands that up to 50,000 of the tests that will be reported as having taken place on 30 April will actually represent the mailing of, or the agreeing to the mailing of, a home testing kit. You can read the full Health Service Journal story here. British Airways’ parent company has signed agreements for €1bn (£900m) of loans backed by the Spanish government, but the money cannot be used to help its UK airline, which is cutting up to 12,000 jobs, PA reports. IAG said the money could be used to help its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. There are “restrictions on the upstream of cash to the rest of the IAG companies”, the firm added. IAG has not requested a loan from the UK government. It announced this week that up to 12,000 jobs would be lost at BA, representing more than a quarter of its workforce. On Thursday it emerged that the airline may not resume operations at Gatwick, the UK’s second busiest airport. In a letter to staff, the BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, wrote: There is no government bailout standing by for BA. Pilots’ union Balpa has vowed it will fight to “save every pilot job at BA”. This is from the first minister of Scotland Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed the NHS is planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. She said: We know it’s been a high stress environment. We’re planning mental health support right now. She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. “The military are very good at this,” she said. Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff. Responding to MPs’ questions, Murdoch also said that there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm: We absolutely have not seen that. We’re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone’s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less. The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern: Early detection is vital for survival. She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. There have been no national instructions on screening. It’s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on. Lifetime Isas are effectively being unlocked temporarily for savers whose incomes have been hit by coronavirus. The rule changes will mean people can access their funds early without facing the usual hefty withdrawal penalty. The Treasury will legislate for a temporary reduction in the Lisa withdrawal charge to 20% between 6 March 2020 and 5 April 2021. This will generally mean account holders will only have to pay back any government bonus they have received, and they will not have to pay the additional withdrawal charge of 5%. A further 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 925, Public Health Wales said. Another 160 cases were reported, bringing that total to 9,972. It is easy to see why it could be thrilling fiction for our times: it has a mysterious and fatal virus, an epidemiologist hero, a desperate search for a vaccine and murky political skulduggery. It also features a green monkey. But whether it is the moment for Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson, to be pushing his 40-year-old novel for a new release is another question. Nonetheless, British publishers have been invited to consider reissuing Johnson Sr’s 1982 thriller The Marburg Virus, the Guardian has learned. His agent is so convinced of his ability to effectively publicise a reissue that his pitch describes him as “a tireless self-promoter”. The Rugby Football League has been handed a £16m emergency loan from the government to help “protect the entire sport” throughout the pandemic. Many clubs within the professional game had expressed fears that without external financial support the sport faced a bleak future. The RFL chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, has warned clubs not to see the money as a “gravy train” and has made it clear the cash needs to last as long as possible to ensure clubs survive. He said: It’s not about dropping a lump sum in a club’s bank account and telling them to carry on as normal; we have to be far more meticulous. Needleworkers at Exeter Cathedral, the Company of Tapisers, have been making scrubs for the NHS and have completed 10 sets, with another 14 in progress, since beginning production two weeks ago. The group said the biggest challenge had been finding suitable fabric for volunteers to work on, with materials from as far away as Bradford being requested to meet specifications. The Company of Tapisers has been making vestments, kneelers, banners, cushions, and even rugs and ropes at the cathedral since 1933. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was probed about overnight briefings suggesting that Boris Johnson’s optimistic tone yesterday was putting at risk her own message that progress remains very fragile and could easily be reversed if people relax their adherence to lockdown guidelines. The first minister said she was “not convinced there is a huge substantive difference” between what she and the prime minister were saying, adding that she was “choosing to use my own words”. Insisting that she did not want to diminish positive messages from the downward trend in hospital and intensive care admissions, she reiterated “it is too early to say that the light is not going to be extinguished”. She also warned: “If we are premature in these decisions and the virus runs away from us ... it will do even more damage to the economy.” Announcing the increase in testing capacity and eligibility, Sturgeon also underlined this “should not be an exercise in driving up the numbers”. Sturgeon warned the tests can be unpleasant and invasive, especially for frail older people, adding: “Yes, volumes are important ... but these must be clinically-driven decisions.” She said the focus on capacity and objectives of testing was more important than the numbers. McDonald’s has revealed it will reopen its first UK restaurants for delivery on 13 May after shutting sites due to the coronavirus lockdown. The fast-food giant said it would reopen 15 restaurants for delivery only, with the locations of these restaurants being announced next week, after it spent this week testing its operations behind closed doors in preparation to reopen sites. Two-thirds of Britons would feel uncomfortable attending large public gatherings, such as sports events or concerts, a new poll suggests, amid warnings the government’s “stay home” advice might have been “slightly too successful”. A recent survey for Ipsos Mori suggested that more than 60% of Britons would feel uncomfortable carrying out their usual activities – such as going to bars or restaurants, or using public transport – if the lockdown was eased. It suggests the public is nervous about a quick return to normality, with 61% saying they would feel uncomfortable using public transport or going to bars and restaurants. Young people are most at ease with going to bars and restaurants. Thirty-six per cent of 18-34-year olds would feel comfortable doing so, compared with only 22% of 55-75s. The polling comes as Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. At this afternoon’s lobby briefing, Downing Street declined to contradict Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The PM’s spokesman said: There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure that we’re best prepared for a future global pandemic, this work will need to be done with our international partners. Budget airline Wizz Air will resume some flights from Luton airport on Friday with passengers and crew required to wear face masks. The Hungarian carrier will introduce the new hygiene measures when it reopens its base at the airport, including the wearing of face masks, physical distancing between passengers during boarding and an enhanced cleaning regime. Flights are due to operate to Budapest, Lisbon and Sofia on Friday. Other routes, such as Tenerife and Tel Aviv, will resume in the coming weeks, pending travel restrictions. UK lockdown restrictions prevent Britons from being allowed to travel to airports for a holiday. But people are able to fly for other reasons, such as to return home after being stranded overseas or if they are travelling for work. Customers are also being urged to use online services for checking in and making purchases such as additional bags to “reduce non-essential interaction at the airport”, and to use contactless payment methods if they buy anything while on flights. Here are the main takeaways from this afternoon’s Downing Street briefing: Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to use face coverings, the prime minister’s spokesman has insisted at the daily lobby briefing. Boris Johnson told yesterday’s press conference: I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work. But his spokesman said no final decision had yet been taken: Ministers are still considering how we move forward with face coverings, in terms of the precise advice. The advice we have received, based on the science, shows a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from ... asymptomatic members of the public, where social distancing is not possible. And he suggested the prime minister was not referring to medical masks. We’re talking about face covering. We’re certainly not thinking about anything that might take PPE supplies away from the NHS, or care workers, or others. With the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, expected to host this evening’s daily press conference, the PM’s spokesman did not reveal whether the 100,000-a-day testing target had been met. But he said: The health secretary’s target has been very effective in driving up capacity in the system. Capacity is what’s really important.” He confirmed that 81,611 tests had taken place in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday. The spokesman also didn’t rule out government support for ailing airlines: We’ve been clear we’re prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort. Although, he also pointed out the firms are eligible for many of the government’s other business support measures. A brand new edition of the popular Top Trumps card game, honouring Covid-19 key and essential workers, hits the shops on Monday. It hails key and essential workers working on the frontline during the pandemic, from doctors and nurses to less high profile sectors such as pest controllers, midwives and sea merchants. Politicians and journalists are also included. One of the four scoring sections in the new game is “unsung heroes”, where the partners of key workers come out top with a maximum 10 out of 10. Nicola Sturgeon has started her daily briefing by confirming 11,654 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 301 from the day before. There are now 1,809 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 61 from the previous day; of these patients, 110 are in intensive care. The first minister also said that 2,659 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. In the last 24 hours there were a further 40 deaths registered of patients who had a positive test for the virus, taking that daily total to 1,515. Sturgeon also set out a chunk of detail on testing, as promised. Active lab capacity in NHS Scotland is now at 4,350 tests a week, and added to the UK’s Lighthouse lab in Glasgow this means that the country now has the capacity for 8,350 tests a day. In terms of actual tests carried out, a total of 4,661 were carried out yesterday, a combination of 2,537 NHS tests and 2,124 from the UK government’s regional drive-through centres. She also announced a significant expansion in eligibility for testing – all residents and staff in care homes with cases will now be tested. There will also be sample testing in other care homes, access to drive-through centres for the over-65s and those few workers who have to leave home for work but aren’t already eligible. Yesterday we reported that the Children’s Commissioner Scotland and a coalition of charities had written to supermarket chief executives urging them to stop the barring and abuse of single parents shopping for essentials with their children. As of this morning, three have replied to the letter. Marks and Spencer was first off the mark, saying they had given “clear guidance...that it may be necessary for parents to bring their children shopping with them and under no circumstances should a family be turned away”. Co-op acknowledged the points made and gave assurances for the future, while ScotMid insisted that children would not be restricted in stores. A head of procurement for the NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal. David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital’s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns. Several readers have been in touch about what the R number, or effective reproduction number, of coronavirus means. This piece from our science correspondent Hannah Devlin provides a very handy explanation. In a nutshell, it’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. Heathrow airport has warned that it may soon follow British Airways in announcing mass redundancies unless the government restores confidence by planning for how flying could restart. The chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said physical distancing measures could not work in airports, and common international standards for health controls were needed, such as temperature screening at the entrances to airports and the wearing of face masks throughout the process to ensure a low risk of transmission. Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, and Holland-Kaye urged the government to take a lead in developing a global agreement for new measures. He said while forward bookings implied there was still “massive demand for travel”, it was vital to plan ahead. Full story here: One of the UK’s largest providers of care homes, which has lost more than 300 residents to Covid-19, has responded angrily to Boris Johnson’s claim the pandemic is on a downward slope, saying this is not true in care homes and lambasting the newly announced testing regime as “completely shambolic”. MHA, which has 222 facilities, said the prime minister was being “at best disingenuous” when he told the Downing Street press briefing the UK had come through the peak and there was sunlight ahead. Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of the network, said: We are now 43 days in from lockdown, yet still our residents and staff have not received the enhanced level of protection that they need. The government will be held to account for this. Confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths in care homes have been running at around 2,400 a week, according to official figures published on Tuesday. Monaghan said that despite nursing dementia homes being by far the worst hit by the virus “no consideration has been given to prioritising tests for those settings, nor the suitability of administering tests to our residents”. This cannot surely be beyond the ability of our policymakers, scientists and government. We said weeks ago that we were being treated as the poor relations to the NHS and the situation, despite our protestations, has not improved. On Tuesday, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the rollout of testing of all residents and staff in care homes in England, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms, insisting “the spread of the virus though care homes is absolutely a top priority”. But Monaghan said that while the long-called-for policy was laudable, “in practice it remains completely shambolic, with many staff and residents unable to secure tests, inconsistencies between the nations, leaving homes unable to effectively control the virus”. We cannot and will not accept assumptions that higher rates of death in care homes is somehow inevitable. With the right support, it isn’t. Peers have announced plans to form a Covid-19 committee to scrutinise the government’s response to the pandemic. A report by the Lords liaison committee recommended the new Covid-19 committee should undertake “cross-cutting” scrutiny of the government’s response, developing understanding of the lessons learned and how they can be applied in the future. The recommendation to establish the new committee will be put to a motion for agreement in the House of Lords. Members will then be appointed to the committee in the coming weeks. Lord McFall of Alcluith, the senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords, said: This is the first time either house has sought to establish a new committee dedicated to the Covid-19 emergency and the government’s response to it. Two key strengths of Lords committees are their cross-cutting nature, they are thematic in approach rather than set up to shadow government departments, and the real world experience our members can bring to them. These strengths will be much in evidence in the new Covid-19 committee which will be made up of experts across a whole range of relevant professional backgrounds and be free to consider all the aspects and impact of the current crisis, including on the economy, education and the social bonds between generations. I firmly believe the new committee will have a key role to play in ensuring we learn the right lessons from the crisis and understand to the fullest extent its effects upon our society, economy and way of life. Downing Street said the prime minister Boris Johnson chaired the daily Covid-19 meeting on Friday. Number 10 said the the government would announce that the Rugby Football League will receive a £16m cash injection “to safeguard the immediate future of clubs in England”. A spokesman said: The emergency loan will help the sport deal with the extreme financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak while the season remains suspended, due to social distancing measures. High-risk pregnancies may be missed during the coronavirus pandemic because expectant mothers are too scared to pick up the phone to their midwife, according to Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). Anxiety in the pregnant population is becoming more pronounced during the Covid-19 outbreak, a committee was told, with an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services. Walton told MPs she was concerned this may be a factor which could lead to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. She told the Commons health and social care committee messaging is key in ensuring women come forward if they need help: Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible. RCM members have reported many patients becoming more anxious during the pandemic, she added, emphasising the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. Walton also said she was concerned about the apparent disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME staff and pregnant women. She said expectant mothers from BAME backgrounds should be treated “as more vulnerable than the general population and midwives are aware of that”. Home births have faced the biggest impact from the pandemic, she said, with services disrupted due to reasons including staffing issues and paramedic ambulance capacity. She said returning to home births would require risk assessments, the return of staffing and testing of women in the community who want to have a baby at home. Olivia Strong, founder of the Run for Heroes 5km Challenge, which has raised £5m for NHS charities, has received the prime minister’s daily Point of Light award. In a personal letter to Olivia, Boris Johnson wrote: As we persevere with the restrictions to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have been inspired by the ingenuity of your Run for Heroes 5km Challenge. Using your daily lockdown exercise to run 5K, donate 5 and nominate 5 people, you have raised more than 5 million to support the extraordinary work of our true heroes - the men and women of our unique NHS. With over a million participants from more than 20 countries, you have roused a global movement that has collectively run the entire distance to the moon and back! Thank you for your brilliant initiative and for all that you have done to support our wonderful NHS. Strong said: It’s an absolute pleasure and delight to accept this award on behalf of the whole Run For Heroes community. Not only the amazing people who have helped with the campaign (India, Alice and my family), but everyone who has continued to run, donate and nominate! It’s been so wonderful to see people coming together for such a worthwhile cause! Good morning!

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Public health campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to keep focus on managing Scotland’s problematic relationship with alcohol, on the second anniversary of the introduction of minimum unit pricing. Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut the country’s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases, and bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said, “The initial results from the evaluation of minimum unit pricing are hugely encouraging as studies have found a significant decrease in consumption in the first year compared to England and Wales. However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.” Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening. The number of mortgages being approved to home buyers nosedived to a seven-year low in March. The sharp deterioration happened amid signs that households are running a “tight ship” by making large repayments on other types of borrowing such as credit cards. Figures from the Bank of England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total since 54,341 approvals were recorded in March 2013. The pause button has been pushed on the housing market as people and businesses adhere to lockdown measures imposed on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus. Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. She told MPs at the health and social care committee: “Broadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.” She added: “We had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it’s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.” When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: “I don’t think that’s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. “It’s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing – obviously we need to tailor that to patients’ individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. “It’s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at this point.” Flights between Britain and Northern Ireland will continue to operate through £5.7m of taxpayer funding, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced. The package is being funded by the UK government and the Northern Ireland executive to ensure airports and airlines do not axe “lifeline services” because of the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aer Lingus and Loganair will be subsidised to maintain London flights to and from Belfast City airport and City of Derry airport respectively. The Northern Irish airports involved will also be given funding to provide ground services for the flights. The Belfast-London route “would be at risk without financial assistance given low passenger numbers”, the Department for Transport stated. Shapps said: “Maintaining air links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is vital. “We must ensure that critical workers can continue to fly over the Irish Sea and today’s investment in these lifeline services guarantees that.” When asked about the provision of mental health care for pregnant women, Walton said members of the Royal College of Midwives had reported many patients had become more anxious during the pandemic. She said: “A lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. “During the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. “What we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. “Every woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.” Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance. The chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives has told MPs she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: “Some of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. “I believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. “I do think it’s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.” Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. She added: “One of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.” Residents in deprived areas have experienced double the death rates of those in affluent areas, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal. Of the 20,283 Covid-19 registered deaths in England and Wales to 17 April an overwhelming proportion of fatalities were of people from the poorest areas. The most deprived area had 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people, more than double (118%) that in the least deprived areas, where the rate was 25.3 deaths. London had the highest mortality rate, with 85.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The highest age-standardised mortality rate was in the London borough of Newham, with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Brent, with 141.5 deaths per 100,000 population, and Hackney, 127.4 deaths per 100,000 population. Manufacturing in the UK collapsed in April, hitting levels lower than during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, according to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers’ Index. The index recorded a score of 32.6 for February – anything above 50 is seen as growth – hitting the lowest level since the survey began 28 years ago, in the first significant sign of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Hello everyone, please do get in touch this morning to share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me while I run the live blog. Thanks. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com An online festival is being organised by the UK’s specialist cheese community to urge the public to support small cheesemakers during the Covid-19 lockdown. The event will take place on the early May bank holiday and is being organised by the Specialist Cheesemakers Association (SCA), the Academy of Cheese, the Guild of Fine Food and cheese writer Patrick McGuigan. It invites cheese lovers to stock up on artisan cheese in the lead-up to the festival to raise awareness of the crisis that threatens to wipe out the previously thriving speciality cheese industry. The festival will be free and educational, organisers said. Tracey Colley, director of the Academy of Cheese, commented: “We are absolutely thrilled to see how many experts from across our industry have wanted to take part in the British Cheese Weekender. From cheesemakers to cheese distributors we now have a multitude of virtual cheese events for everyone to join in with. The Academy of Cheese community of over 2,000 members are busy planning where to buy cheese for the weekend and with so many fantastic artisan cheeses now available for direct delivery they are very excited”. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoy on Covid-19, said it would be “perfectly reasonable” for the UK to start easing the lockdown before a full contact tracing system was up and running. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Every government is having to make a choice and I understand that the contact tracing process is now well advanced and so that’s a reasonable time to be thinking through how lockdown can be eased, and it won’t be eased all at once, it will be eased bit by bit.” He added: “You don’t need to have 100% contact tracing in order to get the R number down. The contact tracing is an absolutely essential part of reducing transmission, and getting that capacity as widely spread as possible is key to getting the transmission as low as you can. “But you certainly can release the lockdown while you’re building up the case-finding and contact-tracing capacity - that’s what most other countries are doing.” Leaders of the UK town predicted to suffer the biggest economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic have issued an urgent plea for help from the government. More than 50% of jobs in Crawley are at risk of being lost or furloughed, according to a recent report. There are fears that the West Sussex town, located close to Gatwick airport, could experience an “employment catastrophe” as the economy “most affected” by the Covid-19 lockdown. The leader of the borough council and the town’s MP have called on the government to take rapid action and “ensure that Crawley’s amazing economic success, built up over many decades, is not lost in a matter of weeks”. The letter states: “It is quite clear that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the national economy and indeed the world economy is unprecedented. “However, due to the business sectors located within the town, and the proportion of local jobs and economic output from these sectors, Crawley is undeniably being hit far harder than any other part of the United Kingdom.” Heathrow’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has described social distancing at airports as “impossible”. He told the PA Media agency: “Social distancing does not work in any form of public transport, let alone aviation. “The constraint is not about how many people you can fit on a plane, it will be how many people you can get through an airport safely. “If you’ve ever been on holiday from Gatwick, you cannot imagine going through there and socially distancing in the summer. “It’s just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport. The same applies with trains and tube stations. “So we need a better solution, which means that in a few months’ time, when the disease is under control and with a low risk of infection, we can make it as low risk as possible for people to fly.” After the striking difference in tone yesterday between Boris Johnson’s “past the peak” optimism and Nicola Sturgeon’s far more cautious warnings that it is “not safe” to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet, there are reports this morning of concerns within the Scottish government that Johnson risks jeopardising progress by suggesting that the worst is over. Scottish government sources have likewise raised doubt about an apparent shift in UK strategy after the wording of one of the five tests was tweaked to remove references to a second peak. While the UK government has denied that this was a meaningful change, Sturgeon said at her press conference yesterday that she was still trying to ascertain whether it was a significant shift, and that it was not one she agreed with, stating that while not overwhelming the NHS was a critical and necessary objective, “I don’t think it is a sufficient objective”. Expect more questions on this at the first minister’s briefing this lunchtime, when she has also promised to give a “substantial” update on testing in Scotland. Coronavirus has killed tens of thousands of people in the UK. Each death is a person who was loved by someone. Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin is writing tributes for those who died during the pandemic. Please email her (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) if you want to share your memories of someone who has passed away. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said: It’s a personal choice, if you have a face mask it’s your choice whether you want to use them and if you walk around some of our towns and cities today you are seeing more people using them than ever before. The advice today is that the difference made by a face covering is quite modest - it doesn’t make a huge difference but it does make some. So it’s your choice. More than 13 million people have already been unable to pay, or expect to be unable to pay, at least one bill because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to research. Of these, almost 11 million have missed or expect to miss a bill that would leave them vulnerable to severe consequences – including eviction, bailiff enforcement or disconnection – when Covid-19 financial protections end. Some sectors, including energy, water and mortgages, have established frameworks for helping people out of debt in a sustainable way. Others, including the private rented sector and local authorities, do not. According to its research, commissioned by Citizen’s Advice and conducted by Opinium among 2,016 nationally representative UK adults, those most at risk of severe consequences include 2.6 million private renters who have missed a rent payment already or expect to do so owing to coronavirus. Morning everyone and welcome to the Guardian’s UK live blog. As ever, please do get in touch while I work this morning. It’s always really useful to get any insight and news tips from readers. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com This morning the Commons Health Committee will hear evidence on core NHS and care services. There will later be a World Health Organisation briefing on Covid-19 and the usual 5pm (GMT) Downing Street press conference. Briefing in Wales and Scotland expected are expected at 12.30 pm (GMT). Britain has passed the peak of coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday. He said that the government will set out a “road map” for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions next week. Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high – and some are also bearing the economic brunt of the lockdown, a study has found. Stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. NHS England figures published last week showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number among the majority white British population. However, unlike previous analysis, the IFS research, published on Friday, strips out the role of age, gender and geography and shows that they do not explain the disparities. Victims of domestic abuse will be able to seek help in Boots pharmacies in a bid to make it easier for them to access support during the coronavirus lockdown. The coronavirus crisis has sparked a huge increase in people using food banks for essential supplies, according to charities. The Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. Care homes will be the “epicentres of transmission” for coronavirus spreading back into society, according to a report quoting a senior NHS England director. Disabled people are struggling to get supermarket delivery slots and are being judged or challenged when they go out to buy food, according to a charity. The government is being urged to deliver pay rises and better conditions for the millions of people who are working through the Covid-19 crisis. Britain’s manufacturers have suffered a “collapse” in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests. Ryanair has said it expects up to 3,000 jobs to be lost as part of a restructuring of the airline. Jenrick later told BBC Breakfast that the number of tests carried out were “just a stepping stone” to more and that the foundations were in place for a strong national testing network. “We’ve got labs across the country producing the equipment at pace and we’re beginning to test essential workers,” he said, adding that local government workers could now also apply for tests. • The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by Italy with 27,967. • Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. • Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the “hysteria” over Covid-19. • The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country’s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought government testing for coronavirus will have been a “success” even if the target of 100,000 tests is not met later today. “I think we will either have met it or be very close, and in that sense the target will have succeeded because it will have galvanised people across government, in the private sector and across the country,” he told Sky News on Friday. “This in itself is just a stepping stone, we need to go beyond 100,000, but we have seen now a very substantial increase in testing in quite a short period of time, so in that sense it’s been a success, but there’s more to be done.” He said that the country now needed to “build some head room” between the rate of infection (R) and one before lockdown measures could be eased. “The R [value] is still below one but we need to build some head room, there isn’t an exact figure as to where the R is - it’s somewhere, the chief medical officer tells us, between 0.6 and 0.9,” he said. “We want to bring R down further than it is today and that matters so that the NHS has sufficient capacity, so that when we do start to ease the lockdown, there’s some space, some room, for manoeuvre.” He added that the government approach was a “cautious easing over time” so that such headroom for the NHS could be maintained and protected. The statistician Sir David John Spiegelhalter warned against taking a “Eurovision approach” and making “naive comparisons” between the UK’s and other countries’ Covid-19 deaths. Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, the Cambridge University professor said: I think it’s too early to tell our exact place in the league table. My article was arguing against this almost Eurovision approach of trying to say who’s top, who’s second and so on. It’s just not appropriate to do at all. There are so many variabilities about how people record Covid deaths - even what the correct metric is for measuring the impact of the epidemic - that to start saying we’re going to be worse or whatever is completely inappropriate.” On the government’s advice, Spiegelhalter said: “It’s much harder to frighten to people to stay at home than it is to reassure them they can go out again. Maybe our whole campaign has been, if anything, slightly too successful. Jeremy Hunt said that the coronavirus outbreak has showed the importance of the social care sector and the need for funding. Speaking on the BBC Today programme and, the chair of the health and social care select committee said: If there is one thing this terrible crisis has brought home to us it is importance of the social care sector … and the crucial work done by those who care for them. They put lives at risk as NHS workers do, and often for low pay. So I will be asking for proper settlement for the social care sector... and the government will want to do that. He said that testing in the community, as has been done in South Korea, will be key. “That is what they did in South Korea so they could stop the virus in its track. It’s locking down the people who might have the virus but not locking down the whole economy.” Hunt said that contract tracing would need to be done through a combined method of technology and also people going door to door. He added that there would be a time when the government would need to change its messaging from “stay at home” to encourage people back out, but to date their approach has worked. Ryanair announced the planned job cuts as it revealed it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June. It said in a statement: As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair Airlines and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group CEO Michael O’Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll begin with a little brightness today, and share an image I was sent yesterday after my shift ended of a rainbow over London. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford has said he does not think certain parts of the UK should come out of lockdown before others. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Labour politician said: I agree with the prime minister, I am in favour of a four-nation approach. We went into lockdown together on the same terms, on the same day. I’d like to see us come out of lockdown on the same basis. But we will use the powers we have to fine-tune the arrangements to make them right for Wales.” He added: As we move to open up things again, we will be careful and cautious, we will have to take people with us.

Last Saturday Wycombe Wanderers were due to travel to Burton Albion but, with every Football League match suspended until April owing to coronavirus, David Wheeler ended up spending 90 minutes not on the pitch but on the sofa, bingeing on episodes of All or Nothing, a behind-the-scenes docu‑series centred on Manchester City. “You train nearly every day for 10 months of the year, so geared towards a particular goal and, especially for the teams that are at the top end or bottom end of the table, it’s very high-emotion, high levels of dedication and concentration at this point of the season and so for it to be frozen in time is very, very strange,” the 29-year-old winger says.</p> <p>Wycombe are eighth in League One but three points off an automatic promotion place with the climax of a unique season still to play out. Some clubs have shut up shop, leaving players to train in isolation, some are training sporadically after deep cleans, having introduced stringent measures on hygiene, particularly in gym areas, while for others it is close to business as usual as they await further government advice or updates from the game’s governing bodies.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/stevenage-stenhousemuir-football-clubs-coronavirus"">\'It\'s our time to give back\': football rallies to fight coronavirus depression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s a waiting game,” says Wheeler. “As a professional athlete you get itchy feet having a few hours indoors – let alone days on end. It is very difficult to stay fit in relevance to football, because you can go for a jog but it’s not the same as football fitness. The way it is looking, with the amount of time we’re going to be off, I’d imagine for health and safety of the players, we’re going to have to have almost a mini pre-season before we set up for the last games because otherwise people will pick up muscle injuries from muscle wastage from sitting around for so long.”</p> <p>Football, and indeed sport, did not seem to wake up to the crisis until the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league"" title="""">tested positive for the virus</a> – “there was a definite gear change when that happened, which is ridiculous” – and, even then, some National League games <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/15/fylde-part-of-english-football-coronavirus-enforced-last-stand"" title="""">continued to be played</a> in front of, in many cases, increased crowds. “It was pretty staggering that some non-league clubs were still playing when the league clubs had decided it was too dangerous. I think it comes from the top and the decision needs to be taken out of people’s hands. It’s like with cafes, pubs and restaurants: the government has told everyone to not go but they haven’t said ‘you have to shut’ so businesses will go under unless they change tack and do something about it.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f5e7faeaa9d6749226a24c3422537f413c550e71""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f5e7faeaa9d6749226a24c3422537f413c550e71/0_170_4145_2487/1000.jpg"" alt=""Wycombe v Ipswich"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">David Wheeler celebrates his goal in the 1-1 draw against Ipswich on New Year’s Day.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boredom does not concern Wheeler, a sports science graduate from Brunel University who arrived in professional football aged 22 at Exeter City after playing part-time for Lewes and Staines Town – “I’ve got loads of books on backlog to read and films to watch” – but he believes the absence of matches and formal training schedules could seriously affect others. “You almost lose your purpose a little bit, because there’s no direction to what you’re doing at the minute. There is often a lot of talk about players that get injured or are not involved that spend days on end sitting at home and end up getting hooked on gambling or other addictions. If they thought it was bad before, it is going to be a hell of a lot worse in the next few months. Are the players really being looked after? I would argue a lot more can be done. I would argue that it’s way past the need for more mental‑health provision and psychological help to players within clubs.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>With the NHS, it is going to expose the underfunding and understaffing when the going gets tough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wheeler is at pains to point out that drawing parallels between the National Health Service and football would be wrong but believes there is a concerning theme of papering over the cracks. “With the NHS, it [the impact of coronavirus] is going to expose the underfunding and understaffing when the going gets tough and, when things get really bad, that’s going to be exposed. Cracks are going to be exposed and expand in this crisis, and you’re going to see that in probably every industry but the NHS is going to be the most stark because people’s lives are at stake but I think you will see that in every industry where there is any vulnerability. I quite like the phrase ‘fix the roof while the sun is shining’ and to fund the NHS to a better degree than it has been would have insulated the potential casualties we’ll see in coming months.

Last Saturday Wycombe Wanderers were due to travel to Burton Albion but, with every Football League match suspended until April owing to coronavirus, David Wheeler ended up spending 90 minutes not on the pitch but on the sofa, bingeing on episodes of All or Nothing, a behind-the-scenes docu‑series centred on Manchester City. “You train nearly every day for 10 months of the year, so geared towards a particular goal and, especially for the teams that are at the top end or bottom end of the table, it’s very high-emotion, high levels of dedication and concentration at this point of the season and so for it to be frozen in time is very, very strange,” the 29-year-old winger says. Wycombe are eighth in League One but three points off an automatic promotion place with the climax of a unique season still to play out. Some clubs have shut up shop, leaving players to train in isolation, some are training sporadically after deep cleans, having introduced stringent measures on hygiene, particularly in gym areas, while for others it is close to business as usual as they await further government advice or updates from the game’s governing bodies. “It’s a waiting game,” says Wheeler. “As a professional athlete you get itchy feet having a few hours indoors – let alone days on end. It is very difficult to stay fit in relevance to football, because you can go for a jog but it’s not the same as football fitness. The way it is looking, with the amount of time we’re going to be off, I’d imagine for health and safety of the players, we’re going to have to have almost a mini pre-season before we set up for the last games because otherwise people will pick up muscle injuries from muscle wastage from sitting around for so long.” Football, and indeed sport, did not seem to wake up to the crisis until the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, tested positive for the virus – “there was a definite gear change when that happened, which is ridiculous” – and, even then, some National League games continued to be played in front of, in many cases, increased crowds. “It was pretty staggering that some non-league clubs were still playing when the league clubs had decided it was too dangerous. I think it comes from the top and the decision needs to be taken out of people’s hands. It’s like with cafes, pubs and restaurants: the government has told everyone to not go but they haven’t said ‘you have to shut’ so businesses will go under unless they change tack and do something about it.” Boredom does not concern Wheeler, a sports science graduate from Brunel University who arrived in professional football aged 22 at Exeter City after playing part-time for Lewes and Staines Town – “I’ve got loads of books on backlog to read and films to watch” – but he believes the absence of matches and formal training schedules could seriously affect others. “You almost lose your purpose a little bit, because there’s no direction to what you’re doing at the minute. There is often a lot of talk about players that get injured or are not involved that spend days on end sitting at home and end up getting hooked on gambling or other addictions. If they thought it was bad before, it is going to be a hell of a lot worse in the next few months. Are the players really being looked after? I would argue a lot more can be done. I would argue that it’s way past the need for more mental‑health provision and psychological help to players within clubs.” Wheeler is at pains to point out that drawing parallels between the National Health Service and football would be wrong but believes there is a concerning theme of papering over the cracks. “With the NHS, it [the impact of coronavirus] is going to expose the underfunding and understaffing when the going gets tough and, when things get really bad, that’s going to be exposed.

Comparing Covid-19 to a street mugger, the prime minister said that as a result of ongoing lockdown measures, the country has begun to “wrestle it to the floor”, as recorded infection rates and NHS hospital deaths from the disease fall from their early April peaks.</p> <p>Not for the first time in his career, Mr Johnson’s rhetoric was vivid, but it expressed at best a partial truth. Barely 24 hours later, the Office for National Statistics <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight"" title="""">published an estimate</a> by the Care Quality Commission that 4,334 people died from coronavirus in care homes in the fortnight leading up to 24 April.</p> <p>Half of those CQC-reported deaths occurred within the final five days. As the curve of hospital deaths flattens and begins to descend, Westminster’s political energies have moved restlessly on to the question of how lockdown restrictions might be eased. But care workers are bracing for a deadly peak that has yet to come.</p> <p>The struggle to protect the nation’s vulnerable and elderly must not be fought in lonely isolation, out of sync with the national mood. At the Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed that the potential crisis in care homes “was something we focused on right from the start”. But that social care became the forgotten frontline of the coronavirus crisis is generally accepted.</p> <p>This week, we learned that <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8261149/SAGE-warned-Government-early-care-homes-risk-COVID-19.html"" title="""">ministers were warned by scientific advisers</a> in January that care homes would be especially vulnerable to a pandemic. From personal protective equipment to testing, the response from the government to that advice was belated and inadequate. What is urgently needed now is the application of genuine political imagination to mitigate a tragic situation which is moving towards a deadly climax. Care homes need immediate help in three specific areas – medical equipment, human resources and financial capability.</p> <p>The proper provision of PPE for care workers must be made an absolute priority for the government. Access to increased testing capacity, which remains haphazard and sketchy, must be vastly improved. Mr Hancock has announced that care homes will now be able to test asymptomatic as well as symptomatic carers and residents. This is welcome, as is the commitment to publish daily figures on care home deaths. But when some care homes are <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52418630"" title="""">still struggling</a> to perform any tests at all, the promise doesn’t count for much.</p> <p>The National Care Forum, which represents 120 not-for-profit providers, has called for acute care specialists and geriatricians normally based in the NHS to lend their expertise in managing outbreaks. Their knowledge, and the experience they acquired during the early April hospital peak, could be an invaluable resource.</p> <p>About <a href=""https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-28/surge-in-applications-to-work-for-nhs-during-pandemic/"" title="""">25,000 retired doctors and nurses</a> responded to government calls to return to the NHS; their skills would be a vital boost in residential homes. Members of the 750,000-strong NHS “volunteer army”, most of whom have not been called on, could be diverted to perform specific tasks.

Comparing Covid-19 to a street mugger, the prime minister said that as a result of ongoing lockdown measures, the country has begun to “wrestle it to the floor”, as recorded infection rates and NHS hospital deaths from the disease fall from their early April peaks. Not for the first time in his career, Mr Johnson’s rhetoric was vivid, but it expressed at best a partial truth. Barely 24 hours later, the Office for National Statistics published an estimate by the Care Quality Commission that 4,334 people died from coronavirus in care homes in the fortnight leading up to 24 April. Half of those CQC-reported deaths occurred within the final five days. As the curve of hospital deaths flattens and begins to descend, Westminster’s political energies have moved restlessly on to the question of how lockdown restrictions might be eased. But care workers are bracing for a deadly peak that has yet to come. The struggle to protect the nation’s vulnerable and elderly must not be fought in lonely isolation, out of sync with the national mood. At the Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed that the potential crisis in care homes “was something we focused on right from the start”. But that social care became the forgotten frontline of the coronavirus crisis is generally accepted. This week, we learned that ministers were warned by scientific advisers in January that care homes would be especially vulnerable to a pandemic. From personal protective equipment to testing, the response from the government to that advice was belated and inadequate. What is urgently needed now is the application of genuine political imagination to mitigate a tragic situation which is moving towards a deadly climax. Care homes need immediate help in three specific areas – medical equipment, human resources and financial capability. The proper provision of PPE for care workers must be made an absolute priority for the government. Access to increased testing capacity, which remains haphazard and sketchy, must be vastly improved. Mr Hancock has announced that care homes will now be able to test asymptomatic as well as symptomatic carers and residents. This is welcome, as is the commitment to publish daily figures on care home deaths. But when some care homes are still struggling to perform any tests at all, the promise doesn’t count for much. The National Care Forum, which represents 120 not-for-profit providers, has called for acute care specialists and geriatricians normally based in the NHS to lend their expertise in managing outbreaks. Their knowledge, and the experience they acquired during the early April hospital peak, could be an invaluable resource. About 25,000 retired doctors and nurses responded to government calls to return to the NHS; their skills would be a vital boost in residential homes. Members of the 750,000-strong NHS “volunteer army”, most of whom have not been called on, could be diverted to perform specific tasks.

You can read a little more about how and why we’re doing it here. Today’s list covers the weekend, from Friday 27 to Sunday 29 March. Friday 27 March Canada mourns Takaya – the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured the world When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister’s farm. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf. “I’ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.”’ The story of a wolf who became legendary for his resilience and tenderness, and his recent tragic death. John Robbie: ‘The apartheid leaders wanted to kill me with a crossbow’ John Robbie made his name playing rugby for Ireland, the Lions and in South Africa. He toured during apartheid, a decision he considers a stain that will never leave him. In this fascinating interview he tells of how he stayed in the country to play rugby, “living in this privileged bubble”, but began to speak out. Eventually he came to have a popular breakfast radio show in Johannesburg, where he gained a reputation for holding politicians to account and championing the new South Africa. “I have always hoped that my work will go in some small way to atoning for that decision I made coming out here as a player.” Experience: my eight-year-old son drove us down the dual carriageway Weekend magazine’s Experience column has delighted, gripped and engaged readers for many years. Here, Lauren Smith tells of how her son saved both their lives after she had a seizure driving down a dual carriageway. “I gripped the steering wheel tightly, then let go. That’s when we began swerving to the right. Other cars were beeping. We crashed into the central reservation and scraped along it as the car continued to pick up speed.” The Strokes: ‘There was conflict and fear and we got through it’ Interviewing Julian Casablancas a few years ago, Alexis Petridis notes, could be “the kind of event that journalists discussed among themselves in hushed, horrified tones”. Happily things go rather better here, with the band discussing their failure to match their initial success, being more famous outside of America, internal conflict and their new album, “the best thing they have done in years”. 20 of the best travel films When you’re unable to travel, a bit of lateral thinking and a streaming service can be a godsend. Anna Smith brings together 20 films in which the location is the real star, from Rome to the Amazon to the Australian outback. Saturday 28 March Road trips, yoga and LSD with the dentist: what the Beatles did next What happens when you stop being the most famous band in the world? Craig Brown captures Paul’s efforts to live in disguise in France (“It made me remember why we all wanted to be famous”), the night George and John had their drinks spiked by their dentist and a Christmas dinner at Apple featuring the largest turkey in the UK, Hells Angels, 40 children, John and Yoko dressed as Father and Mother Christmas … and a punch-up. Did my son inherit autism from my misunderstood mother? Patience Agbabi’s son Solomon was diagnosed with autism when he was five years old. When first asked the question “Is anyone else in your family autistic?” she dismissed it. Here she speaks movingly of how she came to see her mother in a different light in the wake of the diagnosis. “My mother’s stroke might have been prevented had we considered the possibility that her mind was wired differently. She wanted relationships but couldn’t maintain them. She wanted peace: she has it now. How many more women are out there struggling, undiagnosed?” Blind date: ‘I wish we’d talked more about hot priests’ Blind date is always popular with readers, and deeply read, but there’s something particularly appealing about this column in a world of self isolation. “Would I introduce her to my friends? Yes. I would also like to introduce her to the ghosts in my house for an exorcism.” How Panamanian villagers were left at the mercy of a murderous sect It’s often assumed that readers shy away from trickier stories, but one constant of these lists is how people consistently engage with serious, challenging journalism. “By the time the officers reached the village, the violent ritual at the Nueva Luz de Dios – New Light of God – sect was well into its fourth day. Local villagers, members of the Ngäbe-Buglé indigenous group, are adamant that – were it not for a long history of state abandonment – lives could have been saved.” My favourite game: Cardiff v Coventry at Cardiff Arms Park, 1972 Paul Rees remembers Barry John, “a mixture of Machiavelli and Napoleon”, and how he turned certain defeat into an unlikely victory. “It became clear, as three defenders converged on him, that he was not going to make it but still he went on. At the point just before the three pounced on him, he passed blindly out of the back of his right hand. Chugging up in support, the No 8 did not have to break his stride, only catch the ball with the defence occupied elsewhere.” Sunday 28 March Brought to book: Woody Allen’s memoir is the most damning indictment yet “Barely three weeks since Hachette cancelled Woody Allen’s memoir, the book has been published elsewhere, and confirms that Stephen King, among many others, was right to worry about its suppression. The only person who stood to benefit from the silencing of Woody Allen was Woody Allen.” ‘He didn’t even pretend to let us win’… Growing up with the world’s biggest stars, by their children A host of celebrity children, from John Lennon’s son to Samuel L Jackson’s daughter, recall growing up in the shadow of a parent. These stories take an alien experience that can be difficult to empathise with and render it human and relatable while at the same time casting fresh light on people we think we know well. “By the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father’s work. What I remember most is that my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They were actually my dad’s own shoes. My sister and I were so embarrassed, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they’d probably be worth a lot of money.” Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism – review Like all the best non-fiction reviews, this piece from Andrew Rawnsley captures the essence of a book with concision and builds an argument beyond it. Here he notes that the memoir of Theresa May’s former svengali, Nick Timothy, “reads like an account from a very distant time. This was the era before the 2019 election when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn’t. Before we’d left the EU. Before the coronavirus crisis, the scale of which makes all other politics look exceedingly small and gives a petty flavour to tales of past personality clashes.” A few wise words for my nearly-adult boys Emma Beddington’s thoughts on a universal fear for parents struck a real chord with our readers. “It’s a slow then all-at-once thing, this parenting business. The days felt interminable for years (there was a single afternoon in 2004 when they both had chickenpox that definitely took five years off my life; and time seemed to take on a hallucinatory, elastic quality as my elder son examined every knob and twiddly bit of every train in the London Transport Museum every week for a year), now suddenly there’s no time left.” Exploding the myths behind K-pop Bright and irresistible, K-pop provides the beat to South Korea’s youth culture. But behind the perfect smiles and dance routines are tales of sexism and abuse, says Crystal Tai, in this fascinating look behind the scenes of the country’s best-known cultural export. “At the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music.”', 'charCount': '8063', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/chrismoran"">Chris Moran</a>'}","[{'id': 'world/series/the-antidote', 'type': 'series', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'The antidote', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-antidote', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/series/the-antidote', 'references': [], 'description': '<p>Your five favourite reads that have nothing to do with coronavirus</p>'}, {'id': 'world/world', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'World news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/world', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/features', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/chrismoran', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Chris Moran', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chrismoran', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/chrismoran', 'references': [], 'bio': ""<p>Chris Moran is the Guardian's head of editorial innovation</p>"", 'bylineImageUrl': 'https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411472984898/ChrisMoran.jpg', 'firstName': 'Chris ', 'lastName': 'Moran'}, {'id': 'tracking/commissioningdesk/digital-backbench', 'type': 'tracking', 'webTitle': 'UK Digital Backbench', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/digital-backbench', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/digital-backbench', 'references': []}]",False,pillar/news,News,The antidote: your favourite weekend reads beyond coronavirus,"<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try our list of non-coronavirus articles that our readers spent the most time with</p>","If you’re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try our list of non-coronavirus articles that our readers spent the most time with",Chris Moran,"<figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""9e51a57bc4abf0a641e740f9ada90103084343c0""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/9e51a57bc4abf0a641e740f9ada90103084343c0/0_0_6000_3234/1000.png"" alt=""Five hands counting one to five"" width=""1000"" height=""539"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption""> </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Composite: Eric Asato/Illustration: Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>","<p>In this series we’re listing the previous day’s top articles by reading time.

Today, they’d probably be worth a lot of money.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""93414e218a749b0d0edd7c64630e3c86214735fd""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/93414e218a749b0d0edd7c64630e3c86214735fd/0_603_1324_793/1000.jpg"" alt=""Jeff Bridges"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Allstar/GRAMERCY PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=""element element-image element--thumbnail"" data-media-id=""63a077d54e19227607ac87c2dd26aa255aba2c3a""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/63a077d54e19227607ac87c2dd26aa255aba2c3a/0_0_405_367/405.png"" alt=""3"" width=""405"" height=""367"" class=""gu-image"" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/29/remaking-one-nation-by-nick-timothy-review"">Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism – review</a></h2> <p>Like all the best non-fiction reviews, this piece from Andrew Rawnsley captures the essence of a book with concision and builds an argument beyond it.

You can read a little more about how and why we’re doing it here. Today’s list covers the weekend, from Friday 27 to Sunday 29 March. Friday 27 March Canada mourns Takaya – the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured the world When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister’s farm. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf. “I’ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.”’ The story of a wolf who became legendary for his resilience and tenderness, and his recent tragic death. John Robbie: ‘The apartheid leaders wanted to kill me with a crossbow’ John Robbie made his name playing rugby for Ireland, the Lions and in South Africa. He toured during apartheid, a decision he considers a stain that will never leave him. In this fascinating interview he tells of how he stayed in the country to play rugby, “living in this privileged bubble”, but began to speak out. Eventually he came to have a popular breakfast radio show in Johannesburg, where he gained a reputation for holding politicians to account and championing the new South Africa. “I have always hoped that my work will go in some small way to atoning for that decision I made coming out here as a player.” Experience: my eight-year-old son drove us down the dual carriageway Weekend magazine’s Experience column has delighted, gripped and engaged readers for many years. Here, Lauren Smith tells of how her son saved both their lives after she had a seizure driving down a dual carriageway. “I gripped the steering wheel tightly, then let go. That’s when we began swerving to the right. Other cars were beeping. We crashed into the central reservation and scraped along it as the car continued to pick up speed.” The Strokes: ‘There was conflict and fear and we got through it’ Interviewing Julian Casablancas a few years ago, Alexis Petridis notes, could be “the kind of event that journalists discussed among themselves in hushed, horrified tones”. Happily things go rather better here, with the band discussing their failure to match their initial success, being more famous outside of America, internal conflict and their new album, “the best thing they have done in years”. 20 of the best travel films When you’re unable to travel, a bit of lateral thinking and a streaming service can be a godsend. Anna Smith brings together 20 films in which the location is the real star, from Rome to the Amazon to the Australian outback. Saturday 28 March Road trips, yoga and LSD with the dentist: what the Beatles did next What happens when you stop being the most famous band in the world? Craig Brown captures Paul’s efforts to live in disguise in France (“It made me remember why we all wanted to be famous”), the night George and John had their drinks spiked by their dentist and a Christmas dinner at Apple featuring the largest turkey in the UK, Hells Angels, 40 children, John and Yoko dressed as Father and Mother Christmas … and a punch-up. Did my son inherit autism from my misunderstood mother? Patience Agbabi’s son Solomon was diagnosed with autism when he was five years old. When first asked the question “Is anyone else in your family autistic?” she dismissed it. Here she speaks movingly of how she came to see her mother in a different light in the wake of the diagnosis. “My mother’s stroke might have been prevented had we considered the possibility that her mind was wired differently. She wanted relationships but couldn’t maintain them. She wanted peace: she has it now. How many more women are out there struggling, undiagnosed?” Blind date: ‘I wish we’d talked more about hot priests’ Blind date is always popular with readers, and deeply read, but there’s something particularly appealing about this column in a world of self isolation. “Would I introduce her to my friends? Yes. I would also like to introduce her to the ghosts in my house for an exorcism.” How Panamanian villagers were left at the mercy of a murderous sect It’s often assumed that readers shy away from trickier stories, but one constant of these lists is how people consistently engage with serious, challenging journalism. “By the time the officers reached the village, the violent ritual at the Nueva Luz de Dios – New Light of God – sect was well into its fourth day. Local villagers, members of the Ngäbe-Buglé indigenous group, are adamant that – were it not for a long history of state abandonment – lives could have been saved.” My favourite game: Cardiff v Coventry at Cardiff Arms Park, 1972 Paul Rees remembers Barry John, “a mixture of Machiavelli and Napoleon”, and how he turned certain defeat into an unlikely victory. “It became clear, as three defenders converged on him, that he was not going to make it but still he went on. At the point just before the three pounced on him, he passed blindly out of the back of his right hand. Chugging up in support, the No 8 did not have to break his stride, only catch the ball with the defence occupied elsewhere.” Sunday 28 March Brought to book: Woody Allen’s memoir is the most damning indictment yet “Barely three weeks since Hachette cancelled Woody Allen’s memoir, the book has been published elsewhere, and confirms that Stephen King, among many others, was right to worry about its suppression. The only person who stood to benefit from the silencing of Woody Allen was Woody Allen.” ‘He didn’t even pretend to let us win’… Growing up with the world’s biggest stars, by their children A host of celebrity children, from John Lennon’s son to Samuel L Jackson’s daughter, recall growing up in the shadow of a parent. These stories take an alien experience that can be difficult to empathise with and render it human and relatable while at the same time casting fresh light on people we think we know well. “By the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father’s work. What I remember most is that my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They were actually my dad’s own shoes. My sister and I were so embarrassed, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they’d probably be worth a lot of money.” Remaking One Nation: The Future of Conservatism – review Like all the best non-fiction reviews, this piece from Andrew Rawnsley captures the essence of a book with concision and builds an argument beyond it. Here he notes that the memoir of Theresa May’s former svengali, Nick Timothy, “reads like an account from a very distant time. This was the era before the 2019 election when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn’t. Before we’d left the EU. Before the coronavirus crisis, the scale of which makes all other politics look exceedingly small and gives a petty flavour to tales of past personality clashes.” A few wise words for my nearly-adult boys Emma Beddington’s thoughts on a universal fear for parents struck a real chord with our readers. “It’s a slow then all-at-once thing, this parenting business.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley"">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>M&amp;S said the sanitisers were initially priced at £15 by mistake but the new £11.50 cost is still significantly more than similar products sold elsewhere.

    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak"">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p>“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>
    <p>Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>

<p>M&amp;S said the sanitisers were initially priced at £15 by mistake but the new £11.50 cost is still significantly more than similar products sold elsewhere. Another brand’s bottle of the same amount of hand sanitiser is advertised for sale at Boots for just £4.15 with a different 250ml one priced at £2, while Superdrug offers 300ml of hand gel for £3.49.</p> 
<p>M&amp;S’s pricing has prompted indignation from customers, while Labour’s shadow business and consumer minister, Lucy Powell, warned it was unacceptable for businesses to exploit the pandemic to “line their pockets”.</p> 
<p>It comes after it emerged that the country’s competition watchdog has lobbied Downing Street for emergency powers to crack down on over-inflated prices for key items during the coronavirus outbreak, highlighting that existing laws are not sufficient. The Competition and Markets Authority received 21,000 complaints between 10 March and 19 April related to the pandemic, including grievances about price rises. The average price hike in reports was 130% but in the case of hand sanitisers it reached 367%.</p> 
<p>In recent weeks, shoppers have shared pictures on social media of the Turkish-made “Belux instant hand sanitizer” advertised on M&amp;S shelves, expressing disappointment at its high cost.</p> 
<p>Elaine Hanan, 55, a former CEO who now works as a consultant in the travel industry, only discovered the cost of the hand sanitiser she bought at an M&amp;S in Reigate, Surrey, after looking at her receipt when she arrived home.</p> 
<p>She questioned the supermarket’s integrity over the pricing, sending a message to the firm’s Twitter account last month saying: “I have to say I am in shock. I was delighted to see hand sanitizer... took two, one for me and one for my daughter with a 7 week old baby. Thought bill was high – so checked when home to find you charged £11.50 for ONE hand sanitizer. Where is the integrity?”</p> 
<p>Hanan, who usually lives in Spain but was staying with her daughter to help with her newborn when lockdown hit, told the Guardian: “I was and still am horrified. In Reigate there’s an M&amp;S and a Morrisons, and Morrisons had some hand sanitiser about a week later for half the price.</p> 
<p>“M&amp;S are always good quality but usually reasonably priced. With hand sanitiser, you can’t really improve on quality so they’re not adding any value to the product and the process. It just gives the impression that you’re ripping the consumer off.”</p> 
<p>Another shopper, Paul Anderson, said he “couldn’t believe the price” and tweeted a picture of the hand sanitisers on a shelf on 15 May.</p> 
<p>In March, Boris Johnson suggested the government could bring in new laws to crackdown on profiteering during the pandemic. Labour is understood to be looking at ways to strengthen consumer protection in any upcoming legislation. Powell said: “It’s clear that some businesses are taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to line their pockets. This is unacceptable and companies should behave responsibly. It’s vital that ministers crack down on profiteering during this crisis as the Prime Minister promised, and give the Competition and Market Authority the powers they need to stand up for consumers.”</p> 
<p>James Daley, of consumer campaign group Fairer Finance, added: “You wouldn’t expect a reputable retailer like M&amp;S to be indulging these kinds of low-level tactics. If anything, you’d expect them to be leading the way, perhaps even taking a hit selling things like hand sanitiser as a loss leader trying to help people out at this time. It sticks in the throat a bit.”</p>

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Finally, the FTSE 100 index has closed 68 points higher at 7480, up almost 1% today. That still means it has lost 100 points over the last two sessions, amid coronavirus worries. David Madden of CMC Markets says traders have been snapping up potential bargains after Monday’s rout, and hoping Beijing gets a grip on the crisis: Stock markets in Europe have pulled back some of the ground that was lost yesterday. In relation to the coronavirus, the situation has deteriorated in the past 24 hours as the number of confirmed infections has risen, and so has the number of fatalities. The positive move in equities is probably down to short covering plus bargain hunting as the health crisis has deepened. The longer the news story hangs around, traders might build up a tolerance to it. The Chinese central bank has made it clear it is willing to use monetary tools in a bid to lift economic sentiment, should they feel it is required. The message from Beijing reassured traders somewhat, but the acid test will be whether the rebound lasts or not. Here’s an interesting thread on the implications of the coronavirus, from Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Stock markets are now moving higher, lifted by hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be controlled following Zhong Nanshan’s optimistic comments today. The pick-up in American consumer confidence is also lifting equities, as it bodes well for US economic growth this year. But... the main indices have still only recovered a third of Monday’s losses. FTSE 100: up 61 points or 0.9% at 7,475 German DAX: up 87 points or 0.66% at 13,292 French CAC: up 48 points or 0.8% at 5,911 Wall Street has also opened higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 129 points or 0.45% (it lost 450 points on Monday). Chris Towner, Director at risk advisor JCRA, says investors are trying to get to grips with the Wuhan virus. “With the death toll rising above 100, financial markets are still trying to gauge the potential reach of this deadly virus. By comparison, the SARS virus impacted 8098 people with 774 fatalities. The question now is how quickly can this virus be contained and, in the meantime, how many countries and economies will be impacted? In times of risk aversion money normally floods into the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Due to the proximity of Japan to China the risk of the virus penetrating Japan is high, with one confirmed case so far. Therefore, the Swiss franc is currently seen as the ultimate safe haven and has strengthened by over 3% against the Euro from its pre-Christmas level of 1.10 CHF to the Euro in the 1.06’s, the strongest level since April 2017. Markets will now be focusing on the pace of the spread of the virus and whether there are signs of acceleration or deceleration.” Just in: US consumer confidence has rallied this month, by more than expected. The Confidence Board’s survey of consumer morale has spiked to 131.6, up from 128.2 last month. Americans interviewed for the survey said their current financial situation had improved, adding that they were more optimistic about their future prospects. A top Chinese respiratory scientist has predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus has predicted that the outbreak could peak in one week or around 10 days. Zhong Nanshan made the comments in an interview with Xinhua, the state news media site. They say: “It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases,” Zhong said. Zhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Zhong really knows his stuff -- he was deeply involved in fighting the SARS outbreak back in 2003 (telling reporters that the situation wasn’t under control). So this could be an encouraging signal, if Zhong is right.... But with more cases detected in Thailand today, and a second patient in Germany, the situation is still moving fast. Despite the slump in demand for aircraft, overall US durable goods rose by 2.4% in December. But if you strip out defence kit, demand was slightly lower. That’s a disappointing sign, says Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers: Ouch. We have fresh evidence today that Boeing’s 737 Max crisis is causing economic harm. First up, US aircraft orders plunged by almost 75% in December, according to the latest durable goods orders report just released. That’s the biggest slump in non-defence aircraft orders since 2009, as airline hold off buying 7373 Max jets until the problems that caused two fatal crashes are fixed. This delay is hurting Boeing (which sacked its CEO last month), and also harming its customers. It currently hopes to get the plane flying by this July. Ryanair has warned pilots that it could be forced to close some bases, resulting in job cuts, because of the persistent delays. In a memo, the budget airline told staff it won’t receive its first 737 Max jets until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. It had originally hoped to take delivery last April, boosting capacity on its routes. Back in the UK, some of the investors caught up in Neil Woodford savings scandal have learned how much of their money has been lost. And, as feared, it’s a very heavy blow. Link Fund Solutions, which has been winding up the Equity Income fund, says investors will receive an initial payment of 46.3p and 58.9p for each share they owned in the fund, compared to 100p when it was launched. They should receive a second payment, once the less-liquid assets held by the fund are sold off (although that will be a trickier task). More here: Several companies have instructed some staff not to come into the office Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have visited mainland China to work from home for the next fortnight, Reuters reports. Chinese video games giant Tencent and online retail giant Alibaba are also trying to keep staff out of the office, CNBC flags up: The oil price would probably be even lower, but for ongoing supply disruption in Libya. Libya’s crude output has tumbled in recent days, as the Libyan National Army (based in Benghazi) have blockaded ports as part of their campaign against the Libya’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. This has pulled Libya’s oil production down from 1.2m barrels a day to 260,000 barrels and it could soon all-but run out. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, predicts that Opec (the oil cartel) could soon step in and cut supplies, to prop prices up. “The University of Hong Kong estimates that at least 25,630 people in Wuhan have symptoms of the virus with 44,000 infected with no symptoms yet. This should imply that the sell-off in Brent crude is still not yet over, as the crisis is still intensifying.... On the supply side however, we see that Libya’s oil production will likely be down to zero (from 1.1 m bl/day) within days. OPEC is also following the coronavirus situation closely. It will most likely step in and reduce supply for a month or two in order to prevent an inventory build-up which the market would have to struggle with for an extended period. The oil price is also suffering today, with Brent crude down 1% at $58.88 per barrel. At one stage it touched $58.88, the joint-lowest since October. Analysts at SP Angel Oil and Gas blame the ‘panic’ around the escalating coronavirus, telling clients: The number of casualties in China continues to climb, as do cases of the virus elsewhere in the world The Chinese government has tried to quarantine Wuhan and other cities, affecting tens of millions of people. Multinational businesses in China are also implementing lockdown procedures. Oil demand growth is the biggest factor weighing on prices, China’s oil demand has been growing at an annual rate of 5.5%, while comparatively, US oil demand has been growing by 0.5% Most of the demand loss will come from jet fuel as the risk of disease discourages travellers Back in the UK, retail sales remain flat this month despite the so-called Boris Bounce. Retailers are evenly split between those enjoying stronger sales this month, and those suffering weaker demand. That’s according to the CBI’s monthly ‘distributive trades’ survey, which has come in at zero for January, the same as December. That’s better than November’s -3, and a sharp improvement on the -49 suffered last August (when most shops reported declining volumes). Retailers also reported that sales were poor for the time of year, undermining the theory that December’s general election has brought much cheer. Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, says: “Both official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers. A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon. “2020 looks set to be another tough year for the sector as growth in households’ disposable income is set to remain modest and retailers continue to battle longer-term issues such as digital disruption and the cumulative burden of policy costs. The upcoming Budget provides an opportunity for the Chancellor to support retailers, primarily by fixing the broken business rates system.” Copper prices are also being hurt by the prospect of China’s economy slowing as its government grapples with the coronavirus shutdown. The futures price of Copper is down 0.5% today, and is on track for its 10th daily fall in a row. Copper is seen as a bellweather of the health of the global economy (known as ‘Doctor Copper’ in the City). Fashion chain Burberry is suffering badly from the virus crisis. It’s the biggest faller on the Footsie this morning, down 3.5% at £19.30. Burberry’s shares have now lost 17% of their value since 17th January, just before experts warned that the virus could be much more serious than first thought. Asia is a massively important market for Burberry. Last week, it reported that sales in mainland China had grown by “mid-teen” levels. It has been hoping for a bumper Lunar New Year -- creating a “Ratberry” campaign to piggy-back off the Year Of The Rat. It also planned to take its Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show to Shanghai in April and open our first social retail store in Shenzhen, in partnership with Tencent. Those plans could all be hurt by the Wuhan coronavirus. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, has also been looking at previous viruses such as SARS, for indications of how the Wuhan coronavirus may play out. The lesson, he says, is that markets may tumble in the face of an epidemic-- but they then typically bounce back. “Of course, making any accurate quantitative estimate of what the coronavirus means for global and Chinese GDP growth estimates or what it might mean for financial markets is fraught with difficulties. However, that is the nature of the beast. Equity markets seem to want to believe “good news”. In other words, investors, in the absence of anything else to work on, refer to previous viruses, such as SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, as a template for price action in the markets or in terms of economic developments. The investment message from those episodes is that equity markets can drop 10% or so over a 1-3 month period before strongly bouncing back. Negative effects on economic growth are equally short-lived. For example, developing Asia recovered at an 11% pace after the summer of 2003.” The Coronavirus crisis could drive China’s economy into reverse, fears Freya Beamish. chief Asia Economist at Pantheon Economics. In a new research note, Beamish predicts that China’s “true” real GDP could be flat, or even fall in January-March, due to the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, factory shutdowns, and fearful consumers. She points out that the SARS virus caused a serious slowdown back in 2003, damaging service sector activity and manufacturing output. We reckon the brunt of the damage was done in Q2 2003, when real GDP growth dropped to 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, from an average of 2.8% in the previous three quarters. Growth then rebounded sharply in Q3, to 3.4%, coming off the favourable base of Q2, but again was weak in Q3. Although coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, it may be more contagious -- and Beijing may impose more stringent measures to tackle the virus. Beamish predicts: The bottom line here is that China could even see a contraction in quarterly real GDP growth in Q1, in reality, depending on the timing of factory closures and how long it takes to contain the virus. We are assuming that missed spending will be recouped in Q2, leading to a bumper quarter, though it’s very possible that some of the expenditure on services around the holiday simply will be lost. This means the overall economy may not bounce back in the same way as in 2003. In short, you can make up for factory shutdowns by increasing overtime, but making up spending for a lost holiday is more complicated. And the containment measures could go on for longer than in our baseline assumption. A person in Japan who has not visited Wuhan has contracted the coronavirus, local media are reporting. Reuters explains: Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The infected person is a tour bus driver in his 60s in the city of Nara, Kyodo said. Health Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The European market rally is now fading, as Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam outlines new measures to curb transport between her city and mainland China. Hong Kong is suspending its high-speed rail link with China, and also cutting the number of flights in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Sensible measures, but they also highlight how the epidemic will hurt economic activity in the region. After their worst day in four months yesterday, European stock markets have opened higher this morning. But it’s only a small recovery, given they lost over 2% on Monday. FTSE 100: up 27 points or 0.38% at 7439 German DAX: up 38 points or 0.3% at 13,239 French CAC: up 27 points or 0.5% at 5,891 Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders should await coronavirus developments.... It makes sense to compare and draw some inference between now and the performance of markets during SARS. European equities saw a 20-25% drawdown during SARS. The FTSE 100 is down just under 4% from its recent peak and the DAX has lost under 2.5% so there is plenty of downside risk. Is that size correction likely? The lower mortality rate of the Wuhan virus is a reason for optimism it won’t. But extra caution is needed because China is now much more important to the global economy than it was in 2003. We think it is better to wait for the rise in the number of cases to slow before getting positive about the markets again. We know there is an incubation period of 14 days and the virus can be passed on when the subject is not showing symptoms. Putting that together, we could be on the cusp of a plateau or a massive escalation in the number of cases. MSCI’s index of emerging markets shares has dropped by 0.5% today, amid worries that the coronavirus will hurt global growth. John Velis of BNY Mellon Markets says: With Chinese authorities working hard to contain the spread of the virus, and firms and provinces extending the week-long lunar new year to prevent massive travel volumes at the height of an epidemic, we’re seeing anecdotal evidence of large factories going idle until well after the new year, and foreign companies evacuating non-Chinese citizens. Japan’s stock market has fallen to a three-week low today. The Nikkei shed 0.55%, hurt by coronavirus worries and a rally in the yen (as investors race for save havens). Companies exposed to the Chinese economy did badly, but shares in pharmaceuticals firms jumped. Reuters has the details: Shares of South Korean mask producer Monalisa surged 29%, while South Korean pharmaceuticals Kukje Pharma and Woojung Bio added 29% and 21% respectively on Tuesday. Japan’s Kawamoto Corp, which supplies medical products including masks, saw its share prices tripled, while Japanese protective clothing maker Azearth rose 53% in the past week. Malaysia’s Top Glove Corp has seen its shares surge by a quarter in a week. Several economists fear that the coronavirus will hurt China’s economy -- although there’s uncertainty over quite how bad it will be. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: “The wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.” The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth “The outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,” said Capital’s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. “But it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China’s GDP this quarter.” And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe are focused on one question today -- how serious is the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and what impact will it have on the global economy? Global equities suffered sharp losses on Monday, with Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged over 2% - its worst day since October. Wall Street followed, losing 1.5% as traders fretted that the virus could become a SARS-like epidemic proportions. Overnight, the death toll from the virus hit 106, with more than 4,515 cases of the illness now been recorded across China. The first death has been reported in Beijing, highlighting how the virus has spread beyond the city of Wuhan. This has prompted losses in some Asia-Pacific market today, particularly in markets which were closed on Monday. South Korea’s KOSPI 200 index has been badly buffeted, losing 3% during Tuesday’s session, while Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.35% , with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards. Australia’s economy is tightly linked to China, providing the coal and iron ore needed to sustain the Chinese economy. But it’s hard to assess quite how much economic damage coronavirus could cause. My colleague Ben Butler reports: “We haven’t got enough information,” the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a “mild” pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia’s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. China’s stock markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year - preventing traders in Shanghai, Shenzhen or Beijing from selling stocks. Europe’s stock markets may recover today - the FTSE 100 just opened 38 points higher (having lost 173 on Monday). But any signs that the virus is spreading faster or claiming more lives could send stocks down again. Part of the problem, bluntly, is that pneumonia pandemics aren’t well understood in the City. Investors have been swotting up fast about incubation times, mortality rates and infectious control -- but it’s still hard to plug this public health crisis into a classic trading mode. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: The problem is investors have very limited visibility of the current situation in China, have virtually zero knowledge of epidemiology and virology, and have no clue how bad it will get or lasting the impact will be. Risk models are not geared for this situation. Here’s a pithier take: Also coming up today A new healthcheck on Britain’s retail sector is expected to show a pick-up in spending this month, as confidence rises following December’s general election. New economic surveys from the US could show a rise in durable goods orders, and consumer confidence. However, such data could soon be overtaken by concerns over the coronavirus. The agenda 11am GMT: CBI index of UK retail sales for January. Forecast to rise to +4. from 0 1.30pm GMT: US durable goods orders for December. Forecast to rise by 0.9%, from -2.1% 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence index for January.

  <p><strong>Finally, the FTSE 100 index has closed 68 points higher at 7480, up almost 1% today.</strong></p> 
  <p>That still means it has lost 100 points over the last two sessions, amid coronavirus worries.</p> 
  <p>David Madden of CMC Markets says traders have been snapping up potential bargains after Monday’s rout, and hoping Beijing gets a grip on the crisis:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Stock markets in Europe have pulled back some of the ground that was lost yesterday. In relation to the coronavirus, the situation has deteriorated in the past 24 hours as the number of confirmed infections has risen, and so has the number of fatalities. The positive move in equities is probably down to short covering plus bargain hunting as the health crisis has deepened. The longer the news story hangs around, traders might build up a tolerance to it.</p> 
   <p>The Chinese central bank has made it clear it is willing to use monetary tools in a bid to lift economic sentiment, should they feel it is required. The message from Beijing reassured traders somewhat, but the acid test will be whether the rebound lasts or not. </p>

  <p><strong>Chris Towner,</strong> Director at risk advisor <strong>JCRA</strong>, says investors are trying to get to grips with the Wuhan virus.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p> “With the death toll rising above 100, financial markets are still trying to gauge the potential reach of this deadly virus. By comparison, the SARS virus impacted 8098 people with 774 fatalities. The question now is how quickly can this virus be contained and, in the meantime, how many countries and economies will be impacted? In times of risk aversion money normally floods into the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.</p> 
   <p>Due to the proximity of Japan to China the risk of the virus penetrating Japan is high, with one confirmed case so far. Therefore, the Swiss franc is currently seen as the ultimate safe haven and has strengthened by over 3% against the Euro from its pre-Christmas level of 1.10 CHF to the Euro in the 1.06’s, the strongest level since April 2017. </p> 
   <p>Markets will now be focusing on the pace of the spread of the virus and whether there are signs of acceleration or deceleration.” </p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Chinese expert: Outbreak could peak in 10 days</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>A top Chinese respiratory scientist has predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus has predicted that the outbreak could peak in one week or around 10 days.</strong></p> 
  <p>Zhong Nanshan made the comments in <a href=""http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/28/c_138739773.htm"">an interview with Xinhua</a>, the state news media site.</p> 
  <p>They say:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases,” Zhong said.</p> 
   <p>Zhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Zhong really knows his stuff -- he was deeply involved in fighting the SARS outbreak back in 2003 (<a href=""https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/china-sars-fighter-returns-to-battle-coronavirus/5257570.html"">telling reporters that the situation wasn’t under control</a>). So this could be an encouraging signal, if Zhong is right....</p> 
  <p>But with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates"">more cases detected in Thailand today, and a second patient in Germany, the situation is still moving fast</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Ouch. We have fresh evidence today that Boeing’s 737 Max crisis is causing economic harm.</strong></p> 
  <p>First up, US aircraft orders plunged by almost 75% in December, according to the latest durable goods orders report just released.</p> 
  <p>That’s the biggest slump in non-defence aircraft orders since 2009, as airline hold off buying 7373 Max jets until the problems that caused two fatal crashes are fixed.</p> 
  <p>This delay is hurting Boeing (which sacked its CEO last month), and also harming its customers. It currently hopes to get the plane flying by this July.</p> 
  <p>Ryanair has warned pilots that it could be forced to close some bases, resulting in job cuts, because of the persistent delays.</p> 
  <p>In a memo, the budget airline told staff it won’t receive its first 737 Max jets until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. It had originally hoped to take delivery last April, boosting capacity on its routes.</p>

  <p><strong>The oil price would probably be even lower, but for ongoing supply disruption in Libya.</strong></p> 
  <p>Libya’s crude output has tumbled in recent days, as the Libyan National Army (based in Benghazi) have blockaded ports as part of their campaign against the Libya’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord.</p> 
  <p>This has pulled Libya’s oil production down from 1.2m barrels a day to 260,000 barrels and it could soon all-but run out.</p>

   <p>On the supply side however, we see that Libya’s oil production will likely be down to zero (from 1.1 m bl/day) within days. OPEC is also following the coronavirus situation closely. It will most likely step in and reduce supply for a month or two in order to prevent an inventory build-up which the market would have to struggle with for an extended period.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">UK retail sales remain subdued</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>Back in the UK, retail sales remain flat this month despite the so-called Boris Bounce.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>Retailers are evenly split between those enjoying stronger sales this month, and those suffering weaker demand.<br></p> 
  <p>That’s according to the CBI’s monthly ‘distributive trades’ survey, which has come in at zero for January, the same as December.</p> 
  <p>That’s better than November’s -3, and a sharp improvement on the -49 suffered last August (when most shops reported declining volumes).</p> 
  <p>Retailers also reported that sales were poor for the time of year, undermining the theory that December’s general election has brought much cheer.</p> 
  <p><strong>Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, says:</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p><strong>“</strong>Both official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers. A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon.</p> 
   <p>“2020 looks set to be another tough year for the sector as growth in households’ disposable income is set to remain modest and retailers continue to battle longer-term issues such as digital disruption and the cumulative burden of policy costs. The upcoming Budget provides an opportunity for the Chancellor to support retailers, primarily by fixing the broken business rates system.”</p>

  <p>It’s the biggest faller on the Footsie this morning, down 3.5% at £19.30. Burberry’s shares have now lost 17% of their value since 17th January, just before <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/corona-second-death-in-china-after-sars-like-outbreak"">experts warned that the virus could be much more serious than first thought</a>.</p> 
  <p>Asia is a massively important market for Burberry. Last week, it reported that sales in mainland China had grown by “mid-teen” levels. It has been hoping for a bumper Lunar New Year -- creating a “Ratberry” campaign to piggy-back off the Year Of The Rat.</p> 
  <p>It also planned to take its Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show to Shanghai in April and open our first social retail store in Shenzhen, in partnership with Tencent. Those plans could all be hurt by the Wuhan coronavirus. </p>

  <p><strong>Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, has also been looking at previous viruses such as SARS, for indications of how the Wuhan coronavirus may play out.</strong></p> 
  <p>The lesson, he says, is that markets may tumble in the face of an epidemic-- but they then typically bounce back.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“Of course, making any accurate quantitative estimate of what the coronavirus means for global and Chinese GDP growth estimates or what it might mean for financial markets is fraught with difficulties. However, that is the nature of the beast. Equity markets seem to want to believe “good news”.</p> 
   <p>In other words, investors, in the absence of anything else to work on, refer to previous viruses, such as SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, as a template for price action in the markets or in terms of economic developments. The investment message from those episodes is that equity markets can drop 10% or so over a 1-3 month period before strongly bouncing back. Negative effects on economic growth are equally short-lived. For example, developing Asia recovered at an 11% pace after the summer of 2003.”</p>

  <p>Although coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, it may be more contagious -- and Beijing may impose more stringent measures to tackle the virus.</p> 
  <p>Beamish predicts:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The bottom line here is that China could even see a contraction in quarterly real GDP growth in Q1, in reality, depending on the timing of factory closures and how long it takes to contain the virus.</p> 
   <p>We are assuming that missed spending will be recouped in Q2, leading to a bumper quarter, though it’s very possible that some of the expenditure on services around the holiday simply will be lost. This means the overall economy may not bounce back in the same way as in 2003. In short, you can make up for factory shutdowns by increasing overtime, but making up spending for a lost holiday is more complicated. And the containment measures could go on for longer than in our baseline assumption.</p>

  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p><strong>It makes sense to compare and draw some inference between now and the performance of markets during SARS.</strong> European equities saw a 20-25% drawdown during SARS. The FTSE 100 is down just under 4% from its recent peak and the DAX has lost under 2.5% so there is plenty of downside risk. Is that size correction likely? The lower mortality rate of the Wuhan virus is a reason for optimism it won’t. But extra caution is needed because China is now much more important to the global economy than it was in 2003.</p> 
   <p><strong>We think it is better to wait for the rise in the number of cases to slow before getting positive about the markets again.</strong> We know there is an incubation period of 14 days and the virus can be passed on when the subject is not showing symptoms. Putting that together, we could be on the cusp of a plateau or a massive escalation in the number of cases.</p>

  <p>My colleague Martin Farrer explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns.</p> 
   <p>Citigroup said on Tuesday: “The wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.”</p> 
   <p>The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth</p> 
   <p>“The outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,” said Capital’s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. “But it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China’s GDP this quarter.”</p> 
   <p>And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation.</p>

  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> 
  <p>Investors around the globe are focused on one question today -- how serious is the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and what impact will it have on the global economy?</p> 
  <p>Global equities suffered sharp losses on Monday, with Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged over 2% - its worst day since October. Wall Street followed, losing 1.5% as traders fretted that the virus could become a SARS-like epidemic proportions.</p> 
  <p>Overnight, the death toll from the virus hit 106, with more than 4,515 cases of the illness now been recorded across China. The first death has been reported in Beijing, highlighting how the virus has spread beyond the city of Wuhan.</p> 
  <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates"">Coronavirus: China death toll rises to 106 with first fatality in Beijing – live updates</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>This has prompted losses in some Asia-Pacific market today, particularly in markets which were closed on Monday. South Korea’s <strong>KOSPI 200</strong> index has been badly buffeted, losing 3% during Tuesday’s session, while Australia’s<strong> S&amp;P/ASX 200</strong> shed 1.35% , with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s economy is tightly linked to China, providing the coal and iron ore needed to sustain the Chinese economy. But it’s hard to assess quite how much economic damage coronavirus could cause.</p>

   <p>“We haven’t got enough information,” the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said.</p> 
   <p>McKibbin has previously estimated that a “mild” pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia’s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector.</p> 
   <p>And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%.</p>

  <p><strong>China’s stock markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year - preventing traders in Shanghai, Shenzhen or Beijing from selling stocks.</strong></p> 
  <p>Europe’s stock markets may recover today - the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> just opened 38 points higher (having lost 173 on Monday). But any signs that the virus is spreading faster or claiming more lives could send stocks down again.</p> 
  <p>Part of the problem, bluntly, is that pneumonia pandemics aren’t well understood in the City. Investors have been swotting up fast about incubation times, mortality rates and infectious control -- but it’s still hard to plug this public health crisis into a classic trading mode.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>Neil Wilson </strong>of<strong> Markets.com</strong> puts it:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p> The problem is investors have very limited visibility of the current situation in China, have virtually zero knowledge of epidemiology and virology, and have no clue how bad it will get or lasting the impact will be.</p> 
   <p>Risk models are not geared for this situation.</p>

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Finally, the FTSE 100 index has closed 68 points higher at 7480, up almost 1% today. That still means it has lost 100 points over the last two sessions, amid coronavirus worries. David Madden of CMC Markets says traders have been snapping up potential bargains after Monday’s rout, and hoping Beijing gets a grip on the crisis: Stock markets in Europe have pulled back some of the ground that was lost yesterday. In relation to the coronavirus, the situation has deteriorated in the past 24 hours as the number of confirmed infections has risen, and so has the number of fatalities. The positive move in equities is probably down to short covering plus bargain hunting as the health crisis has deepened. The longer the news story hangs around, traders might build up a tolerance to it. The Chinese central bank has made it clear it is willing to use monetary tools in a bid to lift economic sentiment, should they feel it is required. The message from Beijing reassured traders somewhat, but the acid test will be whether the rebound lasts or not. Here’s an interesting thread on the implications of the coronavirus, from Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Stock markets are now moving higher, lifted by hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be controlled following Zhong Nanshan’s optimistic comments today. The pick-up in American consumer confidence is also lifting equities, as it bodes well for US economic growth this year. But... the main indices have still only recovered a third of Monday’s losses. FTSE 100: up 61 points or 0.9% at 7,475 German DAX: up 87 points or 0.66% at 13,292 French CAC: up 48 points or 0.8% at 5,911 Wall Street has also opened higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 129 points or 0.45% (it lost 450 points on Monday). Chris Towner, Director at risk advisor JCRA, says investors are trying to get to grips with the Wuhan virus. “With the death toll rising above 100, financial markets are still trying to gauge the potential reach of this deadly virus. By comparison, the SARS virus impacted 8098 people with 774 fatalities. The question now is how quickly can this virus be contained and, in the meantime, how many countries and economies will be impacted? In times of risk aversion money normally floods into the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Due to the proximity of Japan to China the risk of the virus penetrating Japan is high, with one confirmed case so far. Therefore, the Swiss franc is currently seen as the ultimate safe haven and has strengthened by over 3% against the Euro from its pre-Christmas level of 1.10 CHF to the Euro in the 1.06’s, the strongest level since April 2017. Markets will now be focusing on the pace of the spread of the virus and whether there are signs of acceleration or deceleration.” Just in: US consumer confidence has rallied this month, by more than expected. The Confidence Board’s survey of consumer morale has spiked to 131.6, up from 128.2 last month. Americans interviewed for the survey said their current financial situation had improved, adding that they were more optimistic about their future prospects. A top Chinese respiratory scientist has predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus has predicted that the outbreak could peak in one week or around 10 days. Zhong Nanshan made the comments in an interview with Xinhua, the state news media site. They say: “It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases,” Zhong said. Zhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Zhong really knows his stuff -- he was deeply involved in fighting the SARS outbreak back in 2003 (telling reporters that the situation wasn’t under control). So this could be an encouraging signal, if Zhong is right.... But with more cases detected in Thailand today, and a second patient in Germany, the situation is still moving fast. Despite the slump in demand for aircraft, overall US durable goods rose by 2.4% in December. But if you strip out defence kit, demand was slightly lower. That’s a disappointing sign, says Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers: Ouch. We have fresh evidence today that Boeing’s 737 Max crisis is causing economic harm. First up, US aircraft orders plunged by almost 75% in December, according to the latest durable goods orders report just released. That’s the biggest slump in non-defence aircraft orders since 2009, as airline hold off buying 7373 Max jets until the problems that caused two fatal crashes are fixed. This delay is hurting Boeing (which sacked its CEO last month), and also harming its customers. It currently hopes to get the plane flying by this July. Ryanair has warned pilots that it could be forced to close some bases, resulting in job cuts, because of the persistent delays. In a memo, the budget airline told staff it won’t receive its first 737 Max jets until September or October at the earliest, as Ryanair does not take deliveries during its peak summer months of June, July and August. It had originally hoped to take delivery last April, boosting capacity on its routes. Back in the UK, some of the investors caught up in Neil Woodford savings scandal have learned how much of their money has been lost. And, as feared, it’s a very heavy blow. Link Fund Solutions, which has been winding up the Equity Income fund, says investors will receive an initial payment of 46.3p and 58.9p for each share they owned in the fund, compared to 100p when it was launched. They should receive a second payment, once the less-liquid assets held by the fund are sold off (although that will be a trickier task). More here: Several companies have instructed some staff not to come into the office Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have visited mainland China to work from home for the next fortnight, Reuters reports. Chinese video games giant Tencent and online retail giant Alibaba are also trying to keep staff out of the office, CNBC flags up: The oil price would probably be even lower, but for ongoing supply disruption in Libya. Libya’s crude output has tumbled in recent days, as the Libyan National Army (based in Benghazi) have blockaded ports as part of their campaign against the Libya’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord. This has pulled Libya’s oil production down from 1.2m barrels a day to 260,000 barrels and it could soon all-but run out. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, predicts that Opec (the oil cartel) could soon step in and cut supplies, to prop prices up. “The University of Hong Kong estimates that at least 25,630 people in Wuhan have symptoms of the virus with 44,000 infected with no symptoms yet. This should imply that the sell-off in Brent crude is still not yet over, as the crisis is still intensifying.... On the supply side however, we see that Libya’s oil production will likely be down to zero (from 1.1 m bl/day) within days. OPEC is also following the coronavirus situation closely. It will most likely step in and reduce supply for a month or two in order to prevent an inventory build-up which the market would have to struggle with for an extended period. The oil price is also suffering today, with Brent crude down 1% at $58.88 per barrel. At one stage it touched $58.88, the joint-lowest since October. Analysts at SP Angel Oil and Gas blame the ‘panic’ around the escalating coronavirus, telling clients: The number of casualties in China continues to climb, as do cases of the virus elsewhere in the world The Chinese government has tried to quarantine Wuhan and other cities, affecting tens of millions of people. Multinational businesses in China are also implementing lockdown procedures. Oil demand growth is the biggest factor weighing on prices, China’s oil demand has been growing at an annual rate of 5.5%, while comparatively, US oil demand has been growing by 0.5% Most of the demand loss will come from jet fuel as the risk of disease discourages travellers Back in the UK, retail sales remain flat this month despite the so-called Boris Bounce. Retailers are evenly split between those enjoying stronger sales this month, and those suffering weaker demand. That’s according to the CBI’s monthly ‘distributive trades’ survey, which has come in at zero for January, the same as December. That’s better than November’s -3, and a sharp improvement on the -49 suffered last August (when most shops reported declining volumes). Retailers also reported that sales were poor for the time of year, undermining the theory that December’s general election has brought much cheer. Anna Leach, CBI Deputy Chief Economist, says: “Both official data and business surveys are painting a picture of subdued activity for retailers. A challenging Christmas has extended into the New Year, with little expectation of any improvement soon. “2020 looks set to be another tough year for the sector as growth in households’ disposable income is set to remain modest and retailers continue to battle longer-term issues such as digital disruption and the cumulative burden of policy costs. The upcoming Budget provides an opportunity for the Chancellor to support retailers, primarily by fixing the broken business rates system.” Copper prices are also being hurt by the prospect of China’s economy slowing as its government grapples with the coronavirus shutdown. The futures price of Copper is down 0.5% today, and is on track for its 10th daily fall in a row. Copper is seen as a bellweather of the health of the global economy (known as ‘Doctor Copper’ in the City). Fashion chain Burberry is suffering badly from the virus crisis. It’s the biggest faller on the Footsie this morning, down 3.5% at £19.30. Burberry’s shares have now lost 17% of their value since 17th January, just before experts warned that the virus could be much more serious than first thought. Asia is a massively important market for Burberry. Last week, it reported that sales in mainland China had grown by “mid-teen” levels. It has been hoping for a bumper Lunar New Year -- creating a “Ratberry” campaign to piggy-back off the Year Of The Rat. It also planned to take its Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show to Shanghai in April and open our first social retail store in Shenzhen, in partnership with Tencent. Those plans could all be hurt by the Wuhan coronavirus. Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, has also been looking at previous viruses such as SARS, for indications of how the Wuhan coronavirus may play out. The lesson, he says, is that markets may tumble in the face of an epidemic-- but they then typically bounce back. “Of course, making any accurate quantitative estimate of what the coronavirus means for global and Chinese GDP growth estimates or what it might mean for financial markets is fraught with difficulties. However, that is the nature of the beast. Equity markets seem to want to believe “good news”. In other words, investors, in the absence of anything else to work on, refer to previous viruses, such as SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, as a template for price action in the markets or in terms of economic developments. The investment message from those episodes is that equity markets can drop 10% or so over a 1-3 month period before strongly bouncing back. Negative effects on economic growth are equally short-lived. For example, developing Asia recovered at an 11% pace after the summer of 2003.” The Coronavirus crisis could drive China’s economy into reverse, fears Freya Beamish. chief Asia Economist at Pantheon Economics. In a new research note, Beamish predicts that China’s “true” real GDP could be flat, or even fall in January-March, due to the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, factory shutdowns, and fearful consumers. She points out that the SARS virus caused a serious slowdown back in 2003, damaging service sector activity and manufacturing output. We reckon the brunt of the damage was done in Q2 2003, when real GDP growth dropped to 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, from an average of 2.8% in the previous three quarters. Growth then rebounded sharply in Q3, to 3.4%, coming off the favourable base of Q2, but again was weak in Q3. Although coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, it may be more contagious -- and Beijing may impose more stringent measures to tackle the virus. Beamish predicts: The bottom line here is that China could even see a contraction in quarterly real GDP growth in Q1, in reality, depending on the timing of factory closures and how long it takes to contain the virus. We are assuming that missed spending will be recouped in Q2, leading to a bumper quarter, though it’s very possible that some of the expenditure on services around the holiday simply will be lost. This means the overall economy may not bounce back in the same way as in 2003. In short, you can make up for factory shutdowns by increasing overtime, but making up spending for a lost holiday is more complicated. And the containment measures could go on for longer than in our baseline assumption. A person in Japan who has not visited Wuhan has contracted the coronavirus, local media are reporting. Reuters explains: Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said a person in Japan who had not visited Wuhan has contracted the new coronavirus, Japanese media reported on Tuesday. The infected person is a tour bus driver in his 60s in the city of Nara, Kyodo said. Health Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. The European market rally is now fading, as Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam outlines new measures to curb transport between her city and mainland China. Hong Kong is suspending its high-speed rail link with China, and also cutting the number of flights in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Sensible measures, but they also highlight how the epidemic will hurt economic activity in the region. After their worst day in four months yesterday, European stock markets have opened higher this morning. But it’s only a small recovery, given they lost over 2% on Monday. FTSE 100: up 27 points or 0.38% at 7439 German DAX: up 38 points or 0.3% at 13,239 French CAC: up 27 points or 0.5% at 5,891 Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders should await coronavirus developments.... It makes sense to compare and draw some inference between now and the performance of markets during SARS. European equities saw a 20-25% drawdown during SARS. The FTSE 100 is down just under 4% from its recent peak and the DAX has lost under 2.5% so there is plenty of downside risk. Is that size correction likely? The lower mortality rate of the Wuhan virus is a reason for optimism it won’t. But extra caution is needed because China is now much more important to the global economy than it was in 2003. We think it is better to wait for the rise in the number of cases to slow before getting positive about the markets again. We know there is an incubation period of 14 days and the virus can be passed on when the subject is not showing symptoms. Putting that together, we could be on the cusp of a plateau or a massive escalation in the number of cases. MSCI’s index of emerging markets shares has dropped by 0.5% today, amid worries that the coronavirus will hurt global growth. John Velis of BNY Mellon Markets says: With Chinese authorities working hard to contain the spread of the virus, and firms and provinces extending the week-long lunar new year to prevent massive travel volumes at the height of an epidemic, we’re seeing anecdotal evidence of large factories going idle until well after the new year, and foreign companies evacuating non-Chinese citizens. Japan’s stock market has fallen to a three-week low today. The Nikkei shed 0.55%, hurt by coronavirus worries and a rally in the yen (as investors race for save havens). Companies exposed to the Chinese economy did badly, but shares in pharmaceuticals firms jumped. Reuters has the details: Shares of South Korean mask producer Monalisa surged 29%, while South Korean pharmaceuticals Kukje Pharma and Woojung Bio added 29% and 21% respectively on Tuesday. Japan’s Kawamoto Corp, which supplies medical products including masks, saw its share prices tripled, while Japanese protective clothing maker Azearth rose 53% in the past week. Malaysia’s Top Glove Corp has seen its shares surge by a quarter in a week. Several economists fear that the coronavirus will hurt China’s economy -- although there’s uncertainty over quite how bad it will be. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: Economists agreed that the outbreak will have a negative impact in China but the lack of understanding about how the virus spreads and how bad it might be was adding to uncertainty to the mix and compounding investor concerns. Citigroup said on Tuesday: “The wildcard is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is. The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained.” The consultancy Capital Economics said the impact could be similar to the Sars outbreak in 2003 which knocked three percentage points off growth “The outbreak is developing too rapidly to predict with any confidence the final extent of the economic damage,” said Capital’s chief Asia economist Mark Williams. “But it is now certain that the outbreak will have a significant impact on China’s GDP this quarter.” And although China recovered quickly from Sars, Williams said the local economy was much stronger back in 2003 and was not facing the cyclical and structural headwinds posed by slowing population growth and industrialisation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe are focused on one question today -- how serious is the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, and what impact will it have on the global economy? Global equities suffered sharp losses on Monday, with Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged over 2% - its worst day since October. Wall Street followed, losing 1.5% as traders fretted that the virus could become a SARS-like epidemic proportions. Overnight, the death toll from the virus hit 106, with more than 4,515 cases of the illness now been recorded across China. The first death has been reported in Beijing, highlighting how the virus has spread beyond the city of Wuhan. This has prompted losses in some Asia-Pacific market today, particularly in markets which were closed on Monday. South Korea’s KOSPI 200 index has been badly buffeted, losing 3% during Tuesday’s session, while Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.35% , with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards. Australia’s economy is tightly linked to China, providing the coal and iron ore needed to sustain the Chinese economy. But it’s hard to assess quite how much economic damage coronavirus could cause. My colleague Ben Butler reports: “We haven’t got enough information,” the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said. McKibbin has previously estimated that a “mild” pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia’s gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector. And in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%. China’s stock markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year - preventing traders in Shanghai, Shenzhen or Beijing from selling stocks. Europe’s stock markets may recover today - the FTSE 100 just opened 38 points higher (having lost 173 on Monday). But any signs that the virus is spreading faster or claiming more lives could send stocks down again. Part of the problem, bluntly, is that pneumonia pandemics aren’t well understood in the City. Investors have been swotting up fast about incubation times, mortality rates and infectious control -- but it’s still hard to plug this public health crisis into a classic trading mode. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com puts it: The problem is investors have very limited visibility of the current situation in China, have virtually zero knowledge of epidemiology and virology, and have no clue how bad it will get or lasting the impact will be. Risk models are not geared for this situation. Here’s a pithier take: Also coming up today A new healthcheck on Britain’s retail sector is expected to show a pick-up in spending this month, as confidence rises following December’s general election. New economic surveys from the US could show a rise in durable goods orders, and consumer confidence. However, such data could soon be overtaken by concerns over the coronavirus.

England’s fragility at the back underpinned even the most positive of results.</p> \n<p>Now Neville’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/phil-neville-to-step-down-as-england-womens-manager-next-summer-before-euro-2022-olympics"">impending exit</a>, with the delay in its announcement likely a technicality rather than any kind of turnaround, is proving his appointment was not worth the risk. The issues the governing body was willing to overlook to find a clean-cut, mouldable, Gareth Southgate mark two have come home to roost and now they face another messy departure.</p> \n<p>The mess is not entirely of the governing body’s making, though. A clean break is difficult in this unprecedented time of crisis. How could the FA possibly pay off Neville while it is furloughing some staff and cutting the pay of others? It would be a PR disaster. That means it is, to some extent, stuck with Neville until the end of his contract in July 2021.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3e08db4ae13a2cac57782ad6fdb9be238b2331d0""> \n <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3e08db4ae13a2cac57782ad6fdb9be238b2331d0/0_0_3291_2193/1000.jpg"" alt=""The England players react to their World Cup semi-final defeat to USA last summer."" width=""1000"" height=""666"" class=""gu-image""> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=""element-image__caption"">The England players react to their World Cup semi-final defeat to USA last summer.</span> \n  <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Maddie Meyer/FIFA via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The unspoken problem is what happens with the position of Team GB coach for the postponed Olympics. How could the FA afford to extend his contract to cover the Olympics when the ideal successor may want that to be part of the deal? In not doing so, the FA confirms his status as a lame duck and is reliant on a successor being available for the Olympics and ready to handle a tight turnaround.</p> \n<p>There may also be issues around the existence of Team GB itself. Home nations had committed to come together for this summer’s Games and, while unlikely they will pull out, it should not be considered a given they will all wish to push ahead with a joint team next July, particular with budgets hit by the coronavirus crisis and the new calendar of back-to-back international tournaments promising to test player welfare.</p> \n<p>Allowing Neville to lead Team GB, should it exist as initially agreed, at the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/30/tokyo-olympics-to-start-in-july-2021-after-coronavirus-rescheduling"">rescheduled Tokyo Olympics</a> would mean a contract extension as his current one is due to expire during the tournament. However, the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/13/fa-baroness-sue-campbell-womens-football"">FA’s head of women’s football, Sue Campbell</a>, has always stressed a need for managerial continuity through major tournaments, hence having Neville signed up to cover both the Olympics and European Championship pre-pandemic. Swapping Neville out for someone new in time for Euro 2021, which will now take place in 2022, will likely not have been seen as an option.</p> \n<p>With Campbell having, as recently as March at the SheBelieves Cup, expressed an extreme fondness for and belief in Neville, it is plausible they offered him a new contract, despite the mounting pressure, to take him past the long-targeted World Cup in 2023. Less likely is that Neville would have been willing to commit his future to the Lionesses for an additional two years beyond next summer.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""b4d4f7f6-414a-4a21-a63c-dd233169c735"" data-atom-type=""audio""> \n  <div>\n   <div class=""atom-Audio""></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The leaking of Neville’s exit more than a year from now is the FA’s biggest problem. It suggests that someone is unhappy with the deal that has been reached.

Allowing Neville to lead Team GB, should it exist as initially agreed, at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics would mean a contract extension as his current one is due to expire during the tournament. However, the FA’s head of women’s football, Sue Campbell, has always stressed a need for managerial continuity through major tournaments, hence having Neville signed up to cover both the Olympics and European Championship pre-pandemic. Swapping Neville out for someone new in time for Euro 2021, which will now take place in 2022, will likely not have been seen as an option. With Campbell having, as recently as March at the SheBelieves Cup, expressed an extreme fondness for and belief in Neville, it is plausible they offered him a new contract, despite the mounting pressure, to take him past the long-targeted World Cup in 2023. Less likely is that Neville would have been willing to commit his future to the Lionesses for an additional two years beyond next summer.

It’s little more than a couple of weeks since he came out of intensive care and his partner has just given birth to a baby boy. But sounding breathless before he had even gasped out his opening sentence at his first Downing Street press conference since falling ill with the coronavirus probably wasn’t the commanding, reassuring presence he had hoped to convey. The Boss may be back, but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words, but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life, there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror, he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment.

A grateful nation, watching the way doctors and nurses have put their lives on the line, feels inspired to give something back. The 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore marching around his garden has captured our imagination, and people across the UK have put their hands in their pockets and donated more than £28m to his campaign. All told, between Captain Tom and others, more than £80m has been raised so far, and will be distributed via the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 appeal. NHS charities have a venerable history. Until 1948, when they were folded into the new health service, charities provided much of the UK’s healthcare. Nowadays, every NHS trust has a charity attached, and many survive from that time. Perhaps the most famous is the children’s charity associated with Great Ormond Street hospital, which dates back to 1852. Nowadays, NHS charities provide everything from capital funding for experimental technology to counselling and respite care for the hard-pressed health workers who are currently giving so much. But the NHS itself is not a charity. It shouldn’t have to be relying on charitable money to provide essential services to the British people. Unfortunately there’s a bad history of exactly that happening. Too often, in recent years as governments have cut back provision, donated money has had to go on providing essential services that are the role of the state. Charities – not just in the NHS, but in education, social care and many other domains – are using their resources to fill in around a system that can no longer quite cope. A 2018 poll of charity finance teams, for example, found that it was common for government bodies to ask charities to carry out services such as care and advice on their behalf, and that more than half of all charities subsidised those public services with donated money. This isn’t right. There needs to be a clear division between what charities are for, and what the state is for. Charities are a vital force in the UK. In 2016-17 they spent more than £48bn to help bring communities together, provide vital emergency aid, and lobby and campaign for a better world. They’ve helped those who are struggling in ways that the monolithic institutions of the state are often simply not able to do. But charities are not there to replace universal state intervention. They are there to do what the state cannot. The argument over charitable funds is laid clear when it comes to personal protective equipment (PPE), which the NHS has been desperately short of during this pandemic. There’s been some discussion of the fact that under charity law, money raised for the NHS can’t be spent on PPE. And this makes sense: PPE is an essential, lifesaving tool. It shouldn’t be funded out of the chance generosity of ordinary people clubbing together. It should come out of a properly planned, properly resourced core budget. And for this to happen, that budget must be paid for, and that means taxes. Take the Duke of Westminster, who has received praise for a £12.5m donation to NHS charities recently. He didn’t have to do it and his contribution should be applauded. But it’s also worth remembering that his £10bn fortune is due in part to the fact that he has benefitted from the UK’s tax laws, which can be relatively generous to those like himself who inherit very significant wealth. Under a more progressive tax structure, his contribution would rise by many multiples of his recent giving. We all use the NHS.

</figure>","<p>It is the fate of Lazio supporters, according to the Italian voice actor Pino Insegno, to “suffer even in those moments when we were not supposed to”. The Biancocelesti were enjoying one of their finest seasons prior to the coronavirus outbreak, sitting one point off the top of Serie A at the moment when games were suspended. They are undefeated in the league since September, and beat the leaders, Juventus, twice in December.</p> 
<p>Football, as Insegno was quick to remind listeners to the Roman station Radiosei last week, is of secondary importance at a time when Italy is on lockdown. “We need to stay home, and that’s it,” he continued. “We have not lived through a moment like this since the war.” Still, it is a curious quirk of fate that Lazio – champions of Italy just twice in their history – were denied a shot at a title on the only previous occasion when football was suspended mid-season on the peninsula.</p>

<p>It was war that thwarted them in 1915. No single top division existed back then, but rather a series of regional tournaments. The season was supposed to culminate in a grand final between the champions of the north and the best of the rest. Those plans were shelved after Italy entered the first world war in May, prompting the national football federation (FIGC) to suspend play.</p> 
<p>Lazio had already progressed through a regional sub-section and then won a mini-league between the top four teams from central Italy. All that separated them from the grand final was a knock-out tie against the champions of the south. But that match never took place. </p> 
<p>Instead, the Scudetto lay vacant for four years before, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, the FIGC issued a resolution awarding it to Genoa in 1919. The Rossoblu had been <a href=""https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Genoa/21-02-2020/scudetto-ipotecato-genoa-99-anni-lazio-reclama-3601130199715.shtml"">top of the northern section</a> at the time when the leagues were suspended, with one game still to play.</p>

<p>A nation in post-war recovery barely noticed. Another two years would pass before Gazzetta – acting as an official mouthpiece for the federation – arranged a small dinner ceremony to present Genoa with their title. Almost a century later, that act is still under dispute. </p> 
<p>This February, a lawyer named Gian Luca Mignogna presented fresh documents to the FIGC, asserting that their own regulations from the era should have prohibited the title from being awarded in such a manner. He has argued for it to be shared between Genoa and Lazio instead. A petition supporting him <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/spettabile-federazione-italiana-gioco-calcio-lazio-1914-15-campione-d-italia-ex-aequo"">on change.org</a> has drawn more than 35,000 signatures.</p> 
<p>In truth, Lazio were not the only ones with a right to feel aggrieved. Genoa’s remaining game in the northern section would have been against Torino, who lay within overtaking distance and had beaten them 6-1 in their previous head-to-head. Inter, in third, were not mathematically out of the running either.</p> 
<p>The picture was less clear in the southern section, with a deciding game between Naples and Internazionale Napoli reportedly annulled due to an irregularity with player registrations. In theory, Lazio still needed to overcome the winner of that tie to qualify for the grand final.</p>

<p>Northern teams were manifestly dominant in this period. Lazio had reached the previous two finals only to get thumped on both occasions: losing 6-0 to Pro Vercelli at a neutral venue in 1913, then 9-1 to Casale over two legs a year later. After the war, teams representing the north went on to win every Scudetto until the formation of a single national top division in 1926.</p> 
<p>Such outcomes were no accident. In an era before professionalism, teams from wealthier cities were often able to recruit more effectively with the help of friendly local businesses that lured players with the promise of comfortable employment. Some had more direct means. Two Genoa players were banned for life in 1913 after being caught trying to pay in substantial cheques signed by their club’s president, though those suspensions were eventually overturned.</p> 
<p>Much has changed over the course of a century, yet the fact that the FIGC are still dealing with the fallout from 1915 might be a salutary lesson for football’s governing bodies as they consider how to proceed today. The federation’s president, Gabriele Gravina, last week outlined four options for Serie A to proceed once quarantine restrictions are lifted.</p> 
<p>The first, preferred solution, would see all the games being completed on a delayed schedule (perhaps even, as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/italy-considers-splitting-2019-20-serie-a-campaign-over-two-seasons"">he suggested on Monday</a>, by splitting the games across two seasons). If that is not possible, then the league will either need to declare this season vacant, set the current standings as final or hold some form of play-off for the top positions and relegation.</p> 
<p>None of those options would be universally popular, and tensions between clubs with competing interests are rising. Lazio’s president, Claudio Lotito, is reported to have argued with his Juventus counterpart, Andrea Agnelli, during a conference call on Friday over the prospect of players returning to training before the country’s lockdown is lifted.</p>

<p>In the midst of a pandemic with a rising death toll, the hope must be that all parties can find a common ground that places public health as the greatest priority. But it is clear that for some people, at least, the scars of 1915 are yet to heal.</p> 
<p>“The fear is that the current season will come to the same end as the one interrupted by the Great War, and, just like back then, the interruption will become an occasion to deny Lazio the recognition of a Scudetto won on the pitch,” wrote Lazio’s head of communications, Arturo Diaconale, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/arturo.diaconale/photos/a.292228430951889/1472447532929967/?type=3&amp;theater"">in a long Facebook post</a> on 9 March, shortly before Serie A was suspended.</p> 
<p>“This syndrome of the denied title from 1915 is spreading almost as much as the epidemic from China. Because it releases that old fear that, in a situation of maximum uncertainty provoked by a health emergency paralysing our country, the interests of the big clubs can be turned to the damage of the Biancocelesti.”</p> 
<p>His crass (and, bluntly, incorrect) framing drew condemnation even from many of his own followers.

The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler’s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer.

Cox chose The Stone Monkey, a Chinese fairytale told by the Victorian author and Chinese language and culture scholar Herbert Allen Giles in what Cox described as “a beautiful little pamphlet” of tales published in 1911. “I hope you enjoy it,” he added.</p> <p>Before becoming <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/06/geoffrey-cox-who-is-new-figure-heart-of-brexit-talks"">attorney general under Theresa May</a>, Cox was arguably best known for having the highest outside earnings in parliament, because he continued to work as a QC while serving as an MP in Devon.</p> <p>Now the politician, whose booming oration was described as sounding like “<a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/attorney-general-geoffrey-cox-voice_uk_5c0562b5e4b066b5cfa46a55?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEL6vSr_A3YeOZe6-bxwgTysrjkO1_vveuqAUm0xIJBfOyKcSS9gBagEMkCJDJ2P5Uf5QufytcXLTwbOnRB_V_ke92Jp8F2bCdylptp1f0sZu-dPvjlBg1_aUI0j-G9RETJb32tniTAfJDeQAGWNAL2i-EVKM070iy1XY6jjBizP"">Uncle Monty played by Brian Blessed</a>”, has joined the ranks of well-known bedtime storytellers.

The show has more than 120,000 followers and the videos have been viewed more than 27m times, with an estimated 18,000 donations so far. “I don’t have any children, but I’ve been watching the videos,” Betsy Zorio, the head of Save the Children’s US programmes and advocacy, told the Hollywood Reporter. “They’ve become a nice little way to take a break during the day and get your mind off the shortage of toilet paper.” On Thursday, Dolly Parton will start her own weekly online storytelling programme by reading The Little Engine That Could. The country star and Glastonbury favourite said the Goodnight With Dolly series on YouTube should act as “a welcome distraction during a time of unrest and also inspire a love of reading and books”. Parton’s charity Imagination Library, which she started in 1996, has delivered more than 130m free books to children, making her known simply as “the book lady” to a generation who might have never heard her songs such as Jolene. Unorthodox choices to get children off to sleep are nothing new. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the BBC recruited the likes of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, the Batman and Venom star Tom Hardy and the Captain America actor Chris Evans as narrators for its CBeebies Bedtime Story. With coronavirus perhaps leaving stars with as little to do as much of the rest of the population, a swathe of other names are now doing the same. Other celebrities recruited for the Save the Children campaign include Jimmy Fallon and Gal Gadot, who has already had one Covid-19 viral moment when she appeared in a much maligned celebrity-packed cover version of John Lennon’s Imagine. The bedtime story trend has reached beyond the usual celebrity circles, with the former attorney general and Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox adding his name to the list of night-time narrators. “I’ve been asked to record a children’s bedtime story for while we are cooped up in CV confinement,” he wrote in a tweet introducing his story. Cox chose The Stone Monkey, a Chinese fairytale told by the Victorian author and Chinese language and culture scholar Herbert Allen Giles in what Cox described as “a beautiful little pamphlet” of tales published in 1911. “I hope you enjoy it,” he added. Before becoming attorney general under Theresa May, Cox was arguably best known for having the highest outside earnings in parliament, because he continued to work as a QC while serving as an MP in Devon. Now the politician, whose booming oration was described as sounding like “Uncle Monty played by Brian Blessed”, has joined the ranks of well-known bedtime storytellers. There were suggestions Cox should start narrating audiobooks after a clip of him reading A Visit from St Nicholas, more commonly known as ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas, was widely circulated in December last year.', 'charCount': '3990', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/lanre-bakare"">Lanre Bakare</a> Arts and culture

Discreet locations would be preferable rather than clearly visible, because neighbours might find it distressing.” A rising death toll is also likely to place a strain on burial and cremation services, which normally handle about 600,000 deaths a year. “Crematoria will gear up as much as they can and look at longer working days, working weekends and evenings, shift working and reducing the time for funeral services,” said Julie Dunk, the chief executive of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management. “It will depend on staff being well and available.” In response to questions about temporary morgues, a government spokesperson said it was “undertaking sensible contingency planning for every eventuality – including the reasonable worst-case scenario”. “This does not mean we expect it to happen,” the spokesperson said. “Public safety is our top priority. We have a team of public health experts and scientists working around the clock to make sure the NHS and UK more widely is fully prepared.” When the UK government was pursuing a herd immunity strategy, the UK was on course for 250,000 deaths. The new approach, involving isolation of the elderly and widespread social distancing, is an attempt to reduce that to the thousands or tens of thousands. In 2014, a report by the Human Tissue Authority said there were 16,000 fridge and freezer spaces for bodies in mortuaries that it licensed in the UK for postmortems. There are further spaces in funeral director premises. A spokesperson for Portakabin said: “I can confirm we are working closely with government and the NHS during the outbreak of coronavirus. We have provided a variety of buildings and continue to offer solutions when and where they are needed most. Portakabin regularly works with government and the NHS and we’re proud to be able to support our nation’s healthcare system at this incredibly challenging time.”', 'charCount': '4228', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/robertbooth"">Robert Booth</a> Social affairs correspondent'}","[{'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'type': 'campaign', 'webTitle': 'callout-coronavirus', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'references': [], 'campaignInformationType': 'callout'}, {'id': 'society/death-and-dying', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Death and dying', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/death-and-dying', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/death-and-dying', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'science/infectiousdiseases', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'science', 'sectionName': 'Science', 'webTitle': 'Infectious diseases', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/society', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Society', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/robertbooth', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Robert Booth', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertbooth', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertbooth', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Robert Booth is social affairs correspondent of the Guardian.

Indian police found them places in a backpackers’ lodge. Linford, a cafe owner, said he had seen Russian, German, Bulgarian and Italian citizens all repatriated by their governments in the last 48 hours but the UK embassy had been “no help whatsoever”. “In this hostel, every other country has left,” he said. “We’re totally stuck: we can’t leave Delhi, we can’t stay in Delhi.

<p>Boris Johnson told the Commons on Wednesday that a “massive, massive” repatriation effort was under way to rescue the estimated 1 million Britons currently overseas. He signalled that diplomatic flights were being arranged where commercial carriers could not operate.</p> 
<p>The developments come as the first rescue plane arrived in Peru as part of the mission to repatriate more than 600 British and Irish travellers. Peru is one of several countries to tighten its travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the government closing all airports and insisting only government-organised flights, flying out of military airbases, will be permitted to leave the country.</p>

But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families’ jobs and living standards.</p> <p>One thing is clear: even once we’re through this crisis, we can’t go back to business as usual.</p> <p>Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn’t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up.</p> <p>We’ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently – people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby.</p> <p>We’ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It’s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most – carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers – still get paid the least.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797/14_26_5112_3067/1000..jpg"" alt=""A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room – as well as business. The solutions we found together aren’t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership.</p> <p>After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency – and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too.</p> <p>That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren’t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose.</p> <p>We can’t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 – immediately before coronavirus hit.</p> <p>While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won’t be easy.</p> <p>But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life – not just in a crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Smith, manager of </strong><strong>the £17bn Fundsmith Equity</strong></h2> <p><em>‘No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom’</em></p> <p>What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind:</p> <p>1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom</p> <p>2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis</p> <p>3. Buy so-called “value” stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall</p> <p>4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events</p> <p>The first strategy suffers from one major drawback – no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest.</p> <p>Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down.</p> <p>Buying so-called “value” stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%.</p> <p>I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called “value” investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It’s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven’t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses.</p> <h2><strong>Phil Spencer, TV property expert</strong></h2> <p><em>‘The market is likely to take a fair while to recover’</em></p> <p>It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped.</p> <p>Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can’t raise a mortgage … or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn’t matter what market you’re dealing in – whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn – for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It’s as simple as that.</p> <p>The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain?</p> <p>Working on that assumption – it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? </p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98/335_326_2964_1779/1000..jpg"" alt=""The UK housing market is shut."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The UK housing market is shut.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average.</p> <p>So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I’m absolutely sure it will get there – a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help – but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there’s a wealth of free information on my advice site <a href=""https://www.moveiq.co.uk/"" title="""">moveiq.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Peter Hargreaves, </strong><strong>founder of Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></h2> <p><em>‘Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically’</em></p> <p>Right now I’m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I’ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There’s still an awful lot of people not on the internet.</p> <p>It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold £550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around £17.50 a share compared with around £13 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I’ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December – it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight.</p> <p>When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won’t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for.</p> <p>I’ve put £20m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been.</p> <p>Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I’m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to.</p> <h2><strong>Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food</strong></h2> <p><em>‘Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online’</em></p> <p>It’s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven’t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue.</p> <p>Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. </p> <p>Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. </p> <p>Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an “only when necessary shopping” mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal.</p> <p>The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. </p> <h2><strong>Caroline Lucas, Green party MP</strong></h2> <p><em>‘Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income’</em></p> <p>Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it’s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people’s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were “unskilled” are now essential workers – and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty.</p> <p>We’re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops. I don’t necessarily think the panic-buying and early response to coronavirus will see them replace supermarkets. But I think people are appreciating how fragile our food supply system is and how dependent it is on invisible armies of poorly paid people. </p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3bbf1fffef9221d2f3717ee54b255d4de9db980b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3bbf1fffef9221d2f3717ee54b255d4de9db980b/408_778_4163_2497/1000..jpg"" alt=""Deck chairs on Brighton beach"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Caroline Lucas says there are some responses to the pandemic that ‘if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people’s lives’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Neil Fraser/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I know there are no guarantees. We’ve seen too many false dawns, ignored too many warnings in the past. And there are some responses to this pandemic which, if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people’s lives.</p> <p>There are things being said now, though, which cannot be unsaid. Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that “we’ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else”; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens.</p> <h2><strong>Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths</strong></h2> <p><em>‘A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not’</em></p> <p>Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Consumers are going to be more aware and conscious than ever before. Food retailers will need to understand how they make customers feel, while front-line workers will have more responsibility for running “their business”.</p> <p>In my personal purpose there is a line that reads, “There is no such thing as a dull person”. At Booths I describe empowerment as “legitimising common sense”. After three weeks of facing into Covid-19, this simple sentiment has accelerated our responses. Remote working and the use of modern video technologies has enabled our business to run at a high pace despite there only being a team of some 12 people physically attending our central office.</p> <p>It has not been a smooth ride for those having to maintain a physical presence either in distribution centres, manufacturing areas and the stores. Distancing and safety routines have made many tasks more difficult, and the attitude with which colleagues have carried out their daily tasks has been heart-warming.</p> <p>The future of food retailing will be fast-paced. Overarching everything will be the need for customers to feel loved. Family and friends are going to mean more to all of us, and communities will be rebuilt with a keener awareness of local values. Globalism will not die but should become a way of understanding diversity as opposed to a means by which to direct wealth to the few. A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not.</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '44', 'wordcount': '2400', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-04-04T09:00:01Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-04-04T09:00:01Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-04-04T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dhqz9', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee15bff73bce5b42f7fece1920ae09a8cfb9a58/0_0_5000_3000/500..jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'Will the coronavirus change the way we spend, shop and invest our money, long after the virus is history?

Frances O’Grady, general secretary, TUC ‘We can’t go back to business as usual’ Right now the priority has to be fighting Covid-19. But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families’ jobs and living standards. One thing is clear: even once we’re through this crisis, we can’t go back to business as usual. Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn’t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up. We’ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently – people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby. We’ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It’s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most – carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers – still get paid the least. During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room – as well as business. The solutions we found together aren’t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership. After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency – and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too. That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren’t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose. We can’t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 – immediately before coronavirus hit. While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won’t be easy. But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life – not just in a crisis. Terry Smith, manager of the £17bn Fundsmith Equity ‘No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom’ What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind: 1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom 2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis 3. Buy so-called “value” stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall 4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events The first strategy suffers from one major drawback – no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest. Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down. Buying so-called “value” stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%. I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called “value” investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It’s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times. Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven’t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses. Phil Spencer, TV property expert ‘The market is likely to take a fair while to recover’ It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped. Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can’t raise a mortgage … or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn’t matter what market you’re dealing in – whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn – for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It’s as simple as that. The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain? Working on that assumption – it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average. So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I’m absolutely sure it will get there – a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help – but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there’s a wealth of free information on my advice site moveiq.co.uk Peter Hargreaves, founder of Hargreaves Lansdown ‘Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically’ Right now I’m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I’ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There’s still an awful lot of people not on the internet. It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold £550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around £17.50 a share compared with around £13 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I’ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December – it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight. When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won’t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for. I’ve put £20m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been. Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I’m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to. Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food ‘Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online’ It’s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven’t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue. Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an “only when necessary shopping” mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal. The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. Caroline Lucas, Green party MP ‘Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income’ Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it’s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people’s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were “unskilled” are now essential workers – and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty. We’re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops. I don’t necessarily think the panic-buying and early response to coronavirus will see them replace supermarkets. But I think people are appreciating how fragile our food supply system is and how dependent it is on invisible armies of poorly paid people. But I know there are no guarantees. We’ve seen too many false dawns, ignored too many warnings in the past. And there are some responses to this pandemic which, if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people’s lives. There are things being said now, though, which cannot be unsaid. Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that “we’ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else”; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens. Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths ‘A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not’ Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom. Consumers are going to be more aware and conscious than ever before. Food retailers will need to understand how they make customers feel, while front-line workers will have more responsibility for running “their business”. In my personal purpose there is a line that reads, “There is no such thing as a dull person”. At Booths I describe empowerment as “legitimising common sense”. After three weeks of facing into Covid-19, this simple sentiment has accelerated our responses. Remote working and the use of modern video technologies has enabled our business to run at a high pace despite there only being a team of some 12 people physically attending our central office. It has not been a smooth ride for those having to maintain a physical presence either in distribution centres, manufacturing areas and the stores. Distancing and safety routines have made many tasks more difficult, and the attitude with which colleagues have carried out their daily tasks has been heart-warming. The future of food retailing will be fast-paced. Overarching everything will be the need for customers to feel loved. Family and friends are going to mean more to all of us, and communities will be rebuilt with a keener awareness of local values. Globalism will not die but should become a way of understanding diversity as opposed to a means by which to direct wealth to the few. A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not.', 'charCount': '13794', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'true', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/patrickcollinson"">Patrick Collinson</a>'}","[{'id': 'money/money', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Money', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/money', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/money', 'references': []}, {'id': 'money/consumer-affairs', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Consumer affairs', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/money/consumer-affairs', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/money/consumer-affairs', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/business', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Business', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/business', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/business', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/features', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/patrickcollinson', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Patrick Collinson', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickcollinson', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/patrickcollinson', 'references': [], 'bio': ""<p>Patrick Collinson is money editor of the Guardian and the newspaper's personal finance editor</p>"", 'bylineImageUrl': 'https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/23/1400851508217/Patrick-Collinson.jpg', 'bylineLargeImageUrl': 'https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Patrick-Collinson,-R.png', 'firstName': 'Patrick ', 'lastName': 'Collinson'}, {'id': 'publication/theguardian', 'type': 'publication', 'sectionId': 'theguardian', 'sectionName': 'From the Guardian', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian', 'references': [], 'description': ""All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice.""}, {'id': 'theguardian/mainsection', 'type': 'newspaper-book', 'sectionId': 'news', 'sectionName': 'News', 'webTitle': 'Main section', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection', 'references': []}, {'id': 'theguardian/mainsection/money', 'type': 'newspaper-book-section', 'sectionId': 'money', 'sectionName': 'Money', 'webTitle': 'Money', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/money', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/money', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-money', 'type': 'tracking', 'webTitle': 'UK Money', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-money', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-money', 'references': []}]",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,After coronavirus: 'We can't go back to business as usual',"<p>Guardian Money asks experts in finance, the workplace, property and food to give their predictions</p>","Guardian Money asks experts in finance, the workplace, property and food to give their predictions",Patrick Collinson,"<figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""3ee15bff73bce5b42f7fece1920ae09a8cfb9a58""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee15bff73bce5b42f7fece1920ae09a8cfb9a58/0_0_5000_3000/1000..jpg"" alt=""Monfuture"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Looking ahead to after coronavirus: (clockwise from top left) Jo Whitfield, Phil Spencer, Caroline Lucas, Peter Hargreaves, Terry Smith and Frances O’Grady. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Composite: PA/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>","<p>Will the coronavirus change the way we spend, shop and invest our money, long after the virus is history?

Will we abandon city centre offices, with many more permanently working from home? Or will we return to all our past practices once this grim episode is over? Guardian Money asked experts in finance, the workplace, property, food and the environment to set out what they think will emerge in the medium term. Frances O’Grady, general secretary, TUC ‘We can’t go back to business as usual’ Right now the priority has to be fighting Covid-19. But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families’ jobs and living standards. One thing is clear: even once we’re through this crisis, we can’t go back to business as usual. Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn’t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up. We’ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently – people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby. We’ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It’s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most – carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers – still get paid the least. During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room – as well as business. The solutions we found together aren’t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership. After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency – and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too. That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren’t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose. We can’t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 – immediately before coronavirus hit. While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won’t be easy. But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life – not just in a crisis. Terry Smith, manager of the £17bn Fundsmith Equity ‘No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom’ What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind: 1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom 2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis 3. Buy so-called “value” stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall 4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events The first strategy suffers from one major drawback – no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest. Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down. Buying so-called “value” stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%. I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called “value” investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It’s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times. Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven’t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses. Phil Spencer, TV property expert ‘The market is likely to take a fair while to recover’ It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped. Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can’t raise a mortgage … or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn’t matter what market you’re dealing in – whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn – for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It’s as simple as that. The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain? Working on that assumption – it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average. So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I’m absolutely sure it will get there – a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help – but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there’s a wealth of free information on my advice site moveiq.co.uk Peter Hargreaves, founder of Hargreaves Lansdown ‘Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically’ Right now I’m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I’ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There’s still an awful lot of people not on the internet. It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold £550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around £17.50 a share compared with around £13 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I’ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December – it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight. When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won’t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for. I’ve put £20m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been. Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I’m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to. Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food ‘Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online’ It’s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven’t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue. Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an “only when necessary shopping” mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal. The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. Caroline Lucas, Green party MP ‘Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income’ Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it’s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people’s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were “unskilled” are now essential workers – and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty. We’re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops. I don’t necessarily think the panic-buying and early response to coronavirus will see them replace supermarkets. But I think people are appreciating how fragile our food supply system is and how dependent it is on invisible armies of poorly paid people. But I know there are no guarantees. We’ve seen too many false dawns, ignored too many warnings in the past. And there are some responses to this pandemic which, if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people’s lives. There are things being said now, though, which cannot be unsaid. Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that “we’ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else”; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens. Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths ‘A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not’ Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom. Consumers are going to be more aware and conscious than ever before. Food retailers will need to understand how they make customers feel, while front-line workers will have more responsibility for running “their business”. In my personal purpose there is a line that reads, “There is no such thing as a dull person”. At Booths I describe empowerment as “legitimising common sense”.

Distancing and safety routines have made many tasks more difficult, and the attitude with which colleagues have carried out their daily tasks has been heart-warming. The future of food retailing will be fast-paced. Overarching everything will be the need for customers to feel loved. Family and friends are going to mean more to all of us, and communities will be rebuilt with a keener awareness of local values.

It’s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend’s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I’m anxious, too.</p> <p>It’s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don’t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other’s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin’s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it’s like being reunited with an old friend.</p> <p>Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was “forever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share”, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec’s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. </p> <p>Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I’m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I’m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I only learned of Dec’s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn’t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad’s “other son” during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother.</p> <p>Not wanting to disrupt Rory’s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec’s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility.</p> <p>Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin’s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I.</p> <p>Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. “I still get called ‘the bastard Busby’ down the pub,” he says. “And at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.” This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father’s name, and those of his half-siblings.</p> <p>Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn’t really connect until later in life. “If we’d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,” Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. “But now you’re my little brother.” We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would.</p> <p>How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been <a href=""https://www.standalone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/StandAlonePrevalenceRESEARCH3.pdf"" title="""">touched by estrangement</a>, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have <a href=""https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/core/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CSJ-Press-Release-Lone-Parents.pdf"" title="""">no significant contact with their father</a>. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: “It can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they’re not in contact with,” she says. “If their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.”</p> <p>However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: “You’re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.”</p> <p>Reunions aren’t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/28/three-identical-strangers-the-bizarre-tale-of-triplets-separated-at-birth"" title="""">Three Identical Strangers</a>, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have.</p> <p>My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been?</p> <h2>‘You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling. But when one turns up, it’s great’: Sandy Busek, 53, and Paul Busek, 51</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6eca6d36e641fab08da3d525d353c5eb32c2ea53""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/6eca6d36e641fab08da3d525d353c5eb32c2ea53/0_2372_6003_5403/1000.jpg"" alt=""Sandy and Paul Busek"" width=""1000"" height=""900"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘He’s a nicer guy, but I’m better-looking,’ jokes Paul Busek (right) of Sandy.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. “I wasn’t close with my mum,” Sandy says. “She was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.”</p> <p>When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy’s visit – during which he was told to stay upstairs – had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn’t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family’s past.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn’t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. “We met up in Ireland and got on well,” Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul’s daughter, not realising she was his niece. “She printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,” Sandy says.</p> <p>“My wife was gobsmacked,” Paul recalls. “I wouldn’t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.” In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn’t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along “like a house on fire”, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. “You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it’s like, ‘OK, yeah, this is great’,” Paul says.</p> <p>They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense; on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. “We look so similar,” Paul says. “Incredibly similar bad taste, too.”</p> <p>“It’s spooky how many similarities there are,” Sandy agrees. “But there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he’s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.”</p> <p>Paul says: “I think he’s probably a nicer guy than me. He’s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn’t. He’s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.” Then he jokes: “I think he gets insanely jealous that I’m better-looking.”</p> <p>Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. “I don’t sit here thinking life could’ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.” This will become easier now that Paul’s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. “We didn’t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, ‘Bloody hell, we like it here’,” Paul says. “Whenever I’m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids – and my brother.”</p> <h2>‘I knew there was something different.

He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. “But I was always told to shut up.”</p> <p>Then, one night, an aunt “spilled the beans”. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.”</p> <p>Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We’re brothers and sisters. It feels like we’ve known each other since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.”</p> <p>Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’”</p> <p>Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’”</p> <p>Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. </p> <p>Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.”</p> <p>“We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.”</p> <h2>‘As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family.

Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.</p> <p>Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia.</p> <p>She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.”</p> <p>She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">Families</a> <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">And How</a> <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">To Survive Them</a>, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.”</p> <p>Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I’d always thought I could be walking down the street past my sister or my brother.

All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks.

It’s nice not to have to lie or make something up.”</p> <p>Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn’t belong. “It’s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,” Peggy says. “You dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked – I started to heal.”</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '13', 'wordcount': '3377', 'commentCloseDate': '2020-04-14T07:00:08Z', 'commentable': 'true', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-04-11T07:00:08Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-04-11T08:19:06Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-04-11T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dfz6j', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/c2b5569fb97af19c1e2d9cb7da3e2a6f55db3950/0_1813_6192_3715/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': '“I’d always wanted a brother,” says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It’s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend’s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I’m anxious, too. It’s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don’t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other’s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin’s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it’s like being reunited with an old friend. Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was “forever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share”, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec’s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I’m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I’m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age. I only learned of Dec’s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn’t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad’s “other son” during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother. Not wanting to disrupt Rory’s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec’s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility. Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin’s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I. Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. “I still get called ‘the bastard Busby’ down the pub,” he says. “And at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.” This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father’s name, and those of his half-siblings. Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn’t really connect until later in life. “If we’d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,” Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. “But now you’re my little brother.” We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would. How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been touched by estrangement, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have no significant contact with their father. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: “It can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they’re not in contact with,” she says. “If their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.” However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: “You’re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.” Reunions aren’t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have. My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been? ‘You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling. But when one turns up, it’s great’: Sandy Busek, 53, and Paul Busek, 51 Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. “I wasn’t close with my mum,” Sandy says. “She was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.” When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy’s visit – during which he was told to stay upstairs – had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn’t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family’s past. Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. “We met up in Ireland and got on well,” Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul’s daughter, not realising she was his niece. “She printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,” Sandy says. “My wife was gobsmacked,” Paul recalls. “I wouldn’t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.” In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn’t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along “like a house on fire”, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. “You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it’s like, ‘OK, yeah, this is great’,” Paul says. They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense; on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. “We look so similar,” Paul says. “Incredibly similar bad taste, too.” “It’s spooky how many similarities there are,” Sandy agrees. “But there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he’s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.” Paul says: “I think he’s probably a nicer guy than me. He’s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn’t. He’s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.” Then he jokes: “I think he gets insanely jealous that I’m better-looking.” Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. “I don’t sit here thinking life could’ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.” This will become easier now that Paul’s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. “We didn’t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, ‘Bloody hell, we like it here’,” Paul says. “Whenever I’m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids – and my brother.” ‘I knew there was something different. But I was told to lift the carpet and sweep it under’: Dougie Lothian, 69, and Jo Fowler, 68 Dougie grew up in Edinburgh in the 1950s, and never felt a sense of belonging. He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. “But I was always told to shut up.” Then, one night, an aunt “spilled the beans”. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.” Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures. Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.” Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’” Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’” Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.” “We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.” ‘As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family. Everything clicked’: Peggy Mills, 60, and Linda Sturman, 62 Peggy’s identity crisis began the moment she was born, in Brixton, south London, in 1959. Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot. Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia. She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.” She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about Families And How To Survive Them, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.” Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.” The contact came after Linda’s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. “It was a shock,” Linda says. “I said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.” Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being “like two pieces of a jigsaw coming together”. Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark’s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents’ chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her. “I’d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,” Peggy says. “But this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have – no, ‘You did this to me when we were 12’.” Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks.

His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. “I wasn’t close with my mum,” Sandy says. “She was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.”</p> <p>When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy’s visit – during which he was told to stay upstairs – had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected.

I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.” In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn.

According to Paul, the half-brothers got along “like a house on fire”, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. “You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it’s like, ‘OK, yeah, this is great’,” Paul says.</p> <p>They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles.

He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. “But I was always told to shut up.”</p> <p>Then, one night, an aunt “spilled the beans”. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.”</p> <p>Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We’re brothers and sisters. It feels like we’ve known each other since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.”</p> <p>Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’”</p> <p>Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’”</p> <p>Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. </p> <p>Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.”</p> <p>“We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.”</p> <h2>‘As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family.

Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.</p> <p>Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia.</p> <p>She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.”</p> <p>She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">Families</a> <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">And How</a> <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html"" title="""">To Survive Them</a>, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.”</p> <p>Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I’d always thought I could be walking down the street past my sister or my brother. But this was for real and we fitted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The contact came after Linda’s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. “It was a shock,” Linda says. “I said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.” Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being “like two pieces of a jigsaw coming together”.</p> <p>Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark’s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents’ chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her.</p> <p>“I’d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,” Peggy says. “But this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have – no, ‘You did this to me when we were 12’.”</p> <p>Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.” Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. </p> <p>“We have a good bond,” Linda says. “I feel as if I’ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.” With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. “It has given me an identity and a sense of pride,” Peggy says. “Being mixed race, people ask you: ‘Where are you from?’, ‘What’s your heritage?’. It’s nice not to have to lie or make something up.”</p> <p>Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn’t belong. “It’s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,” Peggy says. “You dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked – I started to heal.”</p>",3377,true,2020-04-11T07:00:08Z,false,false,2020-04-11T08:19:06Z,UK,The Guardian,https://gu.com/p/dfz6j,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/c2b5569fb97af19c1e2d9cb7da3e2a6f55db3950/0_1813_6192_3715/500.jpg,false,en,true,"“I’d always wanted a brother,” says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It’s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend’s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I’m anxious, too. It’s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don’t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other’s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin’s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it’s like being reunited with an old friend. Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was “forever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share”, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec’s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I’m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I’m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age. I only learned of Dec’s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn’t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad’s “other son” during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother. Not wanting to disrupt Rory’s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec’s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility. Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin’s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I. Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. “I still get called ‘the bastard Busby’ down the pub,” he says. “And at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.” This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father’s name, and those of his half-siblings. Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn’t really connect until later in life. “If we’d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,” Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. “But now you’re my little brother.” We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would. How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been touched by estrangement, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have no significant contact with their father. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: “It can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they’re not in contact with,” she says. “If their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.” However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: “You’re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.” Reunions aren’t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have. My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been? ‘You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling.

He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.” Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures. Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.” Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’” Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’” Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.” “We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.” ‘As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family. Everything clicked’: Peggy Mills, 60, and Linda Sturman, 62 Peggy’s identity crisis began the moment she was born, in Brixton, south London, in 1959. Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot. Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia. She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.” She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about Families And How To Survive Them, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.” Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.” The contact came after Linda’s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. “It was a shock,” Linda says. “I said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.” Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being “like two pieces of a jigsaw coming together”. Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark’s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents’ chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her. “I’d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,” Peggy says. “But this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have – no, ‘You did this to me when we were 12’.” Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.” Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. “We have a good bond,” Linda says. “I feel as if I’ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.” With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. “It has given me an identity and a sense of pride,” Peggy says. “Being mixed race, people ask you: ‘Where are you from?’, ‘What’s your heritage?’. It’s nice not to have to lie or make something up.” Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn’t belong. “It’s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,” Peggy says. “You dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked – I started to heal.”",18943,false,false,"<a href=""profile/mattha-busby"">Mattha Busby</a>",2020-04-14T07:00:08Z,,13,2020-04-11T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-04-11,2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,0

Govia Thameslink Railway said it would make a second batch of cuts in a week’s time, and has already slashed trains to Gatwick airport. Network Rail has said retailers in its stations will not have to pay rent for the first quarter.

Greece followed the lead of Iran and Italy, where deaths on Thursday rose to 148, by shuttering educational institutions and cancelling sports events and other public gatherings in three western regions. The national public health organisation said the two-day shutdown included “a suspension of all mass gatherings” at theatres, cinemas, museums and sports events in the Peloponnese regions of Achaia and Ileia and the island of Zakynthos. As the number of infections jumped from 10 to 31 in a single day, a health ministry official said it expected a significant rise in cases in the coming weeks. All 21 of the new cases were detected among travellers who had recently returned from Israel and Egypt, and are believed to be connected with a 65-year-old man battling pneumonia in a hospital isolation unit in the western port city of Patras. At least nine people were said to be in serious condition. Announcing the measures, health authorities said efforts were moving into the second phase of a multi-pronged strategy to contain the outbreak, focussing on stopping the virus spreading from western Greece’s Amaliada region to other parts of the country. Ancient Olympia, where the flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on 12 March, is situated in Ileia. The Greek Olympic committee said it was drastically scaling back accreditations “to those absolutely necessary”, limiting festivities and cancelling all event dinners and galas. Greece’s precautionary measures came as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, said countries should be preparing for sustained community transmission and called for governments to play their part in stopping the spread of the coronavirus within their own borders. Tedros said: “Our message to all countries is: this is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country.” Iran said it would begin erecting checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and urged people to reduce their use of paper banknotes, as authorities scramble to contain the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country. The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March. Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus. Iran has also cancelled Friday prayers in major cities. The coronavirus outbreak has had a dramatic effect on Islamic worship elsewhere in the Middle East. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia – which has already banned citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca – took the unprecedented step of emptying out Islam’s holiest site so that it could be sterilised. State television broadcast images of an empty white-tiled area surrounding the Kaaba - a large black cube structure inside Mecca’s Grand Mosque – which is usually packed with tens of thousands of pilgrims. The move was a “temporary preventive measure” but the upper floors of the Grand Mosque were still open for prayers, a Saudi official told Agence France-Presse. Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, the virus has infected 95,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200. The Italian government on Wednesday ordered the closure of all schools and universities after the virus spread to all 20 regions, infecting 3,296 people – 590 more than Wednesday. It also confirmed that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors due to the outbreak, until 3 April. South Africa on Thursday became the latest country to confirm its first case of the coronavirus, which was linked to Italy: a 38-year-old man who had travelled to the country with his wife in a group of 10 people. South Korea’s infection toll neared 6,000 on Thursday, while there were a further 31 virus deaths in Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases – a rise on the previous day’s total. As more than 3,740 cases were confirmed across the Middle East, the Palestinian health ministry declared a state of medical emergency in the West Bank city of Bethlehem and closed all mosques and churches in the area, including the Nativity church in Bethlehem, built over the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born. Authorities in the Palestinian territories also cancelled all sports events in the city and shut schools. Four Palestinians are reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus but the cases have yet to be confirmed. On Thursday, the German airline group Lufthansa cancelled all flights to Israel until 28 March after Israeli authorities barred entry to almost all non-resident arrivals from five European nations, including Germany, over coronavirus fears. Israel also ordered citizens and Israeli residents from the same countries – France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland – into quarantine. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates warned its citizens and foreign residents not to travel, and sent the 215 foreigners it evacuated from Hubei in China to a quarantine centre set up in a humanitarian hub in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The UAE is home to Emirates, the government-owned airline based at Dubai international airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state’s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco.

<p>The Italian government on Wednesday ordered <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus"">the closure of all schools</a> and universities after the virus spread to all 20 regions, infecting 3,296 people – 590 more than Wednesday.</p> 
<p>It also confirmed that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors due to the outbreak, until 3 April.</p> 
<p>South Africa on Thursday became the latest country to confirm its first case of the coronavirus, which was linked to Italy: a 38-year-old man who had travelled to the country with his wife in a group of 10 people.</p> 
<p>South Korea’s infection toll neared 6,000 on Thursday, while there were a further 31 virus deaths in Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases – a rise on the previous day’s total.</p>

    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>
    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>
     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>
     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>
     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>
     <li>Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>
    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>

<p><em>Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report<br></em></p>",993,,2020-03-05T13:18:39Z,false,false,2020-03-18T10:57:18Z,UK,The Guardian,https://gu.com/p/dd5hv,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/baa9a195e26c7be04f96f650b905e875939c4392/0_331_6720_4032/500.jpg,false,en,true,"Greece has become the latest country to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus by closing schools and universities and cancelling large public gatherings, as the World Health Organization insisted the virus could still be “pushed back” if governments around the world took the necessary action. Greece followed the lead of Iran and Italy, where deaths on Thursday rose to 148, by shuttering educational institutions and cancelling sports events and other public gatherings in three western regions. The national public health organisation said the two-day shutdown included “a suspension of all mass gatherings” at theatres, cinemas, museums and sports events in the Peloponnese regions of Achaia and Ileia and the island of Zakynthos. As the number of infections jumped from 10 to 31 in a single day, a health ministry official said it expected a significant rise in cases in the coming weeks. All 21 of the new cases were detected among travellers who had recently returned from Israel and Egypt, and are believed to be connected with a 65-year-old man battling pneumonia in a hospital isolation unit in the western port city of Patras. At least nine people were said to be in serious condition. Announcing the measures, health authorities said efforts were moving into the second phase of a multi-pronged strategy to contain the outbreak, focussing on stopping the virus spreading from western Greece’s Amaliada region to other parts of the country. Ancient Olympia, where the flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on 12 March, is situated in Ileia. The Greek Olympic committee said it was drastically scaling back accreditations “to those absolutely necessary”, limiting festivities and cancelling all event dinners and galas. Greece’s precautionary measures came as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, said countries should be preparing for sustained community transmission and called for governments to play their part in stopping the spread of the coronavirus within their own borders. Tedros said: “Our message to all countries is: this is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country.” Iran said it would begin erecting checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and urged people to reduce their use of paper banknotes, as authorities scramble to contain the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country. The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March. Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus. Iran has also cancelled Friday prayers in major cities. The coronavirus outbreak has had a dramatic effect on Islamic worship elsewhere in the Middle East. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia – which has already banned citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca – took the unprecedented step of emptying out Islam’s holiest site so that it could be sterilised. State television broadcast images of an empty white-tiled area surrounding the Kaaba - a large black cube structure inside Mecca’s Grand Mosque – which is usually packed with tens of thousands of pilgrims. The move was a “temporary preventive measure” but the upper floors of the Grand Mosque were still open for prayers, a Saudi official told Agence France-Presse. Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, the virus has infected 95,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200. The Italian government on Wednesday ordered the closure of all schools and universities after the virus spread to all 20 regions, infecting 3,296 people – 590 more than Wednesday. It also confirmed that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors due to the outbreak, until 3 April. South Africa on Thursday became the latest country to confirm its first case of the coronavirus, which was linked to Italy: a 38-year-old man who had travelled to the country with his wife in a group of 10 people. South Korea’s infection toll neared 6,000 on Thursday, while there were a further 31 virus deaths in Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases – a rise on the previous day’s total.

I did CBT, which I found positive and helpful.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have a son who is now two years old, and </strong><strong>worry he has started to display OCD tendencies, and that I am passing it on. Though I am far better than I was, I struggle with managing some behaviours, including handwashing. </strong><strong>With the threat of Covid-19, this has ramped up,</strong><strong> and I have been </strong><strong>fastidious about the whole household washing hands. I try to do it in a “normal” way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: “I need wash my hands again – I dirty” and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again.</strong></p> <p><strong>We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a </strong><strong>new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don’t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates hand</strong><strong>washing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues?</strong></p> <p>It’s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (<a href=""http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk"" title="""">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads <strong>–</strong> but in a diluted form <strong>–</strong> when I’m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what’s happening to you. In your treatment, I’m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts.</p> <p>“First,” Music said, “let’s think about your boy. There’s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that’s normal. He’s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.”</p> <p>Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing <strong>–</strong> and nothing more. Of course you don’t want it to turn into something else, but in these heightened times, and with your history, you may be picking up on something you recognise, and giving it more meaning than it deserves.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/24/i-slept-with-my-best-friends-ex-now-im-terrified-of-confrontation"">I slept with my best friend\'s ex. Now I\'m terrified of confrontation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing that may help, Music advised, is “if you could find ways of relaxing a little, looking after your anxious self”. What might those be at the moment? Maybe talking about it to your husband, who you say in your original letter is very supportive; or checking in with a trusted friend? If you can find ways to dissipate your angst, that will go some way to helping you to deal with your son in a more relaxed way; it will also help you eventually see your son’s behaviour as the separate entity it is. (Is your husband worried?) Remember also that when we worry about things, it’s very hard to step back, have an air of confidence and joke about them, all of which would be useful tools right now.</p> <p>Practically speaking, could you allow yourselves to wash your hands when you come in, and have certain protocols around toilet training and washing hands before eating, etc, but try to relax about touching things that are already in the house? Forgetting, if we can, about coronavirus for a moment, a sterile environment is not optimal for our immune system.</p> <p>If your son, for example, balks at using a towel he perceives to be dirty, you could gently model that “Mummy can use it”, and if he asks to wash his hands when he doesn’t need to, you can say, “No, you don’t need to now.” Remember the way you say things is probably more important than what you say; and also remember that he may need time to take this message on board.</p> <p>If you can, you might also want to consider both of you going outside into the garden, if you have one, and getting (safely) dirty. Slowly he will learn the difference between when to wash his hands and when to be more relaxed about it.</p> <p>• Send your problem to <a href=""mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com"" title="""">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

I try to do it in a “normal” way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: “I need wash my hands again – I dirty” and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again. We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don’t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates handwashing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues? It’s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (childpsychotherapy.org.uk) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads – but in a diluted form – when I’m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what’s happening to you. In your treatment, I’m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts. “First,” Music said, “let’s think about your boy. There’s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that’s normal. He’s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.” Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing – and nothing more. Of course you don’t want it to turn into something else, but in these heightened times, and with your history, you may be picking up on something you recognise, and giving it more meaning than it deserves. One thing that may help, Music advised, is “if you could find ways of relaxing a little, looking after your anxious self”. What might those be at the moment? Maybe talking about it to your husband, who you say in your original letter is very supportive; or checking in with a trusted friend? If you can find ways to dissipate your angst, that will go some way to helping you to deal with your son in a more relaxed way; it will also help you eventually see your son’s behaviour as the separate entity it is. (Is your husband worried?) Remember also that when we worry about things, it’s very hard to step back, have an air of confidence and joke about them, all of which would be useful tools right now. Practically speaking, could you allow yourselves to wash your hands when you come in, and have certain protocols around toilet training and washing hands before eating, etc, but try to relax about touching things that are already in the house? Forgetting, if we can, about coronavirus for a moment, a sterile environment is not optimal for our immune system. If your son, for example, balks at using a towel he perceives to be dirty, you could gently model that “Mummy can use it”, and if he asks to wash his hands when he doesn’t need to, you can say, “No, you don’t need to now.” Remember the way you say things is probably more important than what you say; and also remember that he may need time to take this message on board. If you can, you might also want to consider both of you going outside into the garden, if you have one, and getting (safely) dirty. Slowly he will learn the difference between when to wash his hands and when to be more relaxed about it. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

A flipside of sainthood is martyrism. I work with many healthcare staff who buy into the signals that they should always be self-sacrificing, saying yes when they really want to say no and be willing to “go the extra mile”. Faced with impossible demands, both internally and externally, they cannot hold to healthy boundaries for themselves and for others; the end results are the extremes of stress, exhaustion and burnout, and monumentally high levels of sickness, absenteeism and attrition. While being clapped every Thursday is an acknowledgement of their emotional and physical labours beyond the call of duty, and a temporary morale-booster, it would be far better to honour them by recognising their ordinary humanity with practical, long-term measures. First, give them all a pay rise that acknowledges the losses they have all endured after 10 years of austerity, and then some. Second, make it a legal requirement for the NHS to use evidence-based tools, which are nowadays available, to ensure workloads are always matched by staffing levels. Third, now that the dependency on immigrant carers is plain for all to see, bypass the still hostile values and byzantine rules of the Home Office and reward all those foreign workers who have given so much with British citizenship.

On Tuesday, concerns over supply chain shortages led the Indian government to place limits on the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines and vitamins made from them. The restricted drugs include paracetamol, antibiotics such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone, which is used in the contraceptive pill, and and vitamins B12, B1 and B6. The drugs account for 10% of all India’s pharmaceutical exports. India is one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of drugs, with the US and Europe heavily reliant on the supply. India’s pharmaceutical companies source about 70% of their ingredients from Chinese factories, many of which have been shut for weeks owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The closure of airports in China has also impeded supplies reaching India. While many Indian factories had stockpiled ingredients due to the lunar new year, those supplies are running low and most factories are covered only until the end of March. Sahil Munjal, the vice-chair of the pharmaceutical export promotion council of India, said the restrictions could have a lasting impact on the global availability of commonly used drugs. “In India we have maximum dependency on China, so if things do not improve in March and China’s factories do not reopen then it is going to be a big, big disruption in global logistics and in the market,” Munjal said. He said the impending shortages were already pushing up prices. “If coronavirus goes on much longer, there will definitely be an impact on Indian plants and then 100% there will be a shortage of these medicines across the world. And right now it is very difficult to know what is happening in China, so we don’t know when the factories might open again.” Indian pharmaceutical companies said they were still unclear what the restrictions entailed. More than 50% of India’s drugs are made for export, and many drugs produced in India cannot be sold on the domestic market. Jatish Sheth, the director of Srushti Pharmaceuticals, said: “These are everyday products and the idea with the restrictions is to prevent a shortage in the country. But this will have a global impact.” Sheth said pharmaceutical companies in India were worried about the situation. “If things in China start moving now, there might not be a very acute shortage,” he said. “But if they do not then it is going to be a serious problem.” While some of the ingredients are also produced in factories outside China, the strict regulation of drug production means Indian factories cannot simply source them elsewhere.

He played keyboards, sometimes several at once: nothing compared to the banks of equipment behind which Rick Wakeman plied his trade, but far more than most punk bands would countenance. Sometimes his playing recalled the reedy organ sounds found on 60s garage rock singles by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F_and_the_Mysterians"">? and the Mysterians</a> or the Standells, which was just about acceptable under punk rules. More often, he played exactly like someone who’d been in a prog rock band, decorating songs with complex arpeggios, which absolutely wasn’t. Moreover, his playing was the Stranglers’ signature sound: with the greatest of respect to Hugh Cornwell’s gruff vocals, or Jean-Jacques Burnel’s fluid bass playing, when you think of the Stranglers’ most famous songs – from Peaches and No More Heroes to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ynd2A91cXA"">Waltzinblack</a> and Golden Brown – you think first of Greenfield’s keyboards.</p> <p>His contributions were the solitary aspect of the Stranglers’ music you might describe as beautiful. Everything else about them was as relentlessly, wilfully nasty as their song titles suggested: Ugly, Tits, Bring on the Nubiles, Nice N’ Sleazy, Peasant in the Big Shitty, Down in the Sewer and – oh God – I Feel Like a Wog. If it makes for profoundly uncomfortable listening now – “problematic” barely begins to cover the lyrical content – their music had a remarkable power, a sense of unceasing, misanthropic hostility. But they sounded less like a punk band than a band that predated punk, that sprang out of that weird, liminal period immediately prior to 1976, where the bleakness of mid-70s Britain had seeped into rock’s fringes – the tougher end of the pub-rock scene, the more thuggish bits of late-period glam – but not yet become codified into series of musical diktats.

If it makes for profoundly uncomfortable listening now – “problematic” barely begins to cover the lyrical content – their music had a remarkable power, a sense of unceasing, misanthropic hostility.

During the 2018 World Cup, YouTube’s subscription service in the US suffered an outage during England’s semi-final against Croatia. “People are coming to YouTube to find authoritative news, learning content and make connections during these uncertain times,” YouTube said. “While we have seen only a few usage peaks, we have measures in place to automatically adjust our system to use less network capacity. We are in ongoing conversations with the regulators (including Ofcom), governments and network operators all over Europe, and are making a commitment to temporarily default all traffic in the UK and the EU to standard definition. We will continue our work to minimise stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience.” Amazon is second only to Netflix in global subscriptions, with an estimated 118m Prime Video users. There are about 35m users across Europe, with 9m of those in the UK, according to Ampere Analysis. BritBox, the fledgling streaming joint venture between ITV and the BBC, said that it will not at this stage follow suit. “We have not reduced or restricted our highest-quality streams on BritBox, which are full high-definition, but will keep the situation under review including any official guidance or feedback from partners and suppliers,” a spokeswoman for the service said. Ofcom, the UK broadcasting and media regulator, is in discussions with TV, telecoms and broadband companies about what measures may need to be taken to avoid broadband congestion. “We’re working with major broadband firms and service providers to understand their ongoing plans for keeping networks resilient,” a spokesman said. “We’re also engaging with the government, which is leading on planning

It has fallen eerily silent. Denmark is under coronavirus lockdown, and the Danes have imposed strict border controls. On the Swedish side, the Øresund remains open, although, understandably not many are making that journey.</p> \n<p>It feels surreal in Sweden just now. Working from my local cafe, I terror-scroll through Twitter seeing clips of deserted cities, or army trucks transporting the dead in Italy, surrounded by the usual groups of chatty teenagers, mothers with babies and the occasional freelancer.</p> \n<p>Outdoors, couples stroll arm in arm in the spring sunshine; Malmö’s cafe terraces do a brisk trade. On the beach and surrounding parkland at Sibbarp there were picnics and barbecues this weekend; the adjoining skate park and playground were rammed. No one was wearing a mask.</p> \n<p>The global pandemic has closed down Europe’s economies and confined millions of people across the continent to their homes. But here, schools, gyms, and (fully stocked) shops remain open, as do the borders. Bars and restaurants continue to serve, and trains and buses are still shuttling people all over the country. You can even, if you wish, go to the cinema (it smainly indie fare: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/18/the-peanut-butter-falcon-review-trailer-shia-labeouf-dakota-johnson"">The Peanut Butter Falcon</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/11/mr-jones-review-agnieszka-holland-james-norton-berlin-film-festival"">Mr</a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/11/mr-jones-review-agnieszka-holland-james-norton-berlin-film-festival""> Jones</a> were on at my local arthouse over the weekend).</p> \n<p>The precautions that Swedes have been advised to adopt – no gatherings of more than 50 people (revised down from 500 last Friday), avoid social contact if over 70 or ill, try to work from home, table service only in bars and restaurants – seem to have allayed public fears that the shocking images from hospitals in Italy and Spain could be repeated here.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Stefan Löfven, has urged Swedes to behave “as adults” and not to spread “panic or rumours”. </p> \n<p>Panic, though, is exactly what many within Sweden’s scientific and medical community are starting to feel. A petition signed by more than 2,000 doctors, scientists, and professors last week – including the chairman of the Nobel Foundation, <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/about/board-of-directors/"">Prof</a><a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/about/board-of-directors/""> </a><a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/about/board-of-directors/"">Carl-Henrik Heldin</a> – called on the government to introduce more stringent containment measures. “We’re not testing enough, we’re not tracking, we’re not isolating enough – we have let the virus loose,” said Prof Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, a virus immunology researcher at the <a href=""https://ki.se/en"">Karolinska Institute</a>. “They are leading us to catastrophe.”<br></p> \n<p>Strong words, but stoicism is a way of life here, as is unflappability. A 300-year history of efficient and transparent public administration, and high levels of trust in experts and governing officials, have left the public inclined to believe what they are told, and that those doing the telling have their best interests at heart.</p> \n<p>“I trust that the doctors working with the government know what they are doing, so I suppose we’re as well prepared as we can be,” Robert Andersson, 50, a vendor manager in IT who lives in Södermalm, Stockholm, said. “This ‘hysteria’ that the media is launching is far more dangerous than the virus itself.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""6c57b5ccabebfec7d53f976de54240dc252ab478""> \n <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/6c57b5ccabebfec7d53f976de54240dc252ab478/0_0_4767_3178/1000.jpg"" alt=""People walk among the cherry blossoms at Kungsträdgården in Stockholm"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image""> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=""element-image__caption"">People walk among the cherry blossoms at Kungsträdgården in Stockholm.

Just don’t call it “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19"">herd immunity</a>”, a phrase that Tegnell, and the authorities, have steadfastly refused to use.</p> \n<p>It says much for the transparency and accountability that Swedes expect from public figures that Tegnell remains so accessible to the media. With criticism of Sweden’s response to Covid-19 mounting, he has the slightly exasperated tone of a man tired of repeating the obvious when asked what he thinks of the growing concern and calls for a city-wide quarantine of Stockholm, given the very recent spike in cases there. On Monday, Sweden said it had recorded <a href=""https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa"">3,700 cases</a> and 110 deaths.</p> \n<p>“Yes, there has been an increase but it’s not traumatic so far. Of course, we’re going into a phase in the epidemic where we’ll see a lot more cases in the next few weeks, more people in the ICU, but that’s just like any other country – nowhere has been able to slow down the spread considerably.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""241cb373-579d-4c0c-b51e-3538d7dc1b18"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vLoUrmKv8zE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sweden’s nearest EU neighbours – the Danes, Finns, and Norwegians – have accepted a lockdown strategy, closing schools, workplaces, and borders weeks ago. “The problem with that approach is you tire the system out,” Tegnell said. “You can’t keep a lockdown going for months – it’s impossible.”</p> \n<p>But such a situation may become inevitable. “The government thinks they can’t stop it, so they’ve decided to let people die,” Söderberg-Nauclér said. “They don’t want to listen to the scientific data that’s presented to them. They trust the Public Health Agency [<em><a href=""https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/"">Folkhälsomyndigheten</a></em>] blindly, but the data they have is weak – embarrassing even.</p> \n<p>“We are seeing signs of a higher doubling rate than Italy, Stockholm will soon have an acute ICU shortage, and they don’t understand that by then it will be too late to act<em>. </em>All of this is very dangerous.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea"" data-atom-type=""interactive""> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tegnell gives such criticism short shrift: “There is no evidence whatsoever that doing more at this stage would make any difference. It’s far better to introduce stringent measures at very specific intervals, and keep them running for as little time as possible.”</p> \n<p>While there is a constant reappraisal of the situation, Tegnell says Sweden has the crisis under control. “We believe we have the most important measures in place already. Of course, we might have to do more things, but we’re not there yet.”</p> \n<figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Callout callout-coronavirus""> \n <iframe class=""fenced"" srcdoc=""<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>""></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, Swedes seem to believe him, going about their daily routines wondering if – not when – that point might be reached.

It has fallen eerily silent. Denmark is under coronavirus lockdown, and the Danes have imposed strict border controls. On the Swedish side, the Øresund remains open, although, understandably not many are making that journey. It feels surreal in Sweden just now. Working from my local cafe, I terror-scroll through Twitter seeing clips of deserted cities, or army trucks transporting the dead in Italy, surrounded by the usual groups of chatty teenagers, mothers with babies and the occasional freelancer. Outdoors, couples stroll arm in arm in the spring sunshine; Malmö’s cafe terraces do a brisk trade. On the beach and surrounding parkland at Sibbarp there were picnics and barbecues this weekend; the adjoining skate park and playground were rammed. No one was wearing a mask. The global pandemic has closed down Europe’s economies and confined millions of people across the continent to their homes. But here, schools, gyms, and (fully stocked) shops remain open, as do the borders. Bars and restaurants continue to serve, and trains and buses are still shuttling people all over the country. You can even, if you wish, go to the cinema (it smainly indie fare: The Peanut Butter Falcon and Mr Jones were on at my local arthouse over the weekend). The precautions that Swedes have been advised to adopt – no gatherings of more than 50 people (revised down from 500 last Friday), avoid social contact if over 70 or ill, try to work from home, table service only in bars and restaurants – seem to have allayed public fears that the shocking images from hospitals in Italy and Spain could be repeated here. The prime minister, Stefan Löfven, has urged Swedes to behave “as adults” and not to spread “panic or rumours”. Panic, though, is exactly what many within Sweden’s scientific and medical community are starting to feel. A petition signed by more than 2,000 doctors, scientists, and professors last week – including the chairman of the Nobel Foundation, Prof Carl-Henrik Heldin – called on the government to introduce more stringent containment measures. “We’re not testing enough, we’re not tracking, we’re not isolating enough – we have let the virus loose,” said Prof Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, a virus immunology researcher at the Karolinska Institute. “They are leading us to catastrophe.” Strong words, but stoicism is a way of life here, as is unflappability. A 300-year history of efficient and transparent public administration, and high levels of trust in experts and governing officials, have left the public inclined to believe what they are told, and that those doing the telling have their best interests at heart. “I trust that the doctors working with the government know what they are doing, so I suppose we’re as well prepared as we can be,” Robert Andersson, 50, a vendor manager in IT who lives in Södermalm, Stockholm, said. “This ‘hysteria’ that the media is launching is far more dangerous than the virus itself.” Simon Strand, 30, a business consultant in Östermalm, Stockholm, agrees. “There is no reason to believe the authorities are not paying attention,” he said. Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, who is leading the government’s handling of the crisis, advocates a strategy of mitigation: allow the virus to spread slowly without overwhelming the health system, and without recourse to draconian restrictions. Just don’t call it “herd immunity”, a phrase that Tegnell, and the authorities, have steadfastly refused to use. It says much for the transparency and accountability that Swedes expect from public figures that Tegnell remains so accessible to the media. With criticism of Sweden’s response to Covid-19 mounting, he has the slightly exasperated tone of a man tired of repeating the obvious when asked what he thinks of the growing concern and calls for a city-wide quarantine of Stockholm, given the very recent spike in cases there. On Monday, Sweden said it had recorded 3,700 cases and 110 deaths. “Yes, there has been an increase but it’s not traumatic so far. Of course, we’re going into a phase in the epidemic where we’ll see a lot more cases in the next few weeks, more people in the ICU, but that’s just like any other country – nowhere has been able to slow down the spread considerably.” Sweden’s nearest EU neighbours – the Danes, Finns, and Norwegians – have accepted a lockdown strategy, closing schools, workplaces, and borders weeks ago. “The problem with that approach is you tire the system out,” Tegnell said. “You can’t keep a lockdown going for months – it’s impossible.” But such a situation may become inevitable. “The government thinks they can’t stop it, so they’ve decided to let people die,” Söderberg-Nauclér said. “They don’t want to listen to the scientific data that’s presented to them. They trust the Public Health Agency [Folkhälsomyndigheten] blindly, but the data they have is weak – embarrassing even. “We are seeing signs of a higher doubling rate than Italy, Stockholm will soon have an acute ICU shortage, and they don’t understand that by then it will be too late to act. All of this is very dangerous.” Tegnell gives such criticism short shrift: “There is no evidence whatsoever that doing more at this stage would make any difference. It’s far better to introduce stringent measures at very specific intervals, and keep them running for as little time as possible.” While there is a constant reappraisal of the situation, Tegnell says Sweden has the crisis under control. “We believe we have the most important measures in place already. Of course, we might have to do more things, but we’re not there yet.” For now, Swedes seem to believe him, going about their daily routines wondering if – not when – that point might be reached. Tegnell and the government have set their course, and while it is hard to doubt their sincerity, it is difficult to reconcile Sweden’s response with efforts across the rest of Europe.

Weeks earlier, his family say, he was spat at by a passenger who refused to pay £9 and told him: “I’ve got the coronavirus – and now you’ve got it, too.”</p> <p>Belle’s partner of 28 years, Kelly Esqulant, with whom he had three children, intends to provide a statement to the police so they can investigate. Esqulant, 50, a patient transport liaison officer at Newham hospital in London, has also written to the prime minister.</p> <p>An <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/trevor-belle"">online fundraiser for Belle</a>, who was described by a friend as an ardent Arsenal fan who would “always find a way to get a smile on your face”, has raised more than £8,000.</p> <p>Esqulant paid tribute to her partner and praised hospital workers who tried to save his life.</p> <p>“He wasn’t a grandad for very long but he would have been a brilliant grandad,” she said of Belle. “He was a very inspirational dad. He always taught the kids right from wrong.”</p> <p>She said he often worked in excess of 60 hours a week to provide for the family. </p> <p>“He was very strong-minded and very truthful. Everyone knew if you wanted the truth, go to Trevor; if you couldn’t handle the truth, don’t go to Trevor. He just said it how it is.” </p> <p>Esqulant acknowledged the family would probably never know whether the spitting incident led to Belle contracting coronavirus. </p> <p>She said she had written to Johnson after he spoke about a separate incident in which a rail worker, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/12/uk-rail-worker-dies-coronavirus-spat-belly-mujinga"">Belly Mujinga</a>, died from Covid-19 after being spat at by a man who said he had the virus. </p> <p>“I don’t even know if he [Johnson] would have received it, but I’ve sent an email explaining what happened to Trevor,” Esqulant said.</p> <p>She said she had pleaded with her partner to be careful while working and ensure he wore gloves and masks, which he would change between fares. </p> <p>She said the spitting incident, first reported in the <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/taxi-driver-partner-died-covid-19-spat-death-will-not-vain/"">Daily Telegraph</a>, happened at around 12.30pm on 22 March on West Ham Lane in Stratford, east London. </p> <p>Belle told Esqulant the perpetrator was white with an Irish accent, and said he ran off after spitting at him.

Trevor Belle, 61, died in hospital last month after testing positive for coronavirus. Weeks earlier, his family say, he was spat at by a passenger who refused to pay £9 and told him: “I’ve got the coronavirus – and now you’ve got it, too.” Belle’s partner of 28 years, Kelly Esqulant, with whom he had three children, intends to provide a statement to the police so they can investigate. Esqulant, 50, a patient transport liaison officer at Newham hospital in London, has also written to the prime minister. An online fundraiser for Belle, who was described by a friend as an ardent Arsenal fan who would “always find a way to get a smile on your face”, has raised more than £8,000. Esqulant paid tribute to her partner and praised hospital workers who tried to save his life. “He wasn’t a grandad for very long but he would have been a brilliant grandad,” she said of Belle. “He was a very inspirational dad. He always taught the kids right from wrong.” She said he often worked in excess of 60 hours a week to provide for the family. “He was very strong-minded and very truthful. Everyone knew if you wanted the truth, go to Trevor; if you couldn’t handle the truth, don’t go to Trevor. He just said it how it is.” Esqulant acknowledged the family would probably never know whether the spitting incident led to Belle contracting coronavirus. She said she had written to Johnson after he spoke about a separate incident in which a rail worker, Belly Mujinga, died from Covid-19 after being spat at by a man who said he had the virus. “I don’t even know if he [Johnson] would have received it, but I’ve sent an email explaining what happened to Trevor,” Esqulant said. She said she had pleaded with her partner to be careful while working and ensure he wore gloves and masks, which he would change between fares. She said the spitting incident, first reported in the Daily Telegraph, happened at around 12.30pm on 22 March on West Ham Lane in Stratford, east London. Belle told Esqulant the perpetrator was white with an Irish accent, and said he ran off after spitting at him. Belle flagged down a nearby police van and reported the incident, Esqulant says, but he was informed the matter was not worth pursuing for a £9 fare. Esqulant says her partner fell ill with flu-like symptoms four days later and he was hospitalised on 31 March after waking up struggling to breathe. On 18 April, the family were told Belle had died. Esqulant has given her consent for a sample of Belle’s blood to be used in a project attempting to sequence the genomes of up to 20,000 Covid-19 patients and victims to help understand how a person’s genetic makeup could influence susceptibility to the virus. Results from patients treated in intensive care will be compared with those from 15,000 people who had only mild or moderate symptoms. Belle had type 2 diabetes.

George create works that challenge the elitism of art, addressing social issues, taboos and conventions. They regularly appear in their own art, having declared themselves ‘living sculptures’. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ Inspired by the backdrop of #London’s East End, where the duo have lived and worked for nearly 50 years, Gilbert &amp;amp; George make art that is both an ongoing portrait of a city and a reflection of the human condition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; White Cube&lt;/a&gt; (@whitecube) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-05-10T17:56:06+00:00&quot;&gt;May 10, 2020 at 10:56am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;""></iframe> <figcaption>Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Walk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first entry on Sunday, they revealed what they call in a handwritten title Our New Normal Walk. Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables.</p> <p>In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There’s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-28339211/hippie-crack-inspires-new-gilbert-and-george-exhibition"">a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters</a> collected on their urban walks.</p> <p>They’ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Relaxing"">  <iframe class=""fenced"" srcdoc=""&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Yet exploring the streets of London has been their life since they met as students in 1967 – taking photographs, picking up unusual objects, observing the people around them. There is no second home for them abroad or in the country – their only residence is the house on Fournier Street in east London where they have lived since the 1960s. So that is where they are holed up. And this week, they are releasing a series of glimpses into their lockdown life, as they unveil their video diary on White Cube’s Instagram account. In the first entry on Sunday, they revealed what they call in a handwritten title Our New Normal Walk. Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables. In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There’s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters collected on their urban walks. They’ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects. In Monday’s video diary, they reveal Our New Normal Relaxing.

George create works that challenge the elitism of art, addressing social issues, taboos and conventions. They regularly appear in their own art, having declared themselves ‘living sculptures’. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ Inspired by the backdrop of #London’s East End, where the duo have lived and worked for nearly 50 years, Gilbert &amp;amp; George make art that is both an ongoing portrait of a city and a reflection of the human condition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/whitecube/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; White Cube&lt;/a&gt; (@whitecube) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-05-10T17:56:06+00:00&quot;&gt;May 10, 2020 at 10:56am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;""></iframe> <figcaption>Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Walk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first entry on Sunday, they revealed what they call in a handwritten title Our New Normal Walk. Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables.</p> <p>In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There’s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-28339211/hippie-crack-inspires-new-gilbert-and-george-exhibition"">a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters</a> collected on their urban walks.</p> <p>They’ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Gilbert and George: Our New Normal Relaxing"">  <iframe class=""fenced"" srcdoc=""&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Yet exploring the streets of London has been their life since they met as students in 1967 – taking photographs, picking up unusual objects, observing the people around them. There is no second home for them abroad or in the country – their only residence is the house on Fournier Street in east London where they have lived since the 1960s. So that is where they are holed up. And this week, they are releasing a series of glimpses into their lockdown life, as they unveil their video diary on White Cube’s Instagram account. In the first entry on Sunday, they revealed what they call in a handwritten title Our New Normal Walk. Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables. In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There’s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters collected on their urban walks. They’ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects. In Monday’s video diary, they reveal Our New Normal Relaxing. Now there is just one long work table. Gilbert lies on one side of it doing exercises in his suit. George sits on the other side in a rocking chair, equally suited, reading a book.

In an interview in the design magazine Dezeen, the influential trend forecaster Li Edelkoort has called it a “quarantine on consumption” that is having a devastating impact on our economy and culture, but ultimately offers “a blank page to a new beginning”. While sections of the fashion industry already knew they could not continue on their current trajectory, it was inconceivable that brands could be forced to slow down, let alone stop production altogether. But that is what has happened as famous names from Prada to Zara have turned their production lines to making medical gowns and masks, and luxury houses have changed from making perfume to sanitisers. It’s an unprecedented interruption of an industry that has relied on speeding from one season’s sales to the next. And it is bringing with it a new sense of connectedness, responsibility and empathy. Until factories started to feel the effects of Covid-19, the global fashion business was producing 150bn items of clothing each year, far in excess of the needs of a global population of 7.9 billion. Clothing consumption globally was in 2017 projected to rise still more, by 63% by 2030, according to the Global Fashion Agenda and Boston Consulting Group. Who knows if those projections will be dented now that bricks-and-mortar shops are closed, orders have halted and supply chains have been stopped in their tracks? As factory orders dry up, the lowly paid, overworked garment workers without sick pay or any financial cushion are the ones who are paying the biggest price. The question is how, when the self-isolation and fear abates, we can use this temporary moratorium on production to correct the course of a carbon-guzzling and exploitative industry. We cannot continue down this path of unchecked overproduction, waste and human misery. On Saturday, people around the world will be reflecting on the temporary decrease in CO2 as they turn off their lights at 8.30pm (local time wherever they are), to take part in Earth Hour. This annual environmental campaign by WWF will remind us that, according to the UN, we have only 10 years to keep global warming to 1.5C.

Every moment will count.” Their argument pivots around the idea that the only way to ensure we cut carbon emissions and end the cycles of overproduction and waste is to imagine a whole new system that places the Earth’s needs before those of industrial growth. In a post-Covid-19 world, that’s beginning to look slightly more feasible. “We propose planet before industry as a radical idea in which the health and survival of our planet Earth is given precedence over business interests,” they write. The coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark focus the fact that business as usual can be stopped in its tracks. Anything, it seems, is now possible. According to the environmental journalist and broadcaster Lucy Siegle, who wrote the foreword to the Earth Logic report, this break is a “lifeline” to the industry and a “chance to reboot our efforts and change our course based on evidence and fact”. “Once we realise that the current system is always going to be self-limiting as there are finite resources, putting Earth first is the only option,” says Fletcher, of the London College of Fashion’s Centre for Sustainable Fashion. This is not about tinkering around the edges of the existing way of working, creating “sustainable” collections or clothing recycling schemes: Earth Logic attacks the very root of the problem: the existing economic model itself. This means a shift from production to the maintenance, use and care of existing clothes. It means reducing the volume of clothes we produce, and in turn, the amount of resources we are using. It means moving from globalised, tangled and unsafe supply chains to small production centres based around the needs and desires of local communities. “We need to find a role for industry scattered across communities,” says Fletcher, with multiple local hubs for people to be educated, to make and repair their clothes. Patriarchy and growth logic are inextricably intertwined, says Tham. The same sorts of people are making the same sorts of decisions. According to Earth Logic, there would be respect for “fashion in non-western geographies. We can train the focus of fashion on supporting race and gender equality. Each perspective offers new models and practices for relating with fashion as well as broadening and diversifying the base of fashion expertise.” These are all points the next generation coming into the industry is demanding, too. “The questions students are asking are very different now,” says Tham, who teaches fashion and economics students at the Linnaeus University, Sweden. How we design clothes must connect with the needs of society and the environment and work with them, not against them. We are seeing this happening with designers looking for ways to help make protective equipment and gowns for medical teams. These new positive role models must be allowed to lead the way forward. We have uncertain and painful times ahead. But Fletcher says: “It’s about trying not to look away when the going gets hard.” We are seeing that in times of real emergency, people’s behaviour has to change. Even pressing pause on fashion’s relentless cycle for a season (possibly two) will have a profound effect. Already, so much has changed. The cycle of fashion for fashion’s sake has been broken. We must use this time to rethink how this industry can be redesigned with respect for the planet and the health of the people who work in it. “It’s like turning a kaleidoscope and seeing new patterns emerge,” says Tham. “There are so many possible patterns. Things can change very quickly when we have a new perspective. It is not impossible.”",6255,false,false,"<a href=""profile/tamsinblanchard"">Tamsin Blanchard</a>",,,,,,,,,2020-03-27,2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,0

This meant they couldn’t move from their hotel in the town of Villa La Angostura in Patagonia. They are still there, unsure of their next move:</p> <p>“Raab is advising us to get home but without any knowledge of whether this is feasible. We are deeply worried that the limited options to get home will disappear before we can get to Buenos Aires, and we will then be stranded here indefinitely.”</p> <p>Argentina went into lockdown on 20 March, until 31 March, and cancelled international flights from countries affected by coronavirus. The Bakers are researching flights to from Buenos Aires to London via Sao Paulo or Rio, but even if they could secure one of those flights, with no internal flights, buses, trains or car hire, they have no way of getting to Buenos Aires , 1,000 miles away.</p> <p>They are currently covering the cost of their accommodation themselves, after their insurance company refused to help. “We are in safe accommodation for now, but are increasingly concerned for the future, especially as the situation will no doubt get worse before it gets better,” said Judith. “We are deeply worried that the limited options to get home will disappear before we can get to Buenos Aires, and we will then be stranded here indefinitely.

On 15 March Peru declared a state of emergency, shutting its borders the following day and cancelling all international flights.</p> <p>“On the first day of the closure we all tried to contact the British embassy, but that had closed. We all felt pretty abandoned at that point,” Nathan said.</p> <p>Since the lockdown he has been staying at the <a href=""https://wildroverhostels.com/cusco/"">Wild Rover hostel</a> in Cusco. “I can’t fault the hostel, it is doing everything possible to make this experience less painful. There are probably about 150 tourists here at the moment. Everyone is pretty fed up. Some people are running out of cash and nobody expected the awful £3,000-plus quotes to fly home.”</p> <p>On Saturday, Raab said he had <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/foreign-office-working-furiously-to-repatriate-400-britons-stranded-in-peru"">secured a flight to bring back British nationals from Peru next week</a>, but Harris is concerned that even when a rescue begins, those stuck in Cusco will be unable to reach the capital, Lima. “Just organising a flight would be pointless if none of us can make it to the airport.

This meant they couldn’t move from their hotel in the town of Villa La Angostura in Patagonia. They are still there, unsure of their next move:</p> <p>“Raab is advising us to get home but without any knowledge of whether this is feasible. We are deeply worried that the limited options to get home will disappear before we can get to Buenos Aires, and we will then be stranded here indefinitely.”</p> <p>Argentina went into lockdown on 20 March, until 31 March, and cancelled international flights from countries affected by coronavirus. The Bakers are researching flights to from Buenos Aires to London via Sao Paulo or Rio, but even if they could secure one of those flights, with no internal flights, buses, trains or car hire, they have no way of getting to Buenos Aires , 1,000 miles away.</p> <p>They are currently covering the cost of their accommodation themselves, after their insurance company refused to help. “We are in safe accommodation for now, but are increasingly concerned for the future, especially as the situation will no doubt get worse before it gets better,” said Judith. “We are deeply worried that the limited options to get home will disappear before we can get to Buenos Aires, and we will then be stranded here indefinitely.

On 15 March Peru declared a state of emergency, shutting its borders the following day and cancelling all international flights.</p> <p>“On the first day of the closure we all tried to contact the British embassy, but that had closed. We all felt pretty abandoned at that point,” Nathan said.</p> <p>Since the lockdown he has been staying at the <a href=""https://wildroverhostels.com/cusco/"">Wild Rover hostel</a> in Cusco. “I can’t fault the hostel, it is doing everything possible to make this experience less painful.

If you have 20 residents and 18 staff and six go down, you don’t want to be doing that.”</p> <p>Care employers must carry out enhanced disclosure checks on staff, which can take weeks to process. A more limited check of whether a potential carer is barred from working with vulnerable people allows them to work immediately but only under supervision.</p> <p>Operators are braced for fatalities and fear that already stretched social care teams could be unable to meet their care duties. A <a href=""http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51"">study in China</a> last month found that the fatality rate among people aged 80 and over was almost 15%, compared with less than 1% among the under-50s.</p> <p>Ahmed said care homes were well practised in controlling infection, but added: “We have to anticipate there will be some fatalities, but it won’t be for want of trying.”</p> <p>One care worker in the east Midlands told the Guardian that plans to parachute staff into affected areas were not realistic. “Most people aren’t going to want to deploy,” said the worker. “You are going to be putting people into a hot zone where people are infected. It creates a vicious circle.”</p> <p>She said carers were not easily transplanted because the people they look after have highly complex needs, and she warned that low pay in the sector meant people were unlikely to tell the truth about whether they feft ill. “They fear they won’t be paid,” she said. “Nobody can survive on statutory sick pay.”</p> <p>Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that workers who self-isolate would be eligible for statutory sick pay from their first day off, rather than their fourth as previously mandated, in order to encourage them to self-isolate.</p> <p>Dave Prentis, the general secretary of the trade union Unison, which represents care workers, welcomed the move but said: “[It] won’t help care staff whose employers are telling them they won’t get paid at all if they go into isolation. Nor will it provide comfort to workers on zero-hours contracts, or those with multiple jobs bringing in less than the £118 weekly threshold at which sick pay kicks in.”</p> <p>Home care providers have reported that some clients have turned care workers away out of fear they may bring infection. Care home managers are encouraging family members to think twice before visiting relatives and to stay in touch by phone.</p> <p>“It is difficult for our services because in hospitals you can close down wards but we are trying to keep these places as a home from home,” said Ahmed. “We are doing our best to meet our residents’ social needs and that means visiting. If you have a level of dementia, you need routine. If someone doesn’t come in, the impact could be quite emotionally difficult.”</p> <p>Her advice to relatives is: “Make sure you don’t have a temperature, and if you are unsure, don’t come in. We are saying to people to call [by phone] a bit more often.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was working with care providers, directors of adult social services and local government to make “the best possible preparations”.</p> <p>They added: “The UK is extremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks and Public Health England has issued tailored guidance for care providers setting out action to be taken in a variety of circumstances.” </p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '7', 'wordcount': '836', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-03-04T19:19:53Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-03-18T10:57:23Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-03-05T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dd2va', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cf02f0e5b602a5278b6873431071383bd97b6e51/75_0_3307_1984/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'Care workers could be redeployed to look after elderly people in coronavirus hotspots across the UK as officials investigate whether criminal records checks need to be loosened to fill vacancies left by sick carers.

The Department of Health and Social Care has asked providers whether the system of obligatory background checks for workers who have close physical contact with vulnerable people is a barrier to implementing the emergency plan, care industry sources said. Altering the requirement could also allow people who have recently left care work or retirees whose background checks have expired to be drafted back in without the usual weeks-long wait for approval, according to a Whitehall source. Care bosses have said that without emergency measures the projected levels of infection in the UK could force homes to close and residents to be moved to NHS facilities, causing considerable distress and increasing the burden on already stretched clinical services. The sick rate among care workers is usually under 3% but if the government’s predictions that a fifth of the population could be off work become a reality then the care sector could be depleted by about 220,000 workers. “If [staff] have to self-isolate, we will see massive challenges in the sector,” said Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, which represents more than 600 small and medium-sized care homes. “The regulations say you must have enough staff to deliver the service based on assessed need. If you have 20 residents and 18 staff and six go down, you don’t want to be doing that.” Care employers must carry out enhanced disclosure checks on staff, which can take weeks to process. A more limited check of whether a potential carer is barred from working with vulnerable people allows them to work immediately but only under supervision. Operators are braced for fatalities and fear that already stretched social care teams could be unable to meet their care duties. A study in China last month found that the fatality rate among people aged 80 and over was almost 15%, compared with less than 1% among the under-50s. Ahmed said care homes were well practised in controlling infection, but added: “We have to anticipate there will be some fatalities, but it won’t be for want of trying.” One care worker in the east Midlands told the Guardian that plans to parachute staff into affected areas were not realistic. “Most people aren’t going to want to deploy,” said the worker. “You are going to be putting people into a hot zone where people are infected. It creates a vicious circle.” She said carers were not easily transplanted because the people they look after have highly complex needs, and she warned that low pay in the sector meant people were unlikely to tell the truth about whether they feft ill. “They fear they won’t be paid,” she said. “Nobody can survive on statutory sick pay.” Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that workers who self-isolate would be eligible for statutory sick pay from their first day off, rather than their fourth as previously mandated, in order to encourage them to self-isolate. Dave Prentis, the general secretary of the trade union Unison, which represents care workers, welcomed the move but said: “[It] won’t help care staff whose employers are telling them they won’t get paid at all if they go into isolation. Nor will it provide comfort to workers on zero-hours contracts, or those with multiple jobs bringing in less than the £118 weekly threshold at which sick pay kicks in.” Home care providers have reported that some clients have turned care workers away out of fear they may bring infection. Care home managers are encouraging family members to think twice before visiting relatives and to stay in touch by phone. “It is difficult for our services because in hospitals you can close down wards but we are trying to keep these places as a home from home,” said Ahmed. “We are doing our best to meet our residents’ social needs and that means visiting. If you have a level of dementia, you need routine. If someone doesn’t come in, the impact could be quite emotionally difficult.” Her advice to relatives is: “Make sure you don’t have a temperature, and if you are unsure, don’t come in. We are saying to people to call [by phone] a bit more often.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was working with care providers, directors of adult social services and local government to make “the best possible preparations”. They added: “The UK is extremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks and Public Health England has issued tailored guidance for care providers setting out action to be taken in a variety of circumstances.”', 'charCount': '4928', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/robertbooth"">Robert Booth</a> Social affairs correspondent'}","[{'id': 'society/care-workers', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Care workers', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/care-workers', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/care-workers', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/social-care', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Social care', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/social-care', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/society', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Society', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/robertbooth', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Robert Booth', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertbooth', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertbooth', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Robert Booth is social affairs correspondent of the Guardian.

Hilda is the only one who has read the book: it’s “half-funny” she tells us. “George is naughty,” she adds, excitedly. “He does everything he’s not told to.” So when Harris leaves George home alone for the day, guess what happens to the delicious cake? And Harris’s prize-winning plants? And is that a puppet cat strolling into view? Oh no, George … Red of fur, droopy of ear and utterly irrepressible, Rosy Roberts is a delight, whether clinging to the long-suffering Harris (David Insua-Cao) or disappearing headfirst into a bin. “He’s a bit more purple in the book,” thinks Hilda, but we love the George costume made by Ruth Watkin. Laura McEwen’s wonky-walled set design matches the offbeat humour and, in an inspired move, Insua-Cao doubles as a drummer, providing a frantic rhythm to accompany George’s boundless enthusiasm. One clever bit of commotion ends with a pile of furniture spelling out Oh No. George and Harris share a quick-stepping, bum-scratching dance duet when they go walkies and in another super routine, you’ll believe a dog can fly. This 45-minute recording was made in a studio space for archive purposes rather than to be watched at home and is rudimentary: it’s like watching from the back row, and you wish for more closeups of the actors’ expressions. There are a couple of lulls, and I’d imagined any audience interaction would fall flat when you’re sat in front of a computer rather than amid the mayhem. However, the actors provoke some sparky retorts from the kids in the theatre, and both my girls find these bits hilarious. The show is designed for three- to eight-year-olds and aside from some stern warnings from Harris it’s mostly wordless, though Insua-Cao delivers lyrics while pounding the drum kit. The finale, which answers the book’s final question and involves all the kids in the auditorium, makes Hilda sigh: “I wish I was in the audience.” This is a fantastic introduction to a company we can’t wait to experience live. Available from Half Moon theatre until 13 May.",2515,false,true,"<a href=""profile/chriswiegand"">Chris Wiegand</a>",2020-06-05T23:00:00Z,,,,,,,,2020-05-06,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

The government has defended its decision, arguing that the country’s early lockdown allowed it to assess Ghana’s needs, and that it bought the authorities time to boost health infrastructure, testing capacity, and pinpoint where the outbreaks were. In his speech announcing an easing of the lockdown, the president promised to improve testing. “We are ranked number one in Africa in the administering of tests per million people,” he said. The government said it was starting the largest investment in the country’s healthcare, with 96 new hospitals planned for the next year and improved services. Ghana’s information minister, Kojo Nkrumah, told the Guardian the lockdown had helped the government to assess its health systems and what the country would need, based on increased data collection from Covid-19 tests. “We decided not to wait but to do a precautionary lockdown early and within that period get mass findings and data to help us,” he said. About 110,000 tests were administered. The government has increased its supply of ventilators, said Nkrumah, to around 200. Among the first 1,200 patients fewer than five required intensive care or ventilation. According to Nkrumah, the length and function of lockdowns had to be decided by individual countries. “We should guard against assuming that there is a one size fits all approach. You should let the local context be applied when enforcing these lockdowns,” he said. But pressure to ease the restrictions was mounting before the president made the decision. Ghana’s powerful Trade Union Congress had pressed Addo to adopt a different strategy. “Nearly 90% of Ghanaians work in the informal economy,” the secretary general, Anthony Baah, told the Guardian. “In a lockdown the impact can become unbearable, so we are happy with what the government has done.” And just days after the lockdown was imposed at the end of March, pockets of demonstrations broke out in Ghana. Traders protesting in a market in Kasoa, western Accra, said they knew the lockdown was needed to curb the spread of the virus but they were not in a position to survive it. “The president’s directive is good but it won’t help us,” said one. The mass outcry so early on during the lockdown was a worry for the government, particularly in what is supposed to be an election year. Many fear the government has been too hasty. Seizing the moment, former president John Mahama sparked the sparked the criticism in a tweet before Addo’s announcement. “Concerns persist that the government has taken a gamble,” he said. “Many health experts continue to suggest the necessity and appropriateness of an extension of the restrictions.”",5138,false,false,"<a href=""profile/emmanuel-akinwotu"">Emmanuel Akinwotu</a> and Kwasi Asiedu in Accra",,,,,,,,,2020-05-03,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

Ironically, it’s probably those libertarians howling loudest for an end to lockdown now who’d naturally hate the idea, while for others it will sound like a price worth paying for escape. Right now, I’d probably download it like a shot. But until some basic questions are answered, we just don’t know what we might be sacrificing for freedom. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",4493,false,false,"<a href=""profile/gabyhinsliff"">Gaby Hinsliff</a>",2020-04-15T10:00:00Z,,,,,,,,2020-04-15,2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,0

Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return.</p> \n<p>So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets.</p> \n<p>For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed.</p> \n<figure class=""element element-atom""> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=""bec38c7e-4c90-4d90-9f12-e5d02ade213e"" data-atom-type=""media""> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cohpBp316i8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0""></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnsons-post-coronavirus-speech-what-he-said-what-it-means"">our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus</a>. What part of a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe"">death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe</a> – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible.</p> \n<p>From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans?</p> \n<p>Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up.

Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return. So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets. For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed. Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court. It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus. What part of a death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible. From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans? Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up. That he was essentially a prime minister for the Good Times, someone to lift spirits with delusional appeals to jingoism. All of which could take place in a moral vacuum of no consequences for him.

The usual regime in prisons has been suspended, meaning inmates can no longer take part in recreational activities, visit libraries, go to worship or receive visits from friends or family. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) visited three young offender institutions (YOIs) on 21 April – Parc, near Bridgend, Cookham Wood, in Kent, and Wetherby in West Yorkshire – as part of a programme of short inspections to assess the functioning of the prison estate during the pandemic. Inspectors found inconsistencies across the three YOIs, which hold around 400 15- to 17-year-olds, in their approaches to the new restrictive regime. Only Parc was continuing to provide face-to-face education, and children there received more than three hours out of their cell each day. However, the children in Cookham Wood were spending just 40 minutes out of their cells each day, while inmates at Wetherby were out of their cells for about an hour. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said: “While a reduction in time unlocked was inevitable, the variation between establishments was a concern and raised the question of the need for, and therefore the proportionality of, the most restrictive regimes.” He added: “The government’s advice is that those who are deemed vulnerable should be able to attend education in the community. Most children held in custody would meet this definition, and the leaders of all three establishments had wanted to deliver at least some education within public health guidance, so it is hard to see the justification for why such different approaches had been taken.” There have been warnings from penal reform campaigners and the shadow frontbench that the restrictive regime is not sustainable in the long term, despite evidence that it is helping to contain “explosive outbreaks” across the estate. Public Health England has said to date the number of confirmed cases and deaths within prisons has not been as high as expected. At least 19 prisoners and six prison staff have contracted Covid-19 and died. Inspectors said the children held in the three YOIs were frustrated that they could not see their friends and families. Children were provided with additional phone credit, although there were was a “significant difference” in the amounts given at each establishment, for which the inspectors could not find an explanation. Clarke said managers at all three sites had been slow to implement video calling, which was available only in Parc at the time of the inspection. All new arrivals, numbers of whom have significantly fallen since the start of the pandemic, are being separated from the rest of the population for 14 days. Newly arrived children could only see and speak with others who had arrived on the same day, the inspectorate said, so for those arriving by themselves there was no face-to-face interaction with other children for 14 days. Despite the concerns, Clarke said it was generally a positive set of inspections, with staff found to be interacting with children in a caring, patient and professional way. All three sites were calm and well ordered, with sufficient staff, the report said, and self-harm had reduced at Parc and Wetherby and was stable at Cookham Wood A Youth Custody Service spokesperson said: “Inspectors found the young offender institutions have responded swiftly to contain the spread of Covid-19 and keep children and staff safe.

These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.”</p> \n<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show"">Care workers and home carers</a> had higher death rates than the general population, with 23.4 deaths for every 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths for every 100,000 women. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate than the wider population.</p> \n<p>The figures indicate death rates are significantly higher in occupations where physical distancing is difficult, including construction, manufacturing and primary education.</p> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We already know that risk factors for dying from Covid-19 include, for example, being male, having underlying conditions, and ethnicity. The ONS data suggests certain occupations may be more at risk than others. So, taking the points above, a ‘male diabetic Asian bus driver’ is at higher risk than a ‘female healthy Caucasian company director’ of similar age.</p> \n<p>“There is much still to disentangle around Covid-19 risk factors and how best to use that information to manage aspects such as population return to work. However, right now the forthcoming guidance for safe working simply has to provide extensive detail on how each sector is expected to manage their staff and working environments.

Men in low-skilled jobs are four times more likely to die from the virus than men in professional occupations, while women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles. The findings have prompted calls for clear guidance for employers and employees as the government called for people who could not work from home to return to work. Men in low-skilled jobs are almost four times more likely to die from coronavirus than professionals, with 21.4 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 5.6 among white-collar male workers. Security guards, care workers, construction workers, plant operatives, cleaners, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail workers are all at a greater risk of dying, according to the analysis of Covid-19 fatalities in England and Wales up to 20 April from the Office for National Statistics. John Phillips, the acting general secretary of the GMB trade union, said the figures were “horrifying”. “If you are low-paid and working through the Covid-19 crisis, you are more likely to die – that’s how stark these figures are. Ministers must pause any return to work until proper guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe,” he said. Among people of working age, men (9.9 deaths per 100,000) are at a greater risk of dying from the virus than women (4.2 per 100,000). The figures show men working in the lowest-skilled jobs face the greatest risk of dying from the virus when compared to the wider working population. Men working as security guards had one of the highest death rates, at 45.7 fatalities for every 100,000, followed by taxi drivers and chauffeurs (36.4), bus and coach drivers (26.4), chefs (35.9), and sales and retail assistants (19.8). Men working as process, plant and machine operatives had a rate of 37.7 and low-skilled construction workers – who have been permitted to work throughout the lockdown – a rate of 25.9. Neil Pearce, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: “In the working-age population, Covid-19 is largely an occupational disease. This is not just for healthcare and social care workers, but for many other occupations that involve contact with people ... These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.” Care workers and home carers had higher death rates than the general population, with 23.4 deaths for every 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths for every 100,000 women. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate than the wider population. The figures indicate death rates are significantly higher in occupations where physical distancing is difficult, including construction, manufacturing and primary education. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We already know that risk factors for dying from Covid-19 include, for example, being male, having underlying conditions, and ethnicity. The ONS data suggests certain occupations may be more at risk than others. So, taking the points above, a ‘male diabetic Asian bus driver’ is at higher risk than a ‘female healthy Caucasian company director’ of similar age. “There is much still to disentangle around Covid-19 risk factors and how best to use that information to manage aspects such as population return to work. However, right now the forthcoming guidance for safe working simply has to provide extensive detail on how each sector is expected to manage their staff and working environments. Employers and employees need that reassurance.” The Guardian has previously reported that black and ethic minority (BAME) people in England and Wales are dying at a higher rate than white people. BAME workers are over-represented in high-risk occupations, including transport, health and social care sectors. Covid-19 death rates are also higher in the most deprived parts of England and Wales. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies said the ONS figures highlighted the plight of BAME workers, who were more likely to work in frontline services than white workers. Neil Carbery, the chief executive of the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said employers must carry out a health and safety risk assessment before they could claim to have a Covid-19-safe operation that could welcome back workers. The ONS findings were adjusted for age but do not take ethnicity, place of residence and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and obesity into consideration.

In recent days I’ve had that sense more than once. Every time I come home, remove my mask and wash my hands, I start thinking whether it is safe to keep on wearing the clothes that I had on outside. What if they are contaminated by the virus? Well, I can change clothes, but what if the particles have already jumped somewhere else, and are now in my home? Some would call it paranoia. I call it deja vu. I recognise those thoughts and remember the feelings.</p> <p>That is because I first experienced them more than 30 years ago, in May 1986, on a trip to Kyiv, then the capital of Soviet Ukraine. It was a few weeks after the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, and I was in the city – about 100km from the disaster area – on a business trip. We already knew that there was radiation in the air. Water trucks were spraying the streets, foreign students were leaving the city, and overseas broadcasters like the BBC were telling us to stay inside.

As it struggled to deal with a homegrown disaster that was becoming international, Beijing in 2019 closely resembled Moscow in 1986. Like Moscow’s terse initial report about the Chernobyl disaster, Beijing’s announcement about the outbreak of Covid-19 came late, was incomplete, and had all the hallmarks of a coverup. Like the Soviet Union responding to the Chernobyl explosion, China mobilised huge domestic resources and introduced draconian measures to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. But neither of the two governments, which happened to be communist and authoritarian in different degrees, managed to stop the spread of the disaster and information about it beyond their borders. And the misleading reports and mismanagement then produced a backlash among foreign governments and the general public throughout the world. China, which pretended to the status of world leader in matters of globalisation and climate change only a few months before the Wuhan disaster, has had its reputation damaged. It also faces trillion-dollar class-action lawsuits originating in the United States and calls for a billion dollars in reparations from Germany. However effective they are at mobilising resources to deal with disasters, authoritarian regimes turn out to be too effective for their own good in controlling information. Lack of freedom of speech helps to turn potential disasters into real ones and national tragedies into international cataclysms. But as we try to contain the “fallout” of coronavirus, many are already asking what steps we might take to better prepare ourselves next time, and avoid the next tragedy taking the same trajectory. So far, the response has been almost exclusively nation-based. Borders have been closed and fingers pointed, not just at China but at international institutions as well. President Trump has suspended funding for the World Health Organization, blaming it, at least in part, for the failure to contain the virus. While temporary border closures have their practical purposes, national self-isolation accompanied by a blame game that undermines multilateral organisations is neither a way out of the current pandemic nor a template for dealing with future disasters. Instead, the way forward, as demonstrated by lessons learned from Chernobyl, is through coordinated action. While some take aim at WHO for its cosy relationship with the Chinese government, it’s worth remembering that the the International Atomic Energy Agency, rightly criticised at the time for facilitating the Soviet coverup of Chernobyl, eventually became the instrument by which Moscow came clean about what happened. It led the international effort to open the Soviet nuclear industry to the world and helped to introduce safety standards behind the iron curtain. A number of international legal instruments to ensure that there is early warning of nuclear accidents were adopted in the aftermath of Chernobyl, as were various measures to heighten the safety of the nuclear industry. It is my personal conviction that without those measures we would have had further Chernobyl-type accidents in the former Soviet space. Legal experts suggest that the lawsuits being prepared in the US will go nowhere, given the nature of international law and foreign governments’ liabilities under it. And one need not be an expert to realise that cutting funds to international institutions such as the WHO in today’s interconnected world is extremely damaging. On the contrary, we need to strengthen international institutions in their capacity to fight pandemics and provide the WHO with a stronger mandate to act in closed societies such as China. The only effective responses to international disasters, no matter which state they occur in, are international. As the world’s reaction to Chernobyl showed, coordinated efforts can bring real change, making us all safer – whether we live in Beijing, Moscow, London or New York. That’s the kind of deja vu I’d like to be experiencing right now. • Serhii Plokhy is professor of history at Harvard University and the author of Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy",6961,false,false,"<a href=""profile/serhii-plokhy"">Serhii Plokhy</a>",2020-05-05T17:30:00Z,,1,2020-05-06T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-05-05,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

Just weeks ago almost no one outside the Tory party – and precious few within it – had heard of Rishi Sunak, but he has now become one of the cabinet’s few beacons of sanity and competence. You just have to suspend disbelief rather. It’s disconcerting to have a chancellor who looks younger than most teenagers and is so small that he has to peer round the sides of the Downing Street lectern as he can’t see over the top. “We must be honest with the British people,” Sunak said with his best honest man-of-the-people face, as he addressed the latest Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. Though not quite so honest that he could actually bring himself to spell out that the OBR was predicting a possible 35% fall in GDP with two million unemployed for the next three months. Only that it was just one forecast that could easily be wrong and even if it wasn’t then he wouldn’t sit around and let it happen. Sunak has already delivered five separate budgets inside two months and you could almost see him writing his sixth and seventh as he was speaking. Many chancellors don’t get to deliver that many in their entire political career. Sunak is on course to easily break double figures by the end of the year. Now was not the time for ideology or orthodoxy, he added, rather pointing out the obvious. Those horses have long since bolted. “It’s not a choice between the economy and public health,” he concluded. Here he was sticking his neck out. There are quite a few of his cabinet colleagues who might beg to differ if they start to see the end of the Brexit transition receding further into the distance. Not all the media shared Rishi’s faith in his own abilities. He might be the best of a bad bunch but the gene pool of ministerial talent wasn’t exactly overloaded. Sunak tried to insist the UK would bounce back and that the government was committed to levelling up opportunities for everyone, but it was hard to see many winners in the coronavirus pandemic other than the hedge fund managers who had bet on a stock market collapse. “We’re all in this together,” Rishi insisted, before bitterly regretting his choice of words. David Cameron had said exactly that back in 2012 and in the intervening years the NHS and public services had been cut and the gap in inequality widened. The chronicle of more deaths foretold. Nor was there much faith in the way the UK reported its statistics, as it was now clear our mortality rate would be higher than France’s if we included deaths in care homes and the community. Luckily, Sunak could palm this off to the two medical officers who insisted this was a blip and that they personally longed for the day when the charts had the UK outperforming Italy and Spain. The most telling question, though, was what they might have done differently in hindsight. On that they were all agreed. They would never have signed up to a daily press briefing. This one will run and run. As they all did for the exit.",5576,false,false,"<a href=""profile/johncrace"">John Crace</a>",2020-04-15T00:00:00Z,,,,,,,,2020-04-14,2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,0
