Whistler was unaware that Franklin had modelled for this painting until he attended a private view at the Paris Salon. Image: Gallery Oldham, 2:C - Sarah Lees was a leading philanthropist who became the Mayor of Oldham in 1910. She was the second woman in the UK to take up this role after the suffragist Elizabeth Garrett Anderson became mayor of Aldeburgh in 1908. Image: © the artist’s estate/Gallery Oldham, 3:C - Waterhouse completed this painting –&nbsp;Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysses – in 1891. It depicts a scene from the Odyssey, where the sorceress Circe offers Odysseus (or Ulysses) a magical potion that will bring him under her spell and turn him into a pig. A crewman, magically transformed into a pig, can be seen beside Circe’s feet. Image: Gallery Oldham, 4:B - Albert Toft (1862–1949) agreed not to repeat this design on any sculpture within a 25-mile radius of Oldham. The central figure was used again in his memorial for the Royal Fusiliers in Holborn, London. Image: Gallery&nbsp;Oldham, 5:D - Damilola is a close friend of the artist who helped him when he first moved to the UK. Gallery Oldham is the only museum in the UK to hold a painting by Titus Agbara. Image: © Titus Agbara/Gallery Oldham, 6:C - Estella Olive West was better known as Stella West. She sat for Auerbach over 23 years, one of the few models that he chose to paint time and time again. Image: © the artist/Gallery Oldham, 7:C - The Bangladeshi artist is known for her paintings focusing on the lives of women and ethnic minorities from her home country.

Nancy Pelosi, the senior Democrat in Congress, appeared on MSNBC with a painting thick with brush strokes and swipes of colour. After some <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qUrMSnL5H/"">online sleuthing</a> it emerged that it was by the Chicago artist Wesley Kimler (who confirmed it in a comment under Higgs’s Instagram post).</p> <p>“All of sudden we have these glimpses of other people’s realities that we normally wouldn’t have access to,” says Higgs.</p> <p>Art has always been interwoven with the wider culture in unexpected ways. Higgs points to <a href=""https://www.petzel.com/exhibitions/allan-mccollum2"">Allan McCollum</a> who, in his Perpetual Photos series from the 1980s, took snapshots of his television whenever he saw a framed artwork on screen, and would then enlarge that image. In 1993, the German artist Timm Ulrichs published a book, <em>Kunst und Leben </em>(Art and Life), that collected images from old pornographic magazines where reproductions of famous art were visible in the background. “It’s thinking about domestic space and how culture finds its way into those spaces,” says Higgs.</p> <p>In the mid 90s, the conceptual artist Mel Chin persuaded the makers of the LA-based soap opera <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/arts/design/the-plot-to-put-conceptual-art-on-melrose-place-yes-really.html"">Melrose Place</a> to let him create original art, objects and props to be placed in the backgrounds of sets, in characters’ homes and workplaces. Chin put together a 100-strong team of largely unknown artists, billing themselves as the Gala Committee, to make art for the show – often bearing subversive or topical messages. In 2016 it was displayed in a gallery show.</p> <p>Today, the art world is trying desperately hard to reach house-bound audiences. The larger galleries are providing some remote access to their collections and big shows, or attempting educational offerings. Commercial galleries have set up online “viewing rooms” – a number of small galleries in London have teamed with behemoth dealer David Zwirner to create such a <a href=""https://www.davidzwirner.com/viewing-room/platform-london"">platform</a>; there’s a <a href=""https://www.davidzwirner.com/viewing-room/platform-new-york"">New York</a> version, too.

Higgs points to Allan McCollum who, in his Perpetual Photos series from the 1980s, took snapshots of his television whenever he saw a framed artwork on screen, and would then enlarge that image. In 1993, the German artist Timm Ulrichs published a book, Kunst und Leben (Art and Life), that collected images from old pornographic magazines where reproductions of famous art were visible in the background. “It’s thinking about domestic space and how culture finds its way into those spaces,” says Higgs. In the mid 90s, the conceptual artist Mel Chin persuaded the makers of the LA-based soap opera Melrose Place to let him create original art, objects and props to be placed in the backgrounds of sets, in characters’ homes and workplaces. Chin put together a 100-strong team of largely unknown artists, billing themselves as the Gala Committee, to make art for the show – often bearing subversive or topical messages. In 2016 it was displayed in a gallery show. Today, the art world is trying desperately hard to reach house-bound audiences. The larger galleries are providing some remote access to their collections and big shows, or attempting educational offerings. Commercial galleries have set up online “viewing rooms” – a number of small galleries in London have teamed with behemoth dealer David Zwirner to create such a platform; there’s a New York version, too. Elsewhere, places such as the ICA are sending out daily emails with notes on art ephemera, culture tips and everything in between. Meanwhile, there’s still art to be found on TV. Recent Instagram updates from Higgs and others pointed to a CNN interview with Sean Combs – AKA P Diddy – in front of a painting by the Chicago-based artist Kerry James Marshall. The work, Past Times, was bought by the rap mogul in 2018 for $21.1m. “I live in New York and I go to see galleries all the time,” says Higgs. “I take my dog for a walk around galleries. I miss that in-person perambulatory relationship with culture. So that was one of the nice things about seeing this stuff on the background of the news – culture found a way to creep back into your life.”', 'charCount': '5032', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false',

A subsequent resistance exercise indicated he had a coeliac allergy, which led to him relinquishing gluten from his diet and conquering the world. He <a href=""https://www.shortlist.com/news/novak-djokovic-transcendence-interview"">calls</a> telekinesis and telepathy “gifts from this higher order, the source, the god, whatever, that allows us to understand the higher power and higher order in ourselves”. He once hired a coach, Pepe Imaz, who probably taught him about telepathy and levitation, and whose techniques include extremely long hugs.</p> <p>Evidently, Djokovic’s outlook has worked for him. He is the world No 1 on a 21-match winning run who is in pursuit of Rafael Nadal (19) and Roger Federer (20) in terms of grand slam titles, with 17. He will probably get there.

I will have to make a decision.”</p> <p>Enter Djokovic’s wife, Jelena, who at the beginning of April <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-c3GrrDoPT/"">spread the viral video</a> of medical professional Dr Thomas Cowan and his debunked theory linking 5G technology to the coronavirus outbreak. The video now carries a “false information” badge of shame on her Instagram.

Videos such as Cowan’s have led to the vandalisation of numerous 5G masts.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak has underlined how personal decisions universally have the potential to affect many different people.

Djokovic spoke slowly and deliberately in response: “Gratitude and prayer, a couple of long, deep breaths, hugging my wife and running to my children.” Murray nodded limply, he successfully kept a straight face and at some point he even awkwardly uttered: “Nice!” Then he gave his own answer: “For me, too much information, but I go for a pee.” The nature of Djokovic’s job means that he speaks about himself after every single match, but normally he focuses his monologues on the tennis. It is easy to forget about how different his world view is to the rivals who surround him. According to Djokovic, his career was defined by the day a doctor placed a slice of white bread on his stomach. A subsequent resistance exercise indicated he had a coeliac allergy, which led to him relinquishing gluten from his diet and conquering the world. He calls telekinesis and telepathy “gifts from this higher order, the source, the god, whatever, that allows us to understand the higher power and higher order in ourselves”. He once hired a coach, Pepe Imaz, who probably taught him about telepathy and levitation, and whose techniques include extremely long hugs. Evidently, Djokovic’s outlook has worked for him. He is the world No 1 on a 21-match winning run who is in pursuit of Rafael Nadal (19) and Roger Federer (20) in terms of grand slam titles, with 17. He will probably get there. His spirituality should be personal as long as it is not harmful. However, on Sunday afternoon as he congregated on Zoom with fellow Serbian athletes for a public discussion about the fate of their sports, Djokovic’s comments reflected how thin the line is between finding solace in spirituality and potentially projecting dangerous narratives. “Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” he said. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.” Enter Djokovic’s wife, Jelena, who at the beginning of April spread the viral video of medical professional Dr Thomas Cowan and his debunked theory linking 5G technology to the coronavirus outbreak. The video now carries a “false information” badge of shame on her Instagram. Instead of being one of the many to share a false video innocently, she doubled down. Djokovic’s comments slip seamlessly into everything he has ever projected about his lifestyle and world view, but they also align with the dangerous way that anti-vaxxers discuss these issues and his wishes are dangerous. Videos such as Cowan’s have led to the vandalisation of numerous 5G masts. The coronavirus outbreak has underlined how personal decisions universally have the potential to affect many different people. Djokovic is no Keri Hilson – a minor celebrity who helped to spread 5G conspiracy theories – he is one of the most famous people in Serbia and opposing vaccinations carries an even greater danger. While they have also thrown his future into question, this stance seems reminiscent of his ideological opposition to surgery, which led to his split with Andre Agassi in 2017 after he resisted medical intervention and thought his elbow would heal with alternative, holistic treatments. Djokovic finally underwent surgery in 2018 and when he awoke, he cried for three days. “Every time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself,” he told the Telegraph.

Typical pay for workers in shutdown sectors is less than half that of those able to work from home – £348 a week compared to £707 a week.<br><br></li> \n   <li>Those in shutdown sectors are younger – their average age of 39 is four years below the average age of those who can work from home.

European stock markets have hit their highest levels in seven weeks, despite another torrent of bad economic data. Hopes that the Covid-19 lockdowns will soon ease have lifted shares again today, with Britain’s FTSE 100 gaining almost 2% and solid gains across Europe. The rally came despite a series of grim reports, that confirmed the world economy is entering a deep recession. US consumer confidence suffered a record plunge, hitting its lowest level in five years. Americans reported that their current economic situation has worsened dramatically this month, although they’re a little more optimistic about the future than a month ago UK retailers reported that sales had taken a dive in April, with even grocers saying turnover was lower than a year ago (after a surge in March). With lockdowns likely to be lifted gradually, UBS forecast that the eurozone recession would be even deeper than first thought. With energy demand weak, the oil price came under further pressure. The price of a barrel of US crude oil for June delivery is currently down 6.5% at $11.95 per barrel. Oil giant BP reported that its earnings plunged in the first three months of this year, due to low oil prices. It said Covid-19 was helping to create an unprecedented crisis for the energy industry. Banking group HSBC also shone a light on the economic cost of the crisis, by putting aside $3bn to cover bad loans - and warning the bill could reach $11bn. Goodnight. GW Earlier today, UK’s financial watchdog fired a warning shot at Britain’s banks not to pressure corporate clients to give them work in return for financial assistance in the crisis. The FCA suspects that some banks have been demanding to take part in lucrative jobs such as share sales, in return for agreeing to emergency loans. Pretty unprofessional if so! Europe’s investors have shaken off the latest weak economic data, pushing shares higher across the region. Trading has just ended, with Britain’s FTSE 100 up 111 points of 1.9% at 5958, a seven-week high. Lloyds Bank was the top performer today, gaining almost 9% (up to the giddy heights of 33p), followed by JD Sports (up 8.5%). Cruise operator Carnival gained 8%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index closed 1.5% higher, with all the major indices up. France’s CAC gained 1.3%, as prime minister Edouard Philippe outlined plans to ease its lockdown from May 11. Schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations, Philippe told parliament. However, restaurants and cafes will remain closed until at least early June and professional sports, including soccer, will not begin again until the autumn. Interestingly.... the rally on Wall Street is somewhat fizzling out. The Dow is now down 0.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has dropped by 1%. Perhaps investors are fretting that today’s slump in consumer confidence doesn’t bode terribly well for the economy this year. Especially as stocks have already rebounded strongly in recent weeks.... Here’s a neat chart showing the recent divergence between the US stock market and consumer confidence. We’ll find out in a month’s time whether they’ve converged again - either through a drop in stocks or a rise in confidence.... (or maybe both!) US economist David Rosenberg feels the plunge in US consumer confidence is rather at odds with the recent stock market rally. Economist Rupert Seggins feels Americans aren’t nearly anxious enough! There is one glimmer of hope in the US consumer confidence report -- Americans are a little less pessimistic than a month ago. The ‘future expectations’ index, which asks people how they feel about the next six months, actually improved to 93.8 from 86.8 in March. That suggests that the US public may be looking forward to lockdown rules being lifted soon. But it was more than cancelled out by the record slump in how people feel about the economy right now (the current conditions index, which plunged to 76.4 from 166.7). Stock markets have actually pushed higher since the US consumer confidence figures were released. The UK’s FTSE 100 index is now up 124 points or 2% at 5969 points, on track to close at its highest level in seven weeks. Roughly one in six Americans expect their income to decline over the next six months, today’s consumer confidence report shows. Oof! US consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in nearly six years, as the Covid-19 pandemic spooks Americans. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has slumped to 86.9 for April, the lowest since June 2014. That’s down from 120 points in March -- a truly dramatic (but not unsurprising) slide. The Conference Board’s assessment of the current economic situation fell especially sharply - in response to the surge in jobless claims across America, and the widespread lockdowns of factories and offices. Wall Street has hit a near seven-week high at the start of trading, matching the move in London today. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 314 points, or 1.3%, to 24,448, its highest level since Wednesday 11th March (during the worst week of the 2020 crash). Investors seem to be increasingly optimistic that the lockdowns which have caused such economic pain in recent weeks will ease soon, with the massive central bank money-printing operations likely to support asset prices too. America’s trade deficit has widened, partly due to a collapse in sales of new cars and industrial equipment to overseas customers. The Commerce Department has reported that the gap between the goods bought and sold by the US expanded by 7.2% last month to $64.2bn. Although Americans did buy less from abroad, that was more than countered by a drop in exports. Reuters has the details: In March, goods imports dropped 2.4% to $191.9 billion after decreasing 2.5% in February. There were sharp decreases in imports of consumer goods and motor vehicles and parts. Imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods rose last month. Exports of goods tumbled 6.7% to $127.6 billion in March. There was a broad decline in exports last month, with shipments of industrial supplies dropping 7.5% and motor vehicles and parts plummeting 17.8%. The volume of cargo being transported around the world by air tumbled by 15% in March, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), less than during the global financial crisis in 2008 when volumes fell by 23%. Airlines suffering a 30% decline in passenger travel are quickly trying to repurpose passenger aircraft, or bring freight airplanes out of storage in order to fly goods including medical supplies and pharmaceuticals around the world, according to the industry body. However IATA expects the volume of cargo flown around the world to fall during 2020 as the expected recession reduces consumers’ demand for goods. Sales at mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Caterpillar has reported that sales slumped by 21% in the first three months of 2020, as the global economy seized up. Revenues fell to $10.6bn, down from $13.5bn, due to “lower end user demand” Profit fell sharply too, from $2.94 per share a year ago to $1.60 per share -- below forecasts of $1.69. Caterpillar is not providing any full-year 2020 guidance due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Here’s our news story on April’s retail sales figures: The recent recovery in stock markets came after central banks and governments launched huge new rescue packages to help businesses and individuals survive the lockdown. This video explainer runs through the various schemes, and explains the risks.... More gloom: The U.K. economy isn’t expected to return to its pre-coronavirus peak until the end of next year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research has predicted that the UK economy will shrink by 30% during the lockdown, and not return to the levels of Q4 2019 until the last quarter of 2021. Marketwatch has more details. Despite all the bad news this morning, Britain’s stock market has just hit its highest level in nearly seven weeks. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is rallying hard, up 94 points or 1.6% at 5941 points. That’s its highest level since Wednesday March 11 (the day before the index suffered its worst day since 1987). Retail group JD Sports is the top riser, up 8%, followed by Barclays (+7%) and exhibitions group Informa (+7%). European markets are higher too, with the Stoxx 600 now up 1.5% today. Italy’s FTSE MIB has gained 2.5%. Investors appear to be wagering that Covid-19 lockdown measures will ease soon, and that companies will recover from this year’s trauma. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, explains: “Further gains for the FTSE 100 look odd on a morning when major components like BP and HSBC report poor earnings, but for the most part the gainers in the index are those that will see an upturn in activity as lockdowns ease across most of the globe, if perhaps not yet in the UK. This continues the theme from yesterday’s session, when it seemed as if the whole world was looking to a post-coronavirus environment, when some semblance of normality may return.” These charts from the CBI’s ‘distributive trades’ survey show how retail sales slumped this month - both in stores (where open) and online. Newflash: UK retailers have suffered their joint-biggest ever fall in sales, after many were forced to shut their doors because of the pandemic. A survey conducted by the CBI, which represents UK businesses, found that 71% of retailers saw a drop in sales this month, compared to a year ago. Just 16% saw a rise. That gives a net balance of -55%, matching the previous low in December 2008 (after the financial crisis). The CBI says: Retailers reported a steep drop in sales in the year to April – matching the decline in December 2008, marking the joint sharpest fall since the survey began in July 1983. Two-thirds of retailers reported that the coronavirus is having a significantly negative impact on their domestic sales, with 39% saying they had shutdown completely. Some 44% have temporarily laid off staff, with 8% making permanent job cuts. Alarmingly, nearly all retailers (96%) reported cash flow difficulties (96%), with a third saying they were struggling to access external finance. And every sector of retail reported that sales in April were weaker than a year ago. The CBI says: Every sub-sector reported a negative balance in April, including grocers (balance of -27% from +94%) and specialist food &amp; drinks (-4% from +42%) which both reported strong growth in March. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, explains: “It’s no surprise that the lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell, suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit. “Although the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk, there are encouraging signs that the Government’s Job Retention Scheme is providing genuine relief, with many opting for temporary rather than permanent lay-offs. “Continued support for retailers to cover their fixed costs will be vital for ensuring that businesses are able to re-open when it’s safe and appropriate to do so.” The survey took place between 27 March and 15 April. Charts to follow.... A new report from Resolution Foundation shows that women, low-paid workers, younger employees and parents are being hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. They’ve calculated that women make up a majority of ‘key workers’, which means they run a greater risk of exposure to the virus as they’re not isolating. Those key workers are often relatively lowly paid. The economic impact of the virus isn’t being shared equitably either. If you’re badly paid, or a younger adult, you’re more likely to have lost your job or been furloughed. Resolution’s report says: Key workers are disproportionately likely to be female, with employed women more than twice as likely to be in this group as employed men. Parents are more likely to be key workers than non-parents, and mothers even more so; 39 per cent of working mothers were key workers before this crisis began, compared to just 27 per cent of the working population as a whole. Workers in shutdown sectors are the lowest paid across the workforce. Typical pay for workers in shutdown sectors is less than half that of those able to work from home – £348 a week compared to £707 a week. Those in shutdown sectors are younger – their average age of 39 is four years below the average age of those who can work from home. Differences are even more pronounced at the very bottom of the age distribution: nearly two in five of every 16-24-year old who works are in these sectors and for those born after 2000 this figure is over than three-fifths. Resolution make another point that may resonate with older millennials -- the people born in the early 1980s are the most likely to be parents of children under nine. So they may now be trying to juggle home work with home teaching. It should not be forgotten that this is the same cohort of adults who experienced the sharpest deterioration in cohort-on-cohort pay progress in the aftermath of the financial crisis. UBS has slashed its forecast for the eurozone economy this year, and now sees an even deeper recession. It now fears that euro area GDP will contract by 6.1% this year, compared with a previous forecast of a 4.5% decline. Italy and Spain will be hardest hit, predicts, given the scale of their lockdowns. UBS revised its forecasts down due to two factors: the latest economic surveys, such as the manufacturing and service sector PMIs, have been even more grim than feared The easing of Covid-19 lockdowns will be more gradual than thought, with economic restrictions will be largely lifted only by end-June. UBS adds: We believe the economic damage across European countries will vary according to (a) the length and strictness of the shutdown; (b) the relative exposure to the most affected (services) sectors; and (c) the size of the economic policy response. We continue to project the largest decline in real GDP in Italy (-7.7%, revised from -5.0%) followed by +4.4% in 2021 (previously +1.9%). We expect Spanish real GDP to decline by 6.9% this year (previously -4.0%) and rise by 4.7% in 2021 (up from 2.5%). We have cut our 2020 GDP projection for Germany to -6% (from -4.7%) and now forecast 4.5% for 2021 (previously 1.8%). We expect French GDP to decline by 6.3% this year (revised from -4.3%), then grow by 3.9% in 2021 (up from 1.9%). Outside of the Eurozone, we now expect UK GDP to contract by 5.6% in 2020 (-3.9% previously) before rebounding by 4.0% in 2021 (up from 1.5%). For Switzerland, we now project a 4.6% decline this year (down from -3%), followed by +3.9% (2.2% before) in 2021. A new global survey by Ipsos MORI has found that Britons are particularly reluctant for the Covid-19 lockdown to end before the virus is under control. Just 22% of people in the UK agreed with the suggestion that the economy and business should be reopened even if the coronavirus was not contained. That’s the lowest out of the 14 major countries surveyed. Some 70% of people opposed the idea - joint highest, along with Canada. Conversely, people in China and Russia were keenest to get back to normality even if the outbreak was still running. Yesterday, Boris Johnson said it was too early to start to lift the UK’s restrictions - this poll suggests the public are comfortable with that. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political research at Ipsos MORI says: “Our latest polling across 14 countries show that Britons are the most cautious when it comes to reopening the economy, being the least keen for businesses to reopen if the Coronavirus is not contained. Furthermore, seven in ten Britons say that they will be nervous about leaving the house after the lockdown eases. These suggest that the turnaround in the economy might not be quite so fast as hoped for.” BP’s CEO Bernard Looney has warned that the oil giant will start to cut jobs around the world by the end of the year, as it tries to become more competitive. The FT’s Anjli Raval has the details: Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has dug into BP’s latest results to show how the oil price slump has hurt its finances: “BP has stuck with its dividend despite the turmoil currently wracking oil markets. However that’s coming at significant cost. Net debt shot up some $6bn this quarter and the group’s upper gearing limit is rapidly disappearing into the rear-view mirror. Negative free cash flow means the balance sheet would be deteriorating even without the dividend, and with a sizeable expense related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill expected next quarter, things look set to get worse before they get better. Some drastic cuts to capital expenditure should help ease the pressure for now, and $32bn of liquidity gives the group some breathing space, but longer term the group needs higher oil prices or lower operating costs, and ideally both. Oil prices are outside the group’s control, and with demand for fuel at BP’s petrol stations down 50% and aviation fuel demand down 80% it’s anyone’s guess how long they will take to normalise. However, operating costs are something the group can influence. Unemployment in Spain rate has risen, in another sign of the economic pain in Europe The Spanish jobless rate rose to 14.41% in the first quarter of 2020, up from 13.78% in October-December. Spain introduced a national lockdown in mid-March, by which time tourism was already suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. The US crude oil price is continuing to slide today. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery is now changing hands at just $10.58 per barrel, down $2.2 today. That contract expires in around three weeks - meaning anyone holding it has to actually collect the oil then. That means we risk a repeat of last week’s turmoil, when the May crude contract turned negative as it neared the expiry point. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: We have become used to negative interest rates, but negative oil is hard to comprehend. Supply is exceeding demand to such an extent that storage tanks are full. Dumping is unacceptable and so those who own the excess had to pay others to take the nasty black stuff away from them. There will be casualties, but it is too early to tell at the moment whether these will number countries, oil companies, banks or specialist funds. Suffice to say that this could be the shape of things to come. Charlie Kronick, oil finance analyst for Greenpeace UK, isn’t impressed that BP is still paying shareholders a dividend. He argues that BP should be investing more to fight the climate emergency, not giving shareholders a payout: “Today as profits tumble BP is shaping the future of the company, but more importantly the future of the climate. BP and the rest of the oil industry are still running the sector like a pyramid scheme, betting that demand will bounce back from every downturn and high dividends will distract investors from the underlying weaknesses of the business. “By sticking with a business as usual dividend payout, BP is ignoring the severity of the multiple crises we now face. Given the company’s plunging profits, dividends are not mandatory and can’t take precedence over investment in clean renewable energy crucial to a more resilient climate and economy. Our society’s response to the COVID challenge has been to come together to help each other, but BP continues to prioritise pacifying shareholders over investing where it is really needed. Banking giant HSBC has also been hurt badly by Covid-19. HSBC reported a 48% plunge in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, as it was forced to put $3bn aside to cover bad debts caused by the pandemic. The bank warned this morning: “The outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months. The impact and duration of the Covid-19 crisis will likely lead to higher ECL [expected credit losses] and put pressure on revenue due to lower customer activity levels and reduced global interest rates.” UK high-street chain Marks &amp; Spencer is shoring up its finances, after being hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdown. M&amp;S has told the City that it probably won’t pay a dividend for the current financial year, which will save £210m. The company has also persuaded its banks to relax, or remove, some of the conditions on its £1.1bn credit facility. Plus, it has been approved to tap the UK Government’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) -- designed to give liquidity to large companies. This gives M&amp;S “significant undrawn credit available for the 18 months ahead”. The firm also warned that the coronavirus lockdown is hurting its business badly: We are planning for the Clothing &amp; Home business to be severely constrained during lockdown and highly uncertain trading conditions in a prolonged exit period. In the absence of a clear basis for forecasting, our scenario planning and stress tests are based on materially subdued trading for the balance of 2020 in Clothing &amp; Home. M&amp;S benefits from having a strong food business and the transition to Ocado supply is on track to proceed in September to form a multi-channel food operation. However, Food trading has been adversely affected by lockdown due to the closure of cafes and slowdown in travel and some city centre locations. Shares in BP have dropped 1.6% at the start of trading, down 5.1p to 308.7p. That’s despite relief that the firm is paying a dividend, and that its underlying profits were better than feared (although still down sharply, to $791m from $2.35bn a year ago). As you can see, BP’s headline loss was a whopping $4.4bn. But that’s partly because the value of the oil in its inventories has slumped. The ‘underlying RC’, or replacement cost, figure strips that out. Why is the underlying RC measure relevant? Because it allows BP to show how well, or badly, its operations performed - without a fluctuating oil price flattering or flattening its results. BP’s business is in two parts -- one arm finds crude oil and gets it out of the ground, while the other arm refines it for consumers. So a weak oil price is bad for its upstream business (its product is less valuable) but good for the downstream arm (its raw materials cost less). Of course, a situation of weak oil prices and weak consumer demand is bad for both wings of BP..... Some snap reaction to BP’s results: BP also warns that the coronavirus pandemic makes it very hard to forecast how the oil price will change: Looking forward, there remains an exceptional level of uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook for prices and product demand, particularly while many economies remain under lockdown. There is the risk of more sustained consequences depending on the efforts of governments and the public and private sectors to manage the health, economic and financial stability effects of the pandemic. Despite the slump in oil prices, and profits, BP is still paying a dividend for the last quarter. Investors will get 10.5 cents per share, a relief when so many other FTSE 100 companies have suspended their dividend. Just in: Oil giant BP has warned that it faces an unprecedented challenge, as it reports a slump in profits. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive officer, told shareholders that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped to create an exceptionally challenged commodity environment. BP’s latest financial results, just released, show that it made a loss of $4.365bn in the first quarter of this year, down from a profit of $2.9bn a year ago. On an underlying basis, BP’s replacement cost profit (a better way of measuring oil companies), plunged by two-thirds to $791m (more than the City expected). That shows the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Saudi-Russia oil price war which also drove prices down this year. Looney says: This extraordinary time for the world demands extraordinary responses. And thankfully we are seeing that just about everywhere we look around the world. Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before, but that is no excuse to turn inward. BP, like many other companies, is stepping up and extending a helping hand to those in need. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is crashing again, as weak demand leaves producers struggling to find anywhere to store crude. A barrel of US crude oil for delivery in June now costs you just $11.20 per barrel this morning, down from $12.78 yesterday -- and $60 back in January. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has sunk by 4% to $19.20 - back towards the 21-year lows struck last week. That’s dampening the mood in the markets today, after solid gains on Monday. The selloff is fuelling worries that US crude oil prices could fall below zero again, if suppliers become desperate to shift stocks. Traders are looking nervously at Cushing, Oklahoma -- the hub of America’s oil industry -- for signs that its tanks are full to the brim. As Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum yesterday: “The market is very concerned of a repeat of negative pricing as the Cushing storage and delivery hub saturates” The turbulence has already forced the world’s largest oil-backed exchange traded fund to start ditching all its short-term contracts for oil delivery next month. This move by United States Oil Fund (known as USO) is push the June oil price lower, creating more volatility. Kyle Rodda of IG explains: The US Oil Funds decision to dump its entire exposure to the front month WTI Futures contract prompted another sell-off in crude prices, and further concern about global energy demand and supply capacity. Oil’s woes are also driven by anxiety over the global recession. There’s less cheery optimism about a V-shaped recovery, with more economists accepting that growth is likely to resemble a U, a W, or even the dreaded L..... New US retail sales figures, US trade and consumer confidence, and Spanish jobless data due today will all help us see how the economy is faring.

  <p>Profit fell sharply too, from $2.94 per share a year ago to $1.60 per share -- below forecasts of $1.69.</p> 
  <p>Caterpillar is not providing any full-year 2020 guidance due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic.</p>

  <p><strong>Despite all the bad news this morning, Britain’s stock market has just hit its highest level in nearly seven weeks.</strong></p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">UK retailers suffer historic slide in sales</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>Newflash: UK retailers have suffered their joint-biggest ever fall in sales, after many were forced to shut their doors because of the pandemic.</strong></p> 
  <p>A survey conducted by the CBI, which represents UK businesses, found that 71% of retailers saw a drop in sales this month, compared to a year ago. Just 16% saw a rise. </p> 
  <p>That gives a net balance of -55%, matching the previous low in December 2008 (after the financial crisis).</p> 
  <p>The CBI says:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Retailers reported a steep drop in sales in the year to April – matching the decline in December 2008, marking the joint sharpest fall since the survey began in July 1983.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Two-thirds of retailers reported that the coronavirus is having a significantly negative impact on their domestic sales, with 39% saying they had shutdown completely. Some 44% have temporarily laid off staff, with 8% making permanent job cuts.<br></p> 
  <p>Alarmingly, nearly all retailers (96%) reported cash flow difficulties (96%), with a third saying they were struggling to access external finance.</p> 
  <p>And every sector of retail reported that sales in April were weaker than a year ago.</p> 
  <p>The CBI says:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Every sub-sector reported a negative balance in April, including grocers (balance of -27% from +94%) and specialist food &amp; drinks (-4% from +42%) which both reported strong growth in March. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Rain Newton-Smith</strong>, <strong>CBI </strong>Chief Economist, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“It’s no surprise that the lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell, suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit.</p> 
   <p>“Although the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk, there are encouraging signs that the Government’s Job Retention Scheme is providing genuine relief, with many opting for temporary rather than permanent lay-offs.</p> 
   <p>“Continued support for retailers to cover their fixed costs will be vital for ensuring that businesses are able to re-open when it’s safe and appropriate to do so.”</p> 
  </blockquote>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Women and low-paid workers bear brunt of the crisis</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>A new report from Resolution Foundation shows that women, low-paid workers, younger employees and parents are being hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.</strong></p> 
  <p>They’ve calculated that women make up a majority of ‘key workers’, which means they run a greater risk of exposure to the virus as they’re not isolating. Those key workers are often relatively lowly paid.</p> 
  <p>The economic impact of the virus isn’t being shared equitably either. If you’re badly paid, or a younger adult, you’re more likely to have lost your job or been furloughed.</p> 
  <p><a href=""https://t.co/uWmJ8i4htU"">Resolution’s report says</a>:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Key workers are disproportionately likely to be female, with employed women more than twice as likely to be in this group as employed men.<br><br></li> 
   <li>Parents are more likely to be key workers than non-parents, and mothers even more so; 39 per cent of working mothers were key workers before this crisis began, compared to just 27 per cent of the working population as a whole.<br><br></li> 
   <li>Workers in shutdown sectors are the lowest paid across the workforce. Typical pay for workers in shutdown sectors is less than half that of those able to work from home – £348 a week compared to £707 a week.<br><br></li> 
   <li>Those in shutdown sectors are younger – their average age of 39 is four years below the average age of those who can work from home. Differences are even more pronounced at the very bottom of the age distribution: nearly two in five of every 16-24-year old who works are in these sectors and for those born after 2000 this figure is over than three-fifths. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Resolution make another point that may resonate with older millennials -- the people born in the early 1980s are the most likely to be parents of children under nine. So they may now be trying to juggle home work with home teaching.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>It should not be forgotten that this is the same cohort of adults who experienced the sharpest deterioration in cohort-on-cohort pay progress in the aftermath of the financial crisis. </p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>UBS has slashed its forecast for the eurozone economy this year, and now sees an even deeper recession.</strong></p> 
  <p>It now fears that euro area GDP will contract by 6.1% this year, compared with a previous forecast of a 4.5% decline. Italy and Spain will be hardest hit, predicts, given the scale of their lockdowns.</p> 
  <p>UBS revised its forecasts down due to two factors:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>the latest economic surveys, such as the manufacturing and service sector PMIs, have been even more grim than feared<br><br></li> 
   <li>The easing of Covid-19 lockdowns will be more gradual than thought, with economic restrictions will be largely lifted only by end-June.</li>

  <p>UBS adds:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We believe the economic damage across European countries will vary according to (a) the length and strictness of the shutdown; (b) the relative exposure to the most affected (services) sectors; and (c) the size of the economic policy response.</p> 
   <p>We continue to project the largest decline in real GDP in <strong>Italy </strong>(-7.7%, revised from -5.0%) followed by +4.4% in 2021 (previously +1.9%). We expect <strong>Spanish </strong>real GDP to decline by 6.9% this year (previously -4.0%) and rise by 4.7% in 2021 (up from 2.5%). We have cut our 2020 GDP projection for <strong>Germany </strong>to -6% (from -4.7%) and now forecast 4.5% for 2021 (previously 1.8%). We expect <strong>French </strong>GDP to decline by 6.3% this year (revised from -4.3%), then grow by 3.9% in 2021 (up from 1.9%).</p> 
   <p>Outside of the Eurozone, we now expect <strong>UK </strong>GDP to contract by 5.6% in 2020 (-3.9% previously) before rebounding by 4.0% in 2021 (up from 1.5%). For <strong>Switzerland</strong>, we now project a 4.6% decline this year (down from -3%), followed by +3.9% (2.2% before) in 2021.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>A new global survey by Ipsos MORI has found that Britons are particularly reluctant for the Covid-19 lockdown to end before the virus is under control.</strong></p> 
  <p>Just 22% of people in the UK agreed with the suggestion that the economy and business should be reopened even if the coronavirus was not contained. That’s the lowest out of the 14 major countries surveyed.</p> 
  <p>Some 70% of people opposed the idea - joint highest, along with Canada.</p> 
  <p>Conversely, people in China and Russia were keenest to get back to normality even if the outbreak was still running.</p>

  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“Our latest polling across 14 countries show that Britons are the most cautious when it comes to reopening the economy, being the least keen for businesses to reopen if the Coronavirus is not contained.</p> 
   <p>Furthermore, seven in ten Britons say that they will be nervous about leaving the house after the lockdown eases. These suggest that the turnaround in the economy might not be quite so fast as hoped for.”</p>

  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“BP has stuck with its dividend despite the turmoil currently wracking oil markets. However that’s coming at significant cost.</p> 
   <p>Net debt shot up some $6bn this quarter and the group’s upper gearing limit is rapidly disappearing into the rear-view mirror. Negative free cash flow means the balance sheet would be deteriorating even without the dividend, and with a sizeable expense related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill expected next quarter, things look set to get worse before they get better.</p> 
   <p>Some drastic cuts to capital expenditure should help ease the pressure for now, and $32bn of liquidity gives the group some breathing space, but longer term the group needs higher oil prices or lower operating costs, and ideally both. Oil prices are outside the group’s control, and with demand for fuel at BP’s petrol stations down 50% and aviation fuel demand down 80% it’s anyone’s guess how long they will take to normalise. However, operating costs are something the group can influence.</p>

  <p><strong>The US crude oil price is continuing to slide today.</strong></p> 
  <p>A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery is now changing hands at just $10.58 per barrel, down $2.2 today. That contract expires in around three weeks - meaning anyone holding it has to actually collect the oil then.</p> 
  <p>That means we risk a repeat of last week’s turmoil, when the May crude contract turned negative as it neared the expiry point.</p> 
  <p><strong>David Miller</strong>, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We have become used to negative interest rates, but negative oil is hard to comprehend. Supply is exceeding demand to such an extent that storage tanks are full. Dumping is unacceptable and so those who own the excess had to pay others to take the nasty black stuff away from them.</p> 
   <p>There will be casualties, but it is too early to tell at the moment whether these will number countries, oil companies, banks or specialist funds. Suffice to say that this could be the shape of things to come. </p>

  <p>He argues that BP should be investing more to fight the climate emergency, not giving shareholders a payout:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>“Today as profits tumble BP is shaping the future of the company, but more importantly the future of the climate.</p> 
   <p> BP and the rest of the oil industry are still running the sector like a pyramid scheme, betting that demand will bounce back from every downturn and high dividends will distract investors from the underlying weaknesses of the business. </p> 
   <p>“By sticking with a business as usual dividend payout, BP is ignoring the severity of the multiple crises we now face. Given the company’s plunging profits, dividends are not mandatory and can’t take precedence over investment in clean renewable energy crucial to a more resilient climate and economy. Our society’s response to the COVID challenge has been to come together to help each other, but BP continues to prioritise pacifying shareholders over investing where it is really needed.</p>

  <p><strong>UK high-street chain Marks &amp; Spencer is shoring up its finances, after being hit hard by </strong><strong>the Covid-19 lockdown. </strong></p> 
  <p>M&amp;S has told the City that it probably won’t pay a dividend for the current financial year, which will save £210m.</p> 
  <p>The company has also persuaded its banks to relax, or remove, some of the conditions on its £1.1bn credit facility. Plus, it has been approved to tap <a href=""https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/march/the-covid-corporate-financing-facility"">the UK Government’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) -- designed to give liquidity to large companies</a>.</p> 
  <p>This gives M&amp;S “significant undrawn credit available for the 18 months ahead”.</p> 
  <p>The firm also warned that the coronavirus lockdown is hurting its business badly:<br></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We are planning for the Clothing &amp; Home business to be severely constrained during lockdown and highly uncertain trading conditions in a prolonged exit period. In the absence of a clear basis for forecasting, our scenario planning and stress tests are based on materially subdued trading for the balance of 2020 in Clothing &amp; Home.</p> 
   <p>M&amp;S benefits from having a strong food business and the transition to Ocado supply is on track to proceed in September to form a multi-channel food operation. However, Food trading has been adversely affected by lockdown due to the closure of cafes and slowdown in travel and some city centre locations.</p>

  <p>As you can see, BP’s headline loss was a whopping $4.4bn. But that’s partly because the value of the oil in its inventories has slumped. The ‘underlying RC’, or replacement cost, figure strips that out. </p> 
  <p><strong>Why is the underlying RC measure relevant? </strong>Because it allows BP to show how well, or badly, its operations performed - without a fluctuating oil price flattering or flattening its results. </p> 
  <p>BP’s business is in two parts -- one arm finds crude oil and gets it out of the ground, while the other arm refines it for consumers. So a weak oil price is bad for its upstream business (its product is less valuable) but good for the downstream arm (its raw materials cost less).</p> 
  <p><strong>Of course, a situation of weak oil prices and weak consumer demand is bad for both wings of BP.....</strong><br></p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>Just in: Oil giant BP has warned that it faces an unprecedented challenge, as it reports a slump in profits.</strong></p> 
  <p>Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive officer, told shareholders that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped to create an exceptionally challenged commodity environment.</p> 
  <p>BP’s latest financial results, just released, show that it made a loss of $4.365bn in the first quarter of this year, down from a profit of $2.9bn a year ago.</p> 
  <p>On an underlying basis, BP’s replacement cost profit (a better way of measuring oil companies), plunged by two-thirds to $791m (more than the City expected).</p> 
  <p>That shows the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Saudi-Russia oil price war which also drove prices down this year.</p> 
  <p>Looney says:<br></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>This extraordinary time for the world demands extraordinary responses. </p> 
   <p>And thankfully we are seeing that just about everywhere we look around the world. Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before, but that is no excuse to turn inward. BP, like many other companies, is stepping up and extending a helping hand to those in need. </p>

European stock markets have hit their highest levels in seven weeks, despite another torrent of bad economic data. Hopes that the Covid-19 lockdowns will soon ease have lifted shares again today, with Britain’s FTSE 100 gaining almost 2% and solid gains across Europe. The rally came despite a series of grim reports, that confirmed the world economy is entering a deep recession. US consumer confidence suffered a record plunge, hitting its lowest level in five years. Americans reported that their current economic situation has worsened dramatically this month, although they’re a little more optimistic about the future than a month ago UK retailers reported that sales had taken a dive in April, with even grocers saying turnover was lower than a year ago (after a surge in March). With lockdowns likely to be lifted gradually, UBS forecast that the eurozone recession would be even deeper than first thought. With energy demand weak, the oil price came under further pressure. The price of a barrel of US crude oil for June delivery is currently down 6.5% at $11.95 per barrel. Oil giant BP reported that its earnings plunged in the first three months of this year, due to low oil prices. It said Covid-19 was helping to create an unprecedented crisis for the energy industry. Banking group HSBC also shone a light on the economic cost of the crisis, by putting aside $3bn to cover bad loans - and warning the bill could reach $11bn. Goodnight. GW Earlier today, UK’s financial watchdog fired a warning shot at Britain’s banks not to pressure corporate clients to give them work in return for financial assistance in the crisis. The FCA suspects that some banks have been demanding to take part in lucrative jobs such as share sales, in return for agreeing to emergency loans. Pretty unprofessional if so! Europe’s investors have shaken off the latest weak economic data, pushing shares higher across the region. Trading has just ended, with Britain’s FTSE 100 up 111 points of 1.9% at 5958, a seven-week high. Lloyds Bank was the top performer today, gaining almost 9% (up to the giddy heights of 33p), followed by JD Sports (up 8.5%). Cruise operator Carnival gained 8%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index closed 1.5% higher, with all the major indices up. France’s CAC gained 1.3%, as prime minister Edouard Philippe outlined plans to ease its lockdown from May 11. Schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations, Philippe told parliament. However, restaurants and cafes will remain closed until at least early June and professional sports, including soccer, will not begin again until the autumn. Interestingly.... the rally on Wall Street is somewhat fizzling out. The Dow is now down 0.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has dropped by 1%. Perhaps investors are fretting that today’s slump in consumer confidence doesn’t bode terribly well for the economy this year. Especially as stocks have already rebounded strongly in recent weeks.... Here’s a neat chart showing the recent divergence between the US stock market and consumer confidence. We’ll find out in a month’s time whether they’ve converged again - either through a drop in stocks or a rise in confidence.... (or maybe both!) US economist David Rosenberg feels the plunge in US consumer confidence is rather at odds with the recent stock market rally. Economist Rupert Seggins feels Americans aren’t nearly anxious enough! There is one glimmer of hope in the US consumer confidence report -- Americans are a little less pessimistic than a month ago. The ‘future expectations’ index, which asks people how they feel about the next six months, actually improved to 93.8 from 86.8 in March. That suggests that the US public may be looking forward to lockdown rules being lifted soon. But it was more than cancelled out by the record slump in how people feel about the economy right now (the current conditions index, which plunged to 76.4 from 166.7). Stock markets have actually pushed higher since the US consumer confidence figures were released. The UK’s FTSE 100 index is now up 124 points or 2% at 5969 points, on track to close at its highest level in seven weeks. Roughly one in six Americans expect their income to decline over the next six months, today’s consumer confidence report shows. Oof! US consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in nearly six years, as the Covid-19 pandemic spooks Americans. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index has slumped to 86.9 for April, the lowest since June 2014. That’s down from 120 points in March -- a truly dramatic (but not unsurprising) slide. The Conference Board’s assessment of the current economic situation fell especially sharply - in response to the surge in jobless claims across America, and the widespread lockdowns of factories and offices. Wall Street has hit a near seven-week high at the start of trading, matching the move in London today. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 314 points, or 1.3%, to 24,448, its highest level since Wednesday 11th March (during the worst week of the 2020 crash). Investors seem to be increasingly optimistic that the lockdowns which have caused such economic pain in recent weeks will ease soon, with the massive central bank money-printing operations likely to support asset prices too. America’s trade deficit has widened, partly due to a collapse in sales of new cars and industrial equipment to overseas customers. The Commerce Department has reported that the gap between the goods bought and sold by the US expanded by 7.2% last month to $64.2bn. Although Americans did buy less from abroad, that was more than countered by a drop in exports. Reuters has the details: In March, goods imports dropped 2.4% to $191.9 billion after decreasing 2.5% in February. There were sharp decreases in imports of consumer goods and motor vehicles and parts. Imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods rose last month. Exports of goods tumbled 6.7% to $127.6 billion in March. There was a broad decline in exports last month, with shipments of industrial supplies dropping 7.5% and motor vehicles and parts plummeting 17.8%. The volume of cargo being transported around the world by air tumbled by 15% in March, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), less than during the global financial crisis in 2008 when volumes fell by 23%. Airlines suffering a 30% decline in passenger travel are quickly trying to repurpose passenger aircraft, or bring freight airplanes out of storage in order to fly goods including medical supplies and pharmaceuticals around the world, according to the industry body. However IATA expects the volume of cargo flown around the world to fall during 2020 as the expected recession reduces consumers’ demand for goods. Sales at mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Caterpillar has reported that sales slumped by 21% in the first three months of 2020, as the global economy seized up. Revenues fell to $10.6bn, down from $13.5bn, due to “lower end user demand” Profit fell sharply too, from $2.94 per share a year ago to $1.60 per share -- below forecasts of $1.69. Caterpillar is not providing any full-year 2020 guidance due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Here’s our news story on April’s retail sales figures: The recent recovery in stock markets came after central banks and governments launched huge new rescue packages to help businesses and individuals survive the lockdown. This video explainer runs through the various schemes, and explains the risks.... More gloom: The U.K. economy isn’t expected to return to its pre-coronavirus peak until the end of next year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research has predicted that the UK economy will shrink by 30% during the lockdown, and not return to the levels of Q4 2019 until the last quarter of 2021. Marketwatch has more details. Despite all the bad news this morning, Britain’s stock market has just hit its highest level in nearly seven weeks. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is rallying hard, up 94 points or 1.6% at 5941 points. That’s its highest level since Wednesday March 11 (the day before the index suffered its worst day since 1987). Retail group JD Sports is the top riser, up 8%, followed by Barclays (+7%) and exhibitions group Informa (+7%). European markets are higher too, with the Stoxx 600 now up 1.5% today. Italy’s FTSE MIB has gained 2.5%. Investors appear to be wagering that Covid-19 lockdown measures will ease soon, and that companies will recover from this year’s trauma. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, explains: “Further gains for the FTSE 100 look odd on a morning when major components like BP and HSBC report poor earnings, but for the most part the gainers in the index are those that will see an upturn in activity as lockdowns ease across most of the globe, if perhaps not yet in the UK. This continues the theme from yesterday’s session, when it seemed as if the whole world was looking to a post-coronavirus environment, when some semblance of normality may return.” These charts from the CBI’s ‘distributive trades’ survey show how retail sales slumped this month - both in stores (where open) and online. Newflash: UK retailers have suffered their joint-biggest ever fall in sales, after many were forced to shut their doors because of the pandemic. A survey conducted by the CBI, which represents UK businesses, found that 71% of retailers saw a drop in sales this month, compared to a year ago. Just 16% saw a rise. That gives a net balance of -55%, matching the previous low in December 2008 (after the financial crisis). The CBI says: Retailers reported a steep drop in sales in the year to April – matching the decline in December 2008, marking the joint sharpest fall since the survey began in July 1983. Two-thirds of retailers reported that the coronavirus is having a significantly negative impact on their domestic sales, with 39% saying they had shutdown completely. Some 44% have temporarily laid off staff, with 8% making permanent job cuts. Alarmingly, nearly all retailers (96%) reported cash flow difficulties (96%), with a third saying they were struggling to access external finance. And every sector of retail reported that sales in April were weaker than a year ago. The CBI says: Every sub-sector reported a negative balance in April, including grocers (balance of -27% from +94%) and specialist food &amp; drinks (-4% from +42%) which both reported strong growth in March. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, explains: “It’s no surprise that the lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two fifths have shut up shop completely for now. And sales of groceries and other essentials also fell, suggesting households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit. “Although the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees in retail remain at risk, there are encouraging signs that the Government’s Job Retention Scheme is providing genuine relief, with many opting for temporary rather than permanent lay-offs. “Continued support for retailers to cover their fixed costs will be vital for ensuring that businesses are able to re-open when it’s safe and appropriate to do so.” The survey took place between 27 March and 15 April. Charts to follow.... A new report from Resolution Foundation shows that women, low-paid workers, younger employees and parents are being hit particularly hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. They’ve calculated that women make up a majority of ‘key workers’, which means they run a greater risk of exposure to the virus as they’re not isolating. Those key workers are often relatively lowly paid. The economic impact of the virus isn’t being shared equitably either. If you’re badly paid, or a younger adult, you’re more likely to have lost your job or been furloughed. Resolution’s report says: Key workers are disproportionately likely to be female, with employed women more than twice as likely to be in this group as employed men. Parents are more likely to be key workers than non-parents, and mothers even more so; 39 per cent of working mothers were key workers before this crisis began, compared to just 27 per cent of the working population as a whole. Workers in shutdown sectors are the lowest paid across the workforce. Typical pay for workers in shutdown sectors is less than half that of those able to work from home – £348 a week compared to £707 a week. Those in shutdown sectors are younger – their average age of 39 is four years below the average age of those who can work from home. Differences are even more pronounced at the very bottom of the age distribution: nearly two in five of every 16-24-year old who works are in these sectors and for those born after 2000 this figure is over than three-fifths. Resolution make another point that may resonate with older millennials -- the people born in the early 1980s are the most likely to be parents of children under nine. So they may now be trying to juggle home work with home teaching. It should not be forgotten that this is the same cohort of adults who experienced the sharpest deterioration in cohort-on-cohort pay progress in the aftermath of the financial crisis. UBS has slashed its forecast for the eurozone economy this year, and now sees an even deeper recession. It now fears that euro area GDP will contract by 6.1% this year, compared with a previous forecast of a 4.5% decline. Italy and Spain will be hardest hit, predicts, given the scale of their lockdowns. UBS revised its forecasts down due to two factors: the latest economic surveys, such as the manufacturing and service sector PMIs, have been even more grim than feared The easing of Covid-19 lockdowns will be more gradual than thought, with economic restrictions will be largely lifted only by end-June. UBS adds: We believe the economic damage across European countries will vary according to (a) the length and strictness of the shutdown; (b) the relative exposure to the most affected (services) sectors; and (c) the size of the economic policy response. We continue to project the largest decline in real GDP in Italy (-7.7%, revised from -5.0%) followed by +4.4% in 2021 (previously +1.9%). We expect Spanish real GDP to decline by 6.9% this year (previously -4.0%) and rise by 4.7% in 2021 (up from 2.5%). We have cut our 2020 GDP projection for Germany to -6% (from -4.7%) and now forecast 4.5% for 2021 (previously 1.8%). We expect French GDP to decline by 6.3% this year (revised from -4.3%), then grow by 3.9% in 2021 (up from 1.9%). Outside of the Eurozone, we now expect UK GDP to contract by 5.6% in 2020 (-3.9% previously) before rebounding by 4.0% in 2021 (up from 1.5%). For Switzerland, we now project a 4.6% decline this year (down from -3%), followed by +3.9% (2.2% before) in 2021. A new global survey by Ipsos MORI has found that Britons are particularly reluctant for the Covid-19 lockdown to end before the virus is under control. Just 22% of people in the UK agreed with the suggestion that the economy and business should be reopened even if the coronavirus was not contained. That’s the lowest out of the 14 major countries surveyed. Some 70% of people opposed the idea - joint highest, along with Canada. Conversely, people in China and Russia were keenest to get back to normality even if the outbreak was still running. Yesterday, Boris Johnson said it was too early to start to lift the UK’s restrictions - this poll suggests the public are comfortable with that. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political research at Ipsos MORI says: “Our latest polling across 14 countries show that Britons are the most cautious when it comes to reopening the economy, being the least keen for businesses to reopen if the Coronavirus is not contained. Furthermore, seven in ten Britons say that they will be nervous about leaving the house after the lockdown eases. These suggest that the turnaround in the economy might not be quite so fast as hoped for.” BP’s CEO Bernard Looney has warned that the oil giant will start to cut jobs around the world by the end of the year, as it tries to become more competitive. The FT’s Anjli Raval has the details: Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has dug into BP’s latest results to show how the oil price slump has hurt its finances: “BP has stuck with its dividend despite the turmoil currently wracking oil markets. However that’s coming at significant cost. Net debt shot up some $6bn this quarter and the group’s upper gearing limit is rapidly disappearing into the rear-view mirror. Negative free cash flow means the balance sheet would be deteriorating even without the dividend, and with a sizeable expense related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill expected next quarter, things look set to get worse before they get better. Some drastic cuts to capital expenditure should help ease the pressure for now, and $32bn of liquidity gives the group some breathing space, but longer term the group needs higher oil prices or lower operating costs, and ideally both. Oil prices are outside the group’s control, and with demand for fuel at BP’s petrol stations down 50% and aviation fuel demand down 80% it’s anyone’s guess how long they will take to normalise. However, operating costs are something the group can influence. Unemployment in Spain rate has risen, in another sign of the economic pain in Europe The Spanish jobless rate rose to 14.41% in the first quarter of 2020, up from 13.78% in October-December. Spain introduced a national lockdown in mid-March, by which time tourism was already suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic. The US crude oil price is continuing to slide today. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery is now changing hands at just $10.58 per barrel, down $2.2 today. That contract expires in around three weeks - meaning anyone holding it has to actually collect the oil then. That means we risk a repeat of last week’s turmoil, when the May crude contract turned negative as it neared the expiry point. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: We have become used to negative interest rates, but negative oil is hard to comprehend. Supply is exceeding demand to such an extent that storage tanks are full. Dumping is unacceptable and so those who own the excess had to pay others to take the nasty black stuff away from them. There will be casualties, but it is too early to tell at the moment whether these will number countries, oil companies, banks or specialist funds. Suffice to say that this could be the shape of things to come. Charlie Kronick, oil finance analyst for Greenpeace UK, isn’t impressed that BP is still paying shareholders a dividend. He argues that BP should be investing more to fight the climate emergency, not giving shareholders a payout: “Today as profits tumble BP is shaping the future of the company, but more importantly the future of the climate. BP and the rest of the oil industry are still running the sector like a pyramid scheme, betting that demand will bounce back from every downturn and high dividends will distract investors from the underlying weaknesses of the business. “By sticking with a business as usual dividend payout, BP is ignoring the severity of the multiple crises we now face. Given the company’s plunging profits, dividends are not mandatory and can’t take precedence over investment in clean renewable energy crucial to a more resilient climate and economy. Our society’s response to the COVID challenge has been to come together to help each other, but BP continues to prioritise pacifying shareholders over investing where it is really needed. Banking giant HSBC has also been hurt badly by Covid-19. HSBC reported a 48% plunge in pre-tax profits in the last quarter, as it was forced to put $3bn aside to cover bad debts caused by the pandemic. The bank warned this morning: “The outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months. The impact and duration of the Covid-19 crisis will likely lead to higher ECL [expected credit losses] and put pressure on revenue due to lower customer activity levels and reduced global interest rates.” UK high-street chain Marks &amp; Spencer is shoring up its finances, after being hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdown. M&amp;S has told the City that it probably won’t pay a dividend for the current financial year, which will save £210m. The company has also persuaded its banks to relax, or remove, some of the conditions on its £1.1bn credit facility. Plus, it has been approved to tap the UK Government’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) -- designed to give liquidity to large companies. This gives M&amp;S “significant undrawn credit available for the 18 months ahead”. The firm also warned that the coronavirus lockdown is hurting its business badly: We are planning for the Clothing &amp; Home business to be severely constrained during lockdown and highly uncertain trading conditions in a prolonged exit period. In the absence of a clear basis for forecasting, our scenario planning and stress tests are based on materially subdued trading for the balance of 2020 in Clothing &amp; Home. M&amp;S benefits from having a strong food business and the transition to Ocado supply is on track to proceed in September to form a multi-channel food operation. However, Food trading has been adversely affected by lockdown due to the closure of cafes and slowdown in travel and some city centre locations. Shares in BP have dropped 1.6% at the start of trading, down 5.1p to 308.7p. That’s despite relief that the firm is paying a dividend, and that its underlying profits were better than feared (although still down sharply, to $791m from $2.35bn a year ago). As you can see, BP’s headline loss was a whopping $4.4bn. But that’s partly because the value of the oil in its inventories has slumped. The ‘underlying RC’, or replacement cost, figure strips that out. Why is the underlying RC measure relevant? Because it allows BP to show how well, or badly, its operations performed - without a fluctuating oil price flattering or flattening its results. BP’s business is in two parts -- one arm finds crude oil and gets it out of the ground, while the other arm refines it for consumers. So a weak oil price is bad for its upstream business (its product is less valuable) but good for the downstream arm (its raw materials cost less). Of course, a situation of weak oil prices and weak consumer demand is bad for both wings of BP..... Some snap reaction to BP’s results: BP also warns that the coronavirus pandemic makes it very hard to forecast how the oil price will change: Looking forward, there remains an exceptional level of uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook for prices and product demand, particularly while many economies remain under lockdown. There is the risk of more sustained consequences depending on the efforts of governments and the public and private sectors to manage the health, economic and financial stability effects of the pandemic. Despite the slump in oil prices, and profits, BP is still paying a dividend for the last quarter. Investors will get 10.5 cents per share, a relief when so many other FTSE 100 companies have suspended their dividend. Just in: Oil giant BP has warned that it faces an unprecedented challenge, as it reports a slump in profits. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive officer, told shareholders that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped to create an exceptionally challenged commodity environment. BP’s latest financial results, just released, show that it made a loss of $4.365bn in the first quarter of this year, down from a profit of $2.9bn a year ago. On an underlying basis, BP’s replacement cost profit (a better way of measuring oil companies), plunged by two-thirds to $791m (more than the City expected). That shows the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Saudi-Russia oil price war which also drove prices down this year. Looney says: This extraordinary time for the world demands extraordinary responses. And thankfully we are seeing that just about everywhere we look around the world. Our industry has been hit by supply and demand shocks on a scale never seen before, but that is no excuse to turn inward. BP, like many other companies, is stepping up and extending a helping hand to those in need. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is crashing again, as weak demand leaves producers struggling to find anywhere to store crude. A barrel of US crude oil for delivery in June now costs you just $11.20 per barrel this morning, down from $12.78 yesterday -- and $60 back in January. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has sunk by 4% to $19.20 - back towards the 21-year lows struck last week. That’s dampening the mood in the markets today, after solid gains on Monday. The selloff is fuelling worries that US crude oil prices could fall below zero again, if suppliers become desperate to shift stocks. Traders are looking nervously at Cushing, Oklahoma -- the hub of America’s oil industry -- for signs that its tanks are full to the brim. As Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum yesterday: “The market is very concerned of a repeat of negative pricing as the Cushing storage and delivery hub saturates” The turbulence has already forced the world’s largest oil-backed exchange traded fund to start ditching all its short-term contracts for oil delivery next month. This move by United States Oil Fund (known as USO) is push the June oil price lower, creating more volatility. Kyle Rodda of IG explains: The US Oil Funds decision to dump its entire exposure to the front month WTI Futures contract prompted another sell-off in crude prices, and further concern about global energy demand and supply capacity. Oil’s woes are also driven by anxiety over the global recession. There’s less cheery optimism about a V-shaped recovery, with more economists accepting that growth is likely to resemble a U, a W, or even the dreaded L..... New US retail sales figures, US trade and consumer confidence, and Spanish jobless data due today will all help us see how the economy is faring.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization"">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley""><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-hopson"">Chris Hopson</a>, its chief executive, added that the 100,000 target may have a “galvanising effect” but “what matters most is an updated strategy to take us through the exit from lockdown”.</p> \n<p>He added: “Trusts stand ready to play their part in delivering that new testing regime, but they need to know a lot more, as quickly as possible, to play that part effectively.</p> \n<p>“The NHS has achieved so much in confronting the challenges posed by coronavirus.

<p>“At the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups with no visibility on any longer term strategy, and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.”</p>

    <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again"">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014/15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>
    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>
    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>
    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>
    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization"">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.</p>

<p>He added: “Trusts stand ready to play their part in delivering that new testing regime, but they need to know a lot more, as quickly as possible, to play that part effectively.</p>

<p>Further criticism came from Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, who said the goal had been set and driven forward without local consultation. Burnham, a health secretary in Gordon Brown’s government, said the drive to hit the target had been done in a “haphazard way” without local consultation.</p> 
<p>At a meeting of the region’s Covid-19 emergency committee on Wednesday, he welcomed the increase in testing capacity but warned a more strategic and co-ordinated approach was needed.</p> 
<p>“Lots of frustration [was] expressed at the meeting about arrangements for testing and what feels to people to be a confused picture across Greater Manchester with different capacity and overlapping schemes, and still capacity being put in without any reference to local authorities,” he told a press conference.</p> 
<p>“It feels to us as though the government has been chasing the target on testing without fully thinking through the strategy at a local level and involving local leaders.”</p>

<p>With just one day to go, there was evidence of a significant push to increase the numbers and hit the goal.</p> 
<p>Hancock urged a wider range of people to apply for tests in an email sent out from Conservative central office. The over-65s or anyone who has to go out to work – or their families – <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested"">could apply online for a test</a> if they had symptoms. “This means construction workers to emergency plumbers, research scientists to those in manufacturing – can now be tested,” he said.</p>

<p>A Guardian analysis of the data suggests that around 20% more tests are carried out each day than there are people tested. On Tuesday, that rose to a high of 37%.

NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, rounded on ministers for “a series of frequent tactical announcements” to expand testing criteria, and dismissed the 100,000 target as a “red herring” that distracted from their failures. Just 33,000 people were tested for Covid-19 in the latest 24-hour period – a record high for a single day – according to official figures. Dominic Raab, the first secretary of state, said that more than 52,000 tests were carried out, but this total is apparently bolstered by 19,000 retests. Test capacity was now more than 73,000 a day, he said – still considerably below the target set by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, at the start of April. Comprehensive testing – combined with tracing those who have come into contact with sufferers, and containing the spread through careful self-isolation – has been described as the route out of lockdown while avoiding a serious second peak. On Wednesday ministers confirmed that total UK coronavirus deaths had exceeded 26,000.

The ship docked at the LNG terminal in Fos Cavaou, southern France, as planned, but by then the world was in coronavirus lockdown. He couldn’t disembark, and international flights were grounded, preventing him from getting home to Newcastle, UK. So the 27-year-old former Royal Navy warfare officer has been stuck onboard as the ship criss-crosses the ocean from Qatar to Turkey and France and back. The 34-man crew, from the Philippines, India, Russia and Ireland, have had their pay increased by 50%, but they just want to go home. “We are still loading, sailing and discharging our cargo. But in the back of our minds, we are starting to realise: we are trapped. People are essentially prisoners,” he said. “There is no way to get off the ship.” Stapley-Bunten is one of 150,000 seafarers stranded at sea on their vessels, forced to work beyond their contracts indefinitely, often seven days a week. Many have families and don’t know when they will see them again. They have been given no choice but to keep going, from port to port, unloading at docks that are open for cargo but closed to the seafarers who deliver it. Cargo ships are responsible for delivering as much as 90% per cent of the global trade in goods, and the world’s 1.2 million seafarers are a resilient workforce, operating in often dangerous conditions, seven days a week. Britain, Spain and the Netherlands have designated them key workers during the health crisis. But they are being stretched to the limit: working beyond their contracts, exhausted, under stress, and invisible to the governments that rely on the goods they carry. The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) has received multiple reports of crew members with life-threatening conditions who have been refused emergency treatment at ports, despite the illnesses being unrelated to Covid-19. Unions and shipping and maritime organisations warn of a health and safety crisis. They are lobbying governments to lift restrictions to allow crew members home, but so far with little success. Many governments are making huge efforts to ensure cargo continues to be delivered safely. But there is no similar effort to help seafarers. The European commission has issued guidelines to facilitate the safe movement of seafarers and shipping companies, suggesting key ports – including Singapore, Rotterdam, Gibraltar and Hong Kong – where crew changes could take place safely. But unions have said port states and governments are not responding. “Governments are managing to get their citizens home from abroad, passengers from cruise liners, yet there are 150,000 seafarers still out there, working to keep global supply chains open, who can’t get home,” Mark Dickinson, general secretary for Nautilus International, the maritime union, said. “The EU, the International Transport Workers’ Federation, the International Labour Organization, are saying please get these seafarers home, but individual governments are not pulling their weight. It is becoming a health and safety crisis and it’s getting worse by the day.” Kees Wiersum, captain of a Dutch-flagged specialised cargo ship currently sailing off the coast of Madagascar, said he is concerned about “fatigue and depression” among his 21-man, mainly Filipino, crew. “They are in contact with their families, but if something happens, they can’t do anything,” said Wiersum. “We are trying to keep their spirits up, but they will tell you their families need them home. Some of them are expecting babies and they can’t get home for the births.” Even if they were repatriated to the Philippines, one of the largest suppliers of seafarers in the world, they would face the additional obstacle of overcrowded quarantine facilities in Manila. “Our minister of transport calls us heroes. He said we are vital for the economy,” said Wiersum, 61, a Dutchman who has spent 43 years at sea. “But we are treated like pariahs, like criminals. We can’t go ashore for a walk or a beer, or even for medical help. In Holland, they have repatriated holidaymakers all over the world. But they forgot about us.” One of the most pressing problems is that seafarers are not being afforded the usual rights to get medical treatment at ports. Fabrizio Barcellona, from the seafarer section of the ITF, said he was receiving 10–15 reports of medical emergencies a day, and those are “just the ones we know about”.

If the 150,000 seafarers estimated to be working beyond their contracts are not relieved of their duties in two weeks, they will be in breach of maritime regulations. Several groups – including the ITF, International Chamber of Shipping and the International Air Transport Association – have proposed a 12-step protocol to allow seafarers to join or leave ships at a series of “repatriation hubs”, from where they could fly home. Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF, said: “Our message for governments is clear: you cannot continue with a mentality of out of sight, out of mind, and we strongly urge governments to act now before we suffer more serious human or environmental consequences.” Guy Platten, general secretary of the International Chamber of Shipping, described the plight of seafarers as a “ticking timebomb”. “We could start to see disruption to trade, and more importantly we risk accidents and mental health issues.

President Emmanuel Macron, his face digitally aged by a decade, informs the nation: “Compatriots, you may now go out.” A spoof tourist guidebook promises “the indispensable guide to the finest undiscovered corners of your place of residence”. Videos of neighbours cycling round the balcony and flatmates playing foot-ping have gone viral while on Twitter individuals share their tales of lockdown woe: “My mother: ‘You don’t get fed up spending the whole day on your computer?’ Me: ‘I run a web marketing department.’ Mother: ‘So?’” tweeted one. Another lamented that after only four days of confinement, his mother could take no more: “She told me to go out – and she’d pay the fine.” Reporting by Angela Giuffrida, Kate Connolly, Kim Willsher,

<p>As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained – and to counter what the continent’s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement.</p> 
<p>Like everyone else, Italy’s 60 million citizens, who went into lockdown on 9 March, have been “asked to make sacrifices”, said Sara Raginelli, a psychologist in Ancona. “And as we live in a rather dramatic way, our mental health is being challenged.”</p> 
<p>In a survey during the first week of Italy’s confinement, 93% of respondents said they felt at least a little anxious, while 42% described a distinct drop in their mood and 28% reported that they were not sleeping well.</p> 
<p>Italians are entitled to a free online consultation from the health ministry, which has warned of a “psychological emergency”, saying people risk being “overwhelmed by fear of a insidious virus that has banned us from hugging and being close to others”.</p>

<p>Some 9,000 psychologists are involved in the #psicologionline scheme, offering phone or video consultations aimed also at countering the “heartbreaking effects of the daily death toll, warlike scenes, and easy risk of infection if we don’t stay home”.</p> 
<p>Some degree of anxiety, of course, is only normal. Borwin Bandelow, from Göttingen in Germany, said humans developed into social creatures to survive, so isolation was an unnatural state for most. “In the past we lived in tribes, and those who broke away from those tribes had very little chance,” he told Der Spiegel<em>.</em></p>

 </blockquote> 
</aside> 
<p>That meant isolation “can cause some to develop pathological angst conditions,” he said. But overall, the long-term negative effects of physical isolation should be considerably lessened by the knowledge that everyone is experiencing them, said Bandelow, who has made a special study of fear.</p> 
<p>“As soon as an exceptional situation affects many people, the effect is less strong … During the war in Yugoslavia, patients who habitually suffered panic attacks were no more scared than the next person. In fact, the number of panic attacks decreased, because they were suddenly faced with other, very concrete things they had to fear. They needed to protect themselves, and so needed to have control over their bodies.”</p> 
<p>Germans who suffer from angst or panic at an avalanche of coronavirus news can turn to a fear-free news service, <a href=""https://www.angstselbsthilfe.de/angstfrei-news/"">angstfrei.news</a>, which twice a day publishes a short news overview so that they can stay informed without being overwhelmed by horror stories.</p> 
<p>French psychologists echo the importance of realising that the pain is shared. While everyone will respond differently, we all “have to be able to make sense of the situation”, said Aurélia Schneider. “This will give us psychological protection. It’s about knowing this isn’t an individual and isolated suffering, but a collective suffering.”</p> 
<p>In Spain, however, clinical psychologist Albert Soler warned against the dangers of trying to stay falsely upbeat. “When things are bad, being pressured to be positive can be positively harmful,” he said. “The positivism of Instagram is dangerous at the best of times – but now it’s even worse.”</p> 
<p>In terms of practical advice, Europe’s psychologists mainly stress the importance of staying in touch and keeping busy, if necessary with the help of daily to-do lists. In Italy, Raginelli’s advice was to “maintain contact with others” by every means possible and as much as possible.</p>

<p>Rosella De Leonibus, a psychologist in Perugia, said that keeping active was vitally important. What counted, she said, was “everything that’s an action – with a result. Passive is no use; passivity makes you feel anxious and increases anxiety.”</p> 
<p>Erik Scherder, a professor of neuropsychology at VU university in Amsterdam, said the crisis presented a challenge and an opportunity: to exercise. “The biggest gains are for those who are very sedentary,” he told <a href=""https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200325_04902478?articlehash=BBF42F032202527A5A91C5C7F971CA3CDFB577E5C595515F5E0B95A375A4C8A29CCB7C5F2185D09574B4BFEA6E807A8730F6683E20C5BAE341DAA79A5EDE35B4"">De Standaard.</a> “Which is most of us.”</p> 
<p>Belgians, who <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/18/belgium-enters-lockdown-over-coronavirus-crisis-in-pictures"">went into confinement</a> on 17 March, are getting regular down-to-earth suggestions on how to live their best locked-down lives by the spokesman at the national crisis centre, Benoît Ramacker, who advises basic everyday activities such as cooking, reading, gardening and DIY.</p> 
<p>“The psycho-social dimension is very important in this crisis,” Ramacker said at one briefing, urging people not to spend the whole day on social media and to establish a routine that gives structure to their days. “You can do a lot at home.”</p> 
<p>But there are bound to be tensions. When the inevitable rows do break out, Jean-Luc Aubert from Nantes suggests self-isolating for a while in the bathroom. “Everyone is a little anxious, so it doesn’t take much for everyone to get upset, angry, worse,” he said. “We have to acknowledge this, to be very careful and on our guard.”</p> 
<p>Whether they have listened to the psychologists or not, millions across the continent have developed coping strategies. Gregarious by nature and used to living life outdoors, Spaniards – most of whom, like many Europeans, live in apartments – are finding solitude, silence and confinement particularly hard.</p> 
<p>Rooftop terraces have become a popular location for workouts, although not everyone has access. Many have taken to running up and down the communal staircase. One father reported that his daughter was keeping up volleyball practice at home, using a toilet roll as a ball so as to avoid breakages.</p> 
<p>Many, too, have been faced with the delicate challenge of educating elderly relatives they would habitually visit at least once a week in the use of mobile technology. “I’ve taught my 82-year-old mother how to make video calls,” said Reme, one Barcelona resident. “Now there’s no stopping her.”</p> 
<p>Italians, also suffering from having to lead an indoor life, cheered the world in the early stages of their confinement by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown"">singing or playing musical instruments from their balconies</a> each night in a show of solidarity, although reports suggest that has tapered off over the past week.</p> 
<p>Many have now taken to doing online yoga or are sharing their fitness regimes. Others have been writing, painting, and cooking more – and sharing their recipes online. Many are joining top chef Massimo Bottura for his live <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/massimobottura/?hl=en"">Instagram show</a>.</p> 
<p>“It’s not a masterclass, it’s kitchen quarantine with our family,” Bottura said. “We just want to have fun and show to the world that with a few things – a table, a few ingredients, a family – we can have fun.”</p> 
<p>Simona Fabrizio, another international chef and the owner of Sagraincasa in Orvieto, Umbria, asks her followers to pick one ingredient – eggs, tuna, chicken – and create a recipe with an additional four ingredients, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B-AReoGJwzp/?igshid=1c0n9j1efa8ad"">then share their pictures</a>.</p> 
<p>In Germany, <a href=""https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/wie-42-000-freizeithacker-das-virus-bekaempfen-a-b9ba7f2e-0a11-4a4c-a958-d20ac9600823"">42,000 programmers and software designers gathered online</a> for a mass hackathon. #Wirvsvirus (we against the virus) came up with possible solutions to problems including virus tracking, improving inter-hospital communication, distributing food to the homeless, and helping farmers find people to bring in the harvest, and ended with a mass party on YouTube and Slack.

One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day.</p> <p>But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time.</p> <p>For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=""https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/"" title="""">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=""https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera"" title="""">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.”</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera’s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm"" title="""">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg"" alt=""A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001."" width=""1000"" height=""656"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called <a href=""https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/34622/"" title="""">Isabella Hazard</a>. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the panic created by the “Blue Death”, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory – that the disease was associated with “bad airs” (or “miasmas”) – inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets “to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys”.</p> <p>So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics"" title="""">millions</a> of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary <a href=""https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133436/7/133436.pdf"" title="""">Mario Adorno</a> accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting “a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people” of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.</p> <p>But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive – they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg"" title="""">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=""https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854"" title="""">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg"" alt=""A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow’s revelations led to the creation of “Improvement Trusts” and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=""https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/"" title="""">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=""http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/"" title="""">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn’t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=""http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf"" title="""">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “<em>vibrios</em>” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=""https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/"" title="""">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De"" title="""">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg"" alt=""A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=""https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf"" title="""">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=""https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c"" title="""">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html"" title="""">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext"" title="""">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=""https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7"" title="""">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic"" title="""">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=""https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/"" title="""">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/"" title="""">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/"" title="""">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=""https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1"" title="""">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/"" title="""">47 countries</a> – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=""https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211"" title="""">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1"" title="""">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=""https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose"" title="""">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts"" title="""">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=""https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever"" title="""">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=""https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/"" title="""">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik"" title="""">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/"" title="""">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg"" alt=""An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called “10/90 gap”, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world’s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=""https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/"" title="""">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus"" title="""">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=""https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls"" title="""">has written</a> that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html"" title="""">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=""https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort"" title="""">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/"" title="""">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '5', 'wordcount': '4337', 'displayHint': 'immersive', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-05-01T05:00:15Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-05-04T17:01:47Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-05-01T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dmqtv', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/056e89f4217902ea1a711b2cd9b480d4e6ef1bd0/0_80_6220_3732/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'We log in every day at 7.45am. One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day. But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time. For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. * * * To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents. The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.” In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices. Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours. For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera’s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which originated in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it. Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half. In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s. In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly. It is hard to imagine the panic created by the “Blue Death”, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory – that the disease was associated with “bad airs” (or “miasmas”) – inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets “to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys”. So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting “a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people” of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them. But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive – they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy. * * * In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks. When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water. This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow’s revelations led to the creation of “Improvement Trusts” and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but only 1% of Indians outside the colonial walls. Today, more than half of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn’t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people. * * * John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick. In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool. Pacini studied the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue. Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “vibrios” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades. Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today. Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease. These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin. Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days. There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India. There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera. So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK. Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth. * * * In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution. This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892. According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west. * * * A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart. The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets. At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001. On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case. What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people. It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera. * * * There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions. The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world. There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks. It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called “10/90 gap”, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world’s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right. Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick. Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability. To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors. There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera. For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come. For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.', 'charCount': '26005', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false',

One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day.</p> <p>But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time.</p> <p>For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=""https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/"" title="""">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=""https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera"" title="""">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.”</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera’s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm"" title="""">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg"" alt=""A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001."" width=""1000"" height=""656"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up.

This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg"" title="""">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=""https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854"" title="""">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg"" alt=""A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854."" width=""800"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow’s revelations led to the creation of “Improvement Trusts” and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=""https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/"" title="""">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=""http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/"" title="""">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn’t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=""http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf"" title="""">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “<em>vibrios</em>” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=""https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/"" title="""">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De"" title="""">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg"" alt=""A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=""https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf"" title="""">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=""https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c"" title="""">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html"" title="""">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext"" title="""">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=""https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7"" title="""">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic"" title="""">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=""https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/"" title="""">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/"" title="""">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/"" title="""">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=""https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1"" title="""">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/"" title="""">47 countries</a> – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=""https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211"" title="""">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1"" title="""">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=""https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose"" title="""">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts"" title="""">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=""https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever"" title="""">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=""https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/"" title="""">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik"" title="""">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/"" title="""">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg"" alt=""An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017."" width=""1000"" height=""667"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called “10/90 gap”, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world’s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=""https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/"" title="""">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus"" title="""">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=""https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls"" title="""">has written</a> that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html"" title="""">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=""https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort"" title="""">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=""https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/"" title="""">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/gdnlongread"" title="""">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email"" title="""">here</a>.</p>",4337,,2020-05-01T05:00:15Z,false,false,2020-05-04T17:01:47Z,UK,The Guardian,https://gu.com/p/dmqtv,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/056e89f4217902ea1a711b2cd9b480d4e6ef1bd0/0_80_6220_3732/500.jpg,false,en,true,"We log in every day at 7.45am. One by one, we join an array of faces on our screens. We doctors aren’t used to video-conferencing like this, and still greet each other with excited waving hands. Since the coronavirus crisis began, these daily virtual meetings have proved an invaluable way to keep up to speed on clinical guidelines, in-house protocols and staff wellbeing – all of which are changing every day. But these meetings also bring us news that we take more personally: how many of our patients have symptoms? How many have tested positive? How many have died? These are important questions, for sure, but my public health training reminds me to think globally. The coming year will see developments that will allow us to bring the virus under control in the west, but what about in other countries? I cannot help but think of my relatives in India, and what this pandemic will mean for them – not just now, but in the future. The really important question is not who will die of coronavirus tomorrow, but in 200 years’ time. For coronavirus is not the only pandemic the world faces. There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away. While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world. * * * To reach my grandparents’ house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region’s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area’s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits – mangoes, lychees and guava – that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents. The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old inscription at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the clinical picture of patients afflicted by severe cholera: “The lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.” In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices. Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don’t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours. For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera’s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which originated in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it. Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half. In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s. In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called Isabella Hazard. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly. It is hard to imagine the panic created by the “Blue Death”, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory – that the disease was associated with “bad airs” (or “miasmas”) – inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets “to destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys”. So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing millions of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary Mario Adorno accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting “a devilish plot bent on poisoning the people” of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them. But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive – they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy. * * * In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks. When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by “miasmas”. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a dot map of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same water pump on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water. This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow’s revelations led to the creation of “Improvement Trusts” and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but only 1% of Indians outside the colonial walls. Today, more than half of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn’t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people. * * * John Snow’s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick. In Florence, a contemporary of Snow’s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool. Pacini studied the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue. Pacini recognised that these dots – which he called “vibrios” (commas), because of their shape – must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades. Pacini had discovered the “germ”, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, Hemanda Nath Chatterjee developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today. Six years later, Sambhu Nath De discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed – like whole spices – even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease. These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin. Today, it’s easy for westerners to get their hands on the most effective vaccine, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It’s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will protect you for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don’t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the average Indian farmer would have to work for three whole days. There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That’s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India. There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes – the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera. So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK. Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera’s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De’s seminal research, a new pandemic – the seventh – sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth. * * * In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution. This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first International Sanitary Conference, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892. According to Anne-Emanuelle Birn, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the WHO. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated – not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, cholera claimed more lives than the coronavirus. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west. * * * A map of the places still struggling with cholera shows 47 countries – in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer have shown, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates – despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart. The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on another nearby island, Ebeye. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to nine people, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets. At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001. On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case. What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people. It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera. * * * There are fears that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the four endemic coronaviruses; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world’s poorest regions. The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world. There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries buying up so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the outsourcing of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world’s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the digital infrastructure necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks. It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called “10/90 gap”, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world’s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right. Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, has compared the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls “Global Health 4.0”: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump’s removal of funding, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick. Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone’s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam has written that “enormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability”. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability. To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a “communitarian globalism”: a bottom-up approach, “based on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources”. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the communist government in Kerala giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the Somalian doctors offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to Cuba allowing an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors. There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera. For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come. For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years’ time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",26005,false,false,"<a href=""profile/neil-singh"">Neil Singh</a>",,immersive,5,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-05-01,2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,0

Is Johnson up to this?, 2 April). At that time, an intelligent but lazy prime minister with a complicated love life, renowned for deferring difficult decisions, was accused by the press and sections of his own party – as well opposition politicians – of inaction and drift. It seemed obvious that a collective national action plan, involving all sectors of industry and the body politic, was urgently needed if the country were to avoid a national catastrophe. Comparisons with Germany’s far better state of preparedness were added to charges of incompetence levelled at the prime minister at that time of national crisis. Unfortunately, today we seem to lack a Lloyd George – a man of energy and wide popularity, commanding the respect of all sides of the house and the country, and seen by friend and foe alike as the only man with the necessary will and gravitas, as well as a brutal willingness to abandon a former friend and colleague, to lead us through these dark times. Unless, of course, the present chancellor of the exchequer, like his predecessor Lloyd George, at some point decides there is no alternative but to knife his friend the PM in the back. To emulate Lloyd George, Rishi Sunak would need to get the new leader of the opposition on board and, preferably, sitting with him in a new government of national unity. That prospect might seem improbable now but, as this crisis unfolds, who knows? Stranger things have happened.

South Korea had been praised for its innovative efforts to contain the pandemic, going from the second most infected region outside China to having just a handful of cases before the latest outbreak a week ago. But the increasing number of cases related to nightclubs in Seoul is raising concerns about a possible second wave as well as over the high level of deeply entrenched homophobic attitudes in the conservative society. Of 35 new cases, 29 were found to be linked to Itaewon, the capital’s gay district, according to officials from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), bringing the total number of cases related to the clubs to 86. The emergence of the cluster prompted officials to push back the re-opening of schools by one week, with students initially set to return to classes in stages starting Wednesday. Vice-education minister Park Baeg-beom said the delay was “inevitable” in order to guarantee the safety of students. After Kookmin Ilbo, a local media outlet with links to an evangelical church, reported that businesses visited by an infected man over the long weekend were gay clubs, many other South Korean media followed suit, revealing not only the identity of clientele but also some of their ages and the names of their workplaces. The media frenzy reached a new level when another infected man was found to have been to an LGBT sauna in Gangnam, prompting a slew of homophobic content in newspapers and online. Lurid reporting, along with South Korea’s use of the trace and test method, has led to members of the gay community reporting feeling scared to get tested and even suicidal. Officials said 3,112 people who were in the nightclubs were currently not contactable. “I admit it was a huge mistake to visit the gay district when the corona situation was not fully over,” Lee Youngwu , a gay man in his30s, told the Guardian “But visiting the area is the only time when I can be myself and hang out with others similar to me.

In offering assistance with shopping, prescription collection, gardening, household maintenance, dog walking and, above all, the chance to talk on the telephone, they offer admirable reminders of football’s role as a form of social glue and the symbiotic, interdependent relationships binding clubs to their communities.</p> <p>“The coronavirus restrictions on over-70s and the vulnerable will undoubtedly cause anguish for those folks that can’t use the internet, have no relatives and no way of ordering supplies or obtaining meals,” says Wallace. “We’ve always prided ourselves on being a community club and now it’s time to show what that means.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/barnet-lay-off-all-non-playing-staff-coronavirus-national-league"">Barnet lay off all non-playing staff as club counts cost of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A long drive up the A1 in Scotland’s central lowlands, Iain McMenemy, Stenhousemuir’s chairman, is banging a similar drum as he embarks on a similar mission.

We have kitchens we’re not using and young players who can’t play football so, if it means we cook food and prepare snacks, if it’s getting essential supplies to people, that’s what we’ll do. We will be there.”</p> <p>Already Alex Tunbridge, Stevenage’s chief executive, has organised a community careline for the over-70s, offering food deliveries, prescription collection and dog walking in addition to signposting advice about accessing specialist local services and businesses.

As if being stuck to the bottom of League Two were not bad enough, Stevenage’s chairman fears the financial ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic could force his club to fold. For the moment, though, he is concentrating on even more urgent priorities. Along with Scotland’s Stenhousemuir, Stevenage have placed themselves at the vanguard of initiatives whereby football clubs effectively transform themselves into emergency branches of the social services, offering lifelines to the elderly and the vulnerable placed in solitary confinement by the threat from Covid-19. Both clubs have launched carelines designed to provide those whose might otherwise slip through the usual safety nets with help in confronting the practical, logistical and mental challenges of life behind closed doors. In offering assistance with shopping, prescription collection, gardening, household maintenance, dog walking and, above all, the chance to talk on the telephone, they offer admirable reminders of football’s role as a form of social glue and the symbiotic, interdependent relationships binding clubs to their communities. “The coronavirus restrictions on over-70s and the vulnerable will undoubtedly cause anguish for those folks that can’t use the internet, have no relatives and no way of ordering supplies or obtaining meals,” says Wallace. “We’ve always prided ourselves on being a community club and now it’s time to show what that means.” A long drive up the A1 in Scotland’s central lowlands, Iain McMenemy, Stenhousemuir’s chairman, is banging a similar drum as he embarks on a similar mission. He accepts his part-time League Two club will lose “tens of thousands of pounds” during football’s shutdown but, mindful of the potentially immense damage to mental health to those effectively imprisoned in their homes, McMenemy hopes to mitigate depression and fear while also providing life’s basic necessities. His solution has been to establish a club hotline staffed by volunteers which matches a growing army of helpers, including suddenly underemployed club coaches, to individual local needs which might range from fixing a broken fence to grass cutting and sourcing toilet rolls and pasta to engaging in an hour-long chat. “We must look beyond our own problems at the club,” says McMenemy. “We must best serve the needs of our community by helping the most vulnerable.” Wallace’s football-related “problems” are arguably even more deep-seated. “We have no idea how long the club can survive without matchday income whilst paying players and staff,” he says. “But some people have nobody and we’ll make sure we’re there for them. We have kitchens we’re not using and young players who can’t play football so, if it means we cook food and prepare snacks, if it’s getting essential supplies to people, that’s what we’ll do. We will be there.” Already Alex Tunbridge, Stevenage’s chief executive, has organised a community careline for the over-70s, offering food deliveries, prescription collection and dog walking in addition to signposting advice about accessing specialist local services and businesses. On Tuesday he briefed club staff detailing their changing roles as they are redeployed to the careline. “As a local community organisation, we’ve got two choices: we either shut the club or change our product and services to meet local needs,” he says. “We are no longer a football club at present. We are turning the club into a community careline. “We’re embedded in our community. We need our community to support this club and that’s what we ask for week in, week out, but the role’s been reversed. It’s our time to give back to our community and that’s the mantra of everyone involved. We could have players on the phone just having a chat to people.

He will be remembered for his versatile performances across different mediums. My thoughts are with his family, friends and admirers. May his soul rest in peace.”</p> \n<p>Fellow Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan said Khan’s death left a “huge vacuum”. “An incredible talent, a gracious colleague, a prolific contributor to the world of cinema … left us too soon,” tweeted Bachchan.</p> \n<p>“The charisma you brought to everything you did was pure magic,” tweeted Priyanka Chopra. “Your talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues.

Because that industry has its own technique, its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood.

He struggled to make headway in the film industry, despite being cast <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8GPnm73CEw"">in a small role as a letter writer</a> in Mira Nair’s 1988 Salaam Bombay! – to his frustration he only managed to find regular work in low-grade TV soap operas.</p> \n<p>“I came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television,” <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/25/irrfan-khan-bollywood-d-day"">he told the Guardian</a>.</p> \n<p>Khan’s breakthrough role came from an unlikely source: the feature debut of then-unknown British director Asif Kapadia, whose low budget samurai-esque tale, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/03/artsfeatures"">The Warrior</a>, was shot in India. Released in 2002, The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebastián film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film.

He had been admitted to the intensive care unit of Mumbai’s Kokilaben hospital on Tuesday with a colon infection and on Wednesday morning a statement was released confirming his death. “It’s saddening that this day, we have to bring forward the news of him passing away,” read the statement. “Irrfan was a strong soul, someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him.” Despite his status as one of Bollywood’s most celebrated actors, Khan had a reputation for modesty and integrity and news of his death sent India into mourning, prompting actors, fans and politicians from across the world to express their sadness at his death. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said that Khan’s demise was “a loss to the world of cinema and theatre. He will be remembered for his versatile performances across different mediums. My thoughts are with his family, friends and admirers. May his soul rest in peace.” Fellow Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan said Khan’s death left a “huge vacuum”. “An incredible talent, a gracious colleague, a prolific contributor to the world of cinema … left us too soon,” tweeted Bachchan. “The charisma you brought to everything you did was pure magic,” tweeted Priyanka Chopra. “Your talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues. You inspired so many of us. Irrfan Khan you will truly be missed. Condolences to the family.” Indian politician Rahul Gandhi described Khan as a “versatile and talented actor” who would be “greatly missed” while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said India had lost “one of the most exceptional actors of our time.” In March 2018, Khan revealed he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour, but after extensive treatment he recovered well enough to shoot Angrezi Medium, the film that would turn out to be his last, and whose release this March was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Best known to English-speaking audiences as the police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire and for his roles in Jurassic World and Life of Pi, Khan was a Bollywood mainstay, acting in hits such as Haider, Piku and Hindi Medium. “I always object to the word Bollywood,” he told the Guardian in 2013. “I don’t think it’s fair to have that name. Because that industry has its own technique, its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood. It originates in Parsi theatre.” Khan was born Saahabzaade Irfan Ali Khan in Jaipur in 1966, the son of a tyre seller, and went to drama school after failing as a cricketer. He struggled to make headway in the film industry, despite being cast in a small role as a letter writer in Mira Nair’s 1988 Salaam Bombay! – to his frustration he only managed to find regular work in low-grade TV soap operas. “I came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television,” he told the Guardian. Khan’s breakthrough role came from an unlikely source: the feature debut of then-unknown British director Asif Kapadia, whose low budget samurai-esque tale, The Warrior, was shot in India. Released in 2002, The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebastián film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film. Khan subsequently broke into mainstream Indian films, often playing cops or villains – including the title role of Maqbool, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth set in the Mumbai underworld. More orthodox Bollywood productions followed, such as Rog and the slice-of-life musical Life in a … Metro. Khan also maintained a parallel career in British-American cinema: he played the chief of police in Michael Winterbottom’s A Mighty Heart, and another police officer in Slumdog Millionaire, which won eight Oscars. In later roles, he became a reliable standby character actor in big-budget Hollywood films, playing a doctor in The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 and businessmen in Jurassic World (2015) and Inferno (2016).

So many things have been postponed and I agree with this move.”</p> <p>The director, who is the festival’s first black jury presiden, added: “Everybody has to pray, get on bended knee, pray we get out of this, find a vaccine, get back on our feet – physically, emotionally and financially worldwide.

And that sort of continued on <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8332922/"" title="""">A Quiet Place 2</a>.”</p> <p>You, too, might need a tumbler of scotch while watching the film. Blunt describes it as a “runaway train that grips you by the neck”, which is half-right. It also takes that neck and lays it on the tracks before running over it repeatedly. “I realised what an investment people had in this family from the first film,” says Blunt. “Everyone asked: ‘What happens next?’”</p> <p>Now the answer is on the way. As if the audience had gone out for a two-year loo break, the new movie picks up at the very moment the first one ended — with Blunt’s wounded matriarch, Evelyn Abbott, and her three surviving children in the basement of their farm after fending off an alien attack. Try to imagine giving birth in such a nightmare landscape and you have the plot of A Quiet Place. Take the newborn out into the world, to face fresh dangers, and you have A Quiet Place Part 2.</p> <p>“At its core, it’s about motherhood, it’s about parenthood, it’s about how far you’d go to protect your children,” Blunt says. “It turns out you’d go a really long way.”</p> <p>Scotch is not being served in the New York hotel suite where we meet. Instead, there’s abstemious pots of earl grey and three sorry biscuits. Blunt contemplates a trio of jugs with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. “So many different milks here,” she says. “I think that’s the one I want. This is real milk, not fake,” she says approvingly, offering it over. “The idea of oat milk probably makes you feel a bit sick.”</p> <p>Blunt has a ready – and pleasing – facility to make you feel noticed. It’s easy to see why she was such tip-top casting for Mary Poppins, though her daughters, Hazel, five, and Violet, three, prefer the 1964 original. “They’ve seen mine once and that seemed to be enough for them,” says Blunt. “Whereas Julie Andrews has been watched on a loop.” Her acting self confuses them, she says. Her first priority coming back from work is to remove her makeup so they recognise her.</p> <p>Mary Poppins and A Quiet Place were released in 2018. In the former, she glides down into a picturesque London on the end of a parrot-handled brolly. In the latter, she gives birth alone, bloodied and terrorised, in a hell-blasted landscape. Both are about the promise parents make to their children to keep them safe; but in A Quiet Place, and its sequel, we see what happens when that promise can’t be kept.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFyfGEoOGc4""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RFyfGEoOGc4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>“If the first movie is about parenthood, I think that the second one is very much about that idea of a fractured sense of community,” says Blunt. “It’s really diving into human beings and how they’re affected by a crisis, and who’s resilient enough to withstand this kind of thing and still extend your hand to your neighbour.”</p> <p>It may be unintentionally ironic, but at the time of writing, A Quiet Place 2’s release has been postponed as the coronavirus crisis takes hold. Covid-19 aside, the sense of a world in freefall was always “very intentional”, says Blunt. Krasinski, who wrote and directed the film as well as starring in it, “just felt this untethered feeling in the world, in which community and the idea of community is under threat, led by our fears, by our fears of people who are different from us, by our own need for survival”.</p> <p>The outsider this time round is one of the Abbotts’ neighbours, played by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/08/cillian-murphy-peaky-blinders-james-bond-brexit"" title="""">Cillian Murphy</a> – himself a veteran at navigating post-apocalyptic landscapes. Murphy’s breakout, zombies-on-acid horror 28 Days Later hit cinemas in November 2002, just as Sars was exploding in southern China. In the early moments of A Quiet Place 2, we catch glimpses of news reports of mass casualties in Shanghai, a jarring reminder that today’s headlines often play like a movie despite real-world tragedy. “Everyone is walking around with a low level of anxiety about the state of the world, how we’re abusing it, and about the capacity of the people in charge,” Murphy tells me over the phone. “That’s why these films tap into people’s psyches and get under their skin.”</p> <p>Being a couple on screen has inevitably raised the profile of Blunt and Krasinski’s real marriage, but Blunt seems unwilling to play the celeb-couple game. When Graham Norton asked her in 2018 if she and Krasinski had a portmanteau like Brangelina or Bennifer, Blunt shot back: “Krunt.” She is not on social media, has no plans to be and ferociously guards the separation between her public and private lives. She and Krasinski named their first daughter Hazel after the Nick Drake song <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2446-a-treasury/"" title="""">Hazey Jane</a>, she says, but asked if she can recall the first time they listened to it, she replies – with a compensating smile – “I do and I’m not going to share it.” Living in Brooklyn helps. “No one bothers us, we walk around, we don’t have a car, it’s very manageable,” she says. “I don’t know many other neighbourhoods where we would find it as easy.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""dac2d24447007245aea0c63eb0fbcff559cf825f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/dac2d24447007245aea0c63eb0fbcff559cf825f/0_0_1794_858/1000.jpg"" alt=""As Mary Poppins."" width=""1000"" height=""478"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">As Mary Poppins.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Courtesy of Disney/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hazey Jane off the table, Blunt does tell the story of introducing Krasinski to her parents over Sunday roast at their house. “My father likes to present the beef sort of barely cooked,” Blunt says, and then lowers her voice a few octaves to imitate her father requesting his steak be served “<em>bleu</em>”, his doner kebab rare. Anyway, Krasinski, true to his Boston upbringing, made not a murmur of protest. “It is my lasting memory of how John coped with that situation, as someone who prefers things a bit more medium.”</p> <p>Raised in Roehampton, London – not a million miles from the Reigate constituency of her uncle, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt – Blunt was privately educated and doesn’t mind saying her parents are properly posh. She studied recordings of Princess Margaret to nail Poppins’ clipped vowels; possibly a chat with her mother might have sufficed. The second of four children, Blunt says she was “the naughty one who wanted to go clubbing on holiday”. This was permitted only if her older sister, Felicity, went along too – which essentially kiboshed the plan. “She’d bring a suitcase of 10 books and read them all over two weeks,” Blunt recalls. Now a literary agent, Felicity keeps her sister’s bedside table stacked: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/17/things-in-jars-jess-kidd-review"" title="""">Things in Jars by Jess Kidd</a> is currently on top; below is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/08/lanny-max-porter-review"" title="""">Max Porter’s Lanny</a>. “God, but it’s <em>so good</em>. Reading it was a visceral experience.”</p> <p>As a child, Blunt aspired to be a translator, but fell into acting as a handy way to manage a stutter. A student production in Edinburgh sealed the deal; next thing she knew she was starring alongside Judi Dench on stage. She arrived on screen in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1332467,00.html"" title="""">My Summer of Love</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/09/pawel-pawlikowski-poland-cold-war-ida"" title="""">Pawel Pawlikowski</a>’s gorgeous coming-of-age tale. In the 16 years since, Blunt has made 32 movies; not many shy of Kate Winslet, the actor whose career – and no-nonsense charm – Blunt’s most seems to resemble.</p> <p>“I’ve been lucky because the films that I built my whole career on, those $25m- to $35m-budget films like <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/sicario-review-emily-blunt-at-the-sharp-end-in-war-on-drugs"" title="""">Sicario</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama"" title="""">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, aren’t really being made any more,” she says. “It’s a shame because those films were really clever and beautifully crafted, and people ended up actually seeing them.” Her career has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles. “She doesn’t phone anything in,” says Tate Taylor, who directed her in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/03/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins"" title="""">The Girl on a Train.</a> “You just lean into her when she’s on screen, and you have to possess that.”</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f00484dabb8cf1649d41707afa99b46ef2592fbb""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f00484dabb8cf1649d41707afa99b46ef2592fbb/0_0_3504_2439/1000.jpg"" alt=""With Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in A Quiet Place 2."" width=""1000"" height=""696"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">With Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in A Quiet Place 2.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, Blunt wrote to Pawlikowski to thank him for “giving me instinctive tools. Working with him was so freewheeling and terrifying, because there was no script and it was improvised, so it’s a weird feeling of jumping off a cliff every day. All you had was instinct.” Blunt does a good impression of Pawlikowski scoffing at “Hollywood bullshit”, but the director’s scepticism found its mark. Working with him, she says, has “always encouraged me to stretch a scene around and to question it, and make sure you find the most interesting way in”.</p> <p>Next, Blunt starts work on her first TV project proper: The English, a BBC western by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088372/"" title="""">Hugo Blick</a>, the man behind The Honourable Woman. She won’t give details, save that she signed on immediately. “I literally called my husband and said: ‘I just read one page of a script and I’m doing it.’”</p> <p>Actually, she has done some TV before: bit parts in Foyle’s War and Poirot and, four years ago, a turn on Saturday Night Live. “I’ve never been more scared in my life,” she shudders. “I get anxiety just thinking about it. The whole week was such a whirlwind because Violet was nine weeks old so I just wasn’t sleeping.”</p> <p>There’s a reason there’s a vomit bucket just offstage, she says. “I mean, I didn’t puke in it, but it’s there. It was just this completely alternate reality. This amazing woman who has looked after the talent going in there to host it for years just wrestled me around the sets and stripped my clothes off. I mean <em>tearing</em> the clothes off me. I remember her standing by that door and they’re like: ‘Live from New York!’ and she’s rubbing my back very firmly and I’m moving with it, and she goes: ‘You’re OK, you’re all right, you’re OK, breathe, you’re OK, OK, you’re up.’ Honestly, it’s like a nightmare. The thought of it now, it makes me sweat.”</p> <p>And a Quiet Place 3 just got its plot.</p> <p><em>A Quiet Place 2 will be released later this year</em></p> <p>•&nbsp;This article was amended on 13 March 2020 because Nick Drake’s song Hazey Jane, was misnamed Hazy Jane.

As if the audience had gone out for a two-year loo break, the new movie picks up at the very moment the first one ended — with Blunt’s wounded matriarch, Evelyn Abbott, and her three surviving children in the basement of their farm after fending off an alien attack. Try to imagine giving birth in such a nightmare landscape and you have the plot of A Quiet Place. Take the newborn out into the world, to face fresh dangers, and you have A Quiet Place Part 2. “At its core, it’s about motherhood, it’s about parenthood, it’s about how far you’d go to protect your children,” Blunt says. “It turns out you’d go a really long way.” Scotch is not being served in the New York hotel suite where we meet. Instead, there’s abstemious pots of earl grey and three sorry biscuits. Blunt contemplates a trio of jugs with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. “So many different milks here,” she says. “I think that’s the one I want. This is real milk, not fake,” she says approvingly, offering it over. “The idea of oat milk probably makes you feel a bit sick.” Blunt has a ready – and pleasing – facility to make you feel noticed. It’s easy to see why she was such tip-top casting for Mary Poppins, though her daughters, Hazel, five, and Violet, three, prefer the 1964 original. “They’ve seen mine once and that seemed to be enough for them,” says Blunt. “Whereas Julie Andrews has been watched on a loop.” Her acting self confuses them, she says. Her first priority coming back from work is to remove her makeup so they recognise her. Mary Poppins and A Quiet Place were released in 2018. In the former, she glides down into a picturesque London on the end of a parrot-handled brolly. In the latter, she gives birth alone, bloodied and terrorised, in a hell-blasted landscape. Both are about the promise parents make to their children to keep them safe; but in A Quiet Place, and its sequel, we see what happens when that promise can’t be kept. “If the first movie is about parenthood, I think that the second one is very much about that idea of a fractured sense of community,” says Blunt. “It’s really diving into human beings and how they’re affected by a crisis, and who’s resilient enough to withstand this kind of thing and still extend your hand to your neighbour.” It may be unintentionally ironic, but at the time of writing, A Quiet Place 2’s release has been postponed as the coronavirus crisis takes hold. Covid-19 aside, the sense of a world in freefall was always “very intentional”, says Blunt. Krasinski, who wrote and directed the film as well as starring in it, “just felt this untethered feeling in the world, in which community and the idea of community is under threat, led by our fears, by our fears of people who are different from us, by our own need for survival”. The outsider this time round is one of the Abbotts’ neighbours, played by Cillian Murphy – himself a veteran at navigating post-apocalyptic landscapes. Murphy’s breakout, zombies-on-acid horror 28 Days Later hit cinemas in November 2002, just as Sars was exploding in southern China. In the early moments of A Quiet Place 2, we catch glimpses of news reports of mass casualties in Shanghai, a jarring reminder that today’s headlines often play like a movie despite real-world tragedy. “Everyone is walking around with a low level of anxiety about the state of the world, how we’re abusing it, and about the capacity of the people in charge,” Murphy tells me over the phone. “That’s why these films tap into people’s psyches and get under their skin.” Being a couple on screen has inevitably raised the profile of Blunt and Krasinski’s real marriage, but Blunt seems unwilling to play the celeb-couple game. When Graham Norton asked her in 2018 if she and Krasinski had a portmanteau like Brangelina or Bennifer, Blunt shot back: “Krunt.” She is not on social media, has no plans to be and ferociously guards the separation between her public and private lives. She and Krasinski named their first daughter Hazel after the Nick Drake song Hazey Jane, she says, but asked if she can recall the first time they listened to it, she replies – with a compensating smile – “I do and I’m not going to share it.” Living in Brooklyn helps. “No one bothers us, we walk around, we don’t have a car, it’s very manageable,” she says. “I don’t know many other neighbourhoods where we would find it as easy.” Hazey Jane off the table, Blunt does tell the story of introducing Krasinski to her parents over Sunday roast at their house. “My father likes to present the beef sort of barely cooked,” Blunt says, and then lowers her voice a few octaves to imitate her father requesting his steak be served “bleu”, his doner kebab rare. Anyway, Krasinski, true to his Boston upbringing, made not a murmur of protest. “It is my lasting memory of how John coped with that situation, as someone who prefers things a bit more medium.” Raised in Roehampton, London – not a million miles from the Reigate constituency of her uncle, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt – Blunt was privately educated and doesn’t mind saying her parents are properly posh. She studied recordings of Princess Margaret to nail Poppins’ clipped vowels; possibly a chat with her mother might have sufficed. The second of four children, Blunt says she was “the naughty one who wanted to go clubbing on holiday”. This was permitted only if her older sister, Felicity, went along too – which essentially kiboshed the plan. “She’d bring a suitcase of 10 books and read them all over two weeks,” Blunt recalls. Now a literary agent, Felicity keeps her sister’s bedside table stacked: Things in Jars by Jess Kidd is currently on top; below is Max Porter’s Lanny. “God, but it’s so good. Reading it was a visceral experience.” As a child, Blunt aspired to be a translator, but fell into acting as a handy way to manage a stutter. A student production in Edinburgh sealed the deal; next thing she knew she was starring alongside Judi Dench on stage. She arrived on screen in My Summer of Love, Pawel Pawlikowski’s gorgeous coming-of-age tale. In the 16 years since, Blunt has made 32 movies; not many shy of Kate Winslet, the actor whose career – and no-nonsense charm – Blunt’s most seems to resemble. “I’ve been lucky because the films that I built my whole career on, those $25m- to $35m-budget films like Sicario and The Devil Wears Prada, aren’t really being made any more,” she says. “It’s a shame because those films were really clever and beautifully crafted, and people ended up actually seeing them.” Her career has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles. “She doesn’t phone anything in,” says Tate Taylor, who directed her in The Girl on a Train. “You just lean into her when she’s on screen, and you have to possess that.” Recently, Blunt wrote to Pawlikowski to thank him for “giving me instinctive tools. Working with him was so freewheeling and terrifying, because there was no script and it was improvised, so it’s a weird feeling of jumping off a cliff every day. All you had was instinct.” Blunt does a good impression of Pawlikowski scoffing at “Hollywood bullshit”, but the director’s scepticism found its mark. Working with him, she says, has “always encouraged me to stretch a scene around and to question it, and make sure you find the most interesting way in”. Next, Blunt starts work on her first TV project proper: The English, a BBC western by Hugo Blick, the man behind The Honourable Woman. She won’t give details, save that she signed on immediately. “I literally called my husband and said: ‘I just read one page of a script and I’m doing it.’” Actually, she has done some TV before: bit parts in Foyle’s War and Poirot and, four years ago, a turn on Saturday Night Live. “I’ve never been more scared in my life,” she shudders. “I get anxiety just thinking about it. The whole week was such a whirlwind because Violet was nine weeks old so I just wasn’t sleeping.” There’s a reason there’s a vomit bucket just offstage, she says. “I mean, I didn’t puke in it, but it’s there. It was just this completely alternate reality. This amazing woman who has looked after the talent going in there to host it for years just wrestled me around the sets and stripped my clothes off. I mean tearing the clothes off me. I remember her standing by that door and they’re like: ‘Live from New York!’ and she’s rubbing my back very firmly and I’m moving with it, and she goes: ‘You’re OK, you’re all right, you’re OK, breathe, you’re OK, OK, you’re up.’ Honestly, it’s like a nightmare. The thought of it now, it makes me sweat.” And a Quiet Place 3 just got its plot. A Quiet Place 2 will be released later this year • This article was amended on 13 March 2020 because Nick Drake’s song Hazey Jane, was misnamed Hazy Jane.

Krasinski, who wrote and directed the film as well as starring in it, “just felt this untethered feeling in the world, in which community and the idea of community is under threat, led by our fears, by our fears of people who are different from us, by our own need for survival”. The outsider this time round is one of the Abbotts’ neighbours, played by Cillian Murphy – himself a veteran at navigating post-apocalyptic landscapes. Murphy’s breakout, zombies-on-acid horror 28 Days Later hit cinemas in November 2002, just as Sars was exploding in southern China. In the early moments of A Quiet Place 2, we catch glimpses of news reports of mass casualties in Shanghai, a jarring reminder that today’s headlines often play like a movie despite real-world tragedy. “Everyone is walking around with a low level of anxiety about the state of the world, how we’re abusing it, and about the capacity of the people in charge,” Murphy tells me over the phone. “That’s why these films tap into people’s psyches and get under their skin.” Being a couple on screen has inevitably raised the profile of Blunt and Krasinski’s real marriage, but Blunt seems unwilling to play the celeb-couple game. When Graham Norton asked her in 2018 if she and Krasinski had a portmanteau like Brangelina or Bennifer, Blunt shot back: “Krunt.” She is not on social media, has no plans to be and ferociously guards the separation between her public and private lives. She and Krasinski named their first daughter Hazel after the Nick Drake song Hazey Jane, she says, but asked if she can recall the first time they listened to it, she replies – with a compensating smile – “I do and I’m not going to share it.” Living in Brooklyn helps. “No one bothers us, we walk around, we don’t have a car, it’s very manageable,” she says. “I don’t know many other neighbourhoods where we would find it as easy.” Hazey Jane off the table, Blunt does tell the story of introducing Krasinski to her parents over Sunday roast at their house. “My father likes to present the beef sort of barely cooked,” Blunt says, and then lowers her voice a few octaves to imitate her father requesting his steak be served “bleu”, his doner kebab rare. Anyway, Krasinski, true to his Boston upbringing, made not a murmur of protest. “It is my lasting memory of how John coped with that situation, as someone who prefers things a bit more medium.” Raised in Roehampton, London – not a million miles from the Reigate constituency of her uncle, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt – Blunt was privately educated and doesn’t mind saying her parents are properly posh. She studied recordings of Princess Margaret to nail Poppins’ clipped vowels; possibly a chat with her mother might have sufficed. The second of four children, Blunt says she was “the naughty one who wanted to go clubbing on holiday”. This was permitted only if her older sister, Felicity, went along too – which essentially kiboshed the plan. “She’d bring a suitcase of 10 books and read them all over two weeks,” Blunt recalls. Now a literary agent, Felicity keeps her sister’s bedside table stacked: Things in Jars by Jess Kidd is currently on top; below is Max Porter’s Lanny. “God, but it’s so good. Reading it was a visceral experience.” As a child, Blunt aspired to be a translator, but fell into acting as a handy way to manage a stutter. A student production in Edinburgh sealed the deal; next thing she knew she was starring alongside Judi Dench on stage. She arrived on screen in My Summer of Love, Pawel Pawlikowski’s gorgeous coming-of-age tale. In the 16 years since, Blunt has made 32 movies; not many shy of Kate Winslet, the actor whose career – and no-nonsense charm – Blunt’s most seems to resemble. “I’ve been lucky because the films that I built my whole career on, those $25m- to $35m-budget films like Sicario and The Devil Wears Prada, aren’t really being made any more,” she says. “It’s a shame because those films were really clever and beautifully crafted, and people ended up actually seeing them.” Her career has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles. “She doesn’t phone anything in,” says Tate Taylor, who directed her in The Girl on a Train. “You just lean into her when she’s on screen, and you have to possess that.” Recently, Blunt wrote to Pawlikowski to thank him for “giving me instinctive tools. Working with him was so freewheeling and terrifying, because there was no script and it was improvised, so it’s a weird feeling of jumping off a cliff every day. All you had was instinct.” Blunt does a good impression of Pawlikowski scoffing at “Hollywood bullshit”, but the director’s scepticism found its mark. Working with him, she says, has “always encouraged me to stretch a scene around and to question it, and make sure you find the most interesting way in”. Next, Blunt starts work on her first TV project proper: The English, a BBC western by Hugo Blick, the man behind The Honourable Woman. She won’t give details, save that she signed on immediately. “I literally called my husband and said: ‘I just read one page of a script and I’m doing it.’” Actually, she has done some TV before: bit parts in Foyle’s War and Poirot and, four years ago, a turn on Saturday Night Live. “I’ve never been more scared in my life,” she shudders. “I get anxiety just thinking about it. The whole week was such a whirlwind because Violet was nine weeks old so I just wasn’t sleeping.” There’s a reason there’s a vomit bucket just offstage, she says. “I mean, I didn’t puke in it, but it’s there. It was just this completely alternate reality. This amazing woman who has looked after the talent going in there to host it for years just wrestled me around the sets and stripped my clothes off. I mean tearing the clothes off me. I remember her standing by that door and they’re like: ‘Live from New York!’ and she’s rubbing my back very firmly and I’m moving with it, and she goes: ‘You’re OK, you’re all right, you’re OK, breathe, you’re OK, OK, you’re up.’ Honestly, it’s like a nightmare. The thought of it now, it makes me sweat.” And a Quiet Place 3 just got its plot. A Quiet Place 2 will be released later this year • This article was amended on 13 March 2020 because Nick Drake’s song Hazey Jane, was misnamed Hazy Jane.

Only weeks ago, I wrote of the burden of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/im-happy-to-announce-how-we-entered-a-great-big-era-of-boastfulness"">“thrilled to announce”</a> culture – the growing pressure to publicly declare every and any work win online. The universe has since intervened, ridding us of opportunities. With vast postponements and cancellations because of social distancing, there is little for most of us to be thrilled about and even less to announce.</p> <p>At first, many coped by mournfully listing the lost opportunities they would have announced but for the pandemic. Now, as several days have passed and lockdown is official, our <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-spend-lives-online-social-media"">social media accounts are catching up</a> with this sudden change. We are pivoting to sharing news about our personal hobbies– knitting, bread baking and gardening – instead of side hustling. I have discovered that people I followed for years have a passion for singing that they’ve never had time to share; I am watching ex-colleagues learning to play instruments. And I’ve been able to pursue my dream of learning to sculpt.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cabin-fever-the-best-celebrities-to-follow-from-robbie-williams-to-florence-pugh"">Instagram has </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cabin-fever-the-best-celebrities-to-follow-from-robbie-williams-to-florence-pugh""> </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cabin-fever-the-best-celebrities-to-follow-from-robbie-williams-to-florence-pugh"">aided this </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cabin-fever-the-best-celebrities-to-follow-from-robbie-williams-to-florence-pugh"">shift</a>, releasing a Stay Home sticker to add to your posts, encouraging users to share what they are doing while isolated, such as showing followers how they are passing the time, and vice versa. These updates are less about professional point scoring and more: “PERSONAL NEWS: I’ve just made and eaten my third banana cake of the week!”</p> <p>Of course, that isn’t to say that home living will remain wholesome and uncompetitive: there are tangible gains to be made during this strange period. The stock market may have plunged, but coronavirus has seen the clout economy boom: three days ago, American DJ D-Nice jumped from having 200,000 followers to 1.3 million on Instagram after a livestreamed dance set that even Michelle Obama tuned into. “The Body Coach” Joe Wicks has become a household name, after conducting daily PE lessons from his living room for schoolchildren.

Take Madonna, the world-famous multi-millionaire who declared Covid-19 “the great equaliser” on Twitter and Instagram in since-deleted posts. “We are all in the same boat” she said, sitting surrounded by rose petals in a bath that, were it to be sold, the funds raised could probably see me through the looming recession. “And if the ship goes down, we’re all going down together,” she added. And yet, coronavirus is still in some small ways a leveller. Only weeks ago, I wrote of the burden of “thrilled to announce” culture – the growing pressure to publicly declare every and any work win online. The universe has since intervened, ridding us of opportunities. With vast postponements and cancellations because of social distancing, there is little for most of us to be thrilled about and even less to announce. At first, many coped by mournfully listing the lost opportunities they would have announced but for the pandemic. Now, as several days have passed and lockdown is official, our social media accounts are catching up with this sudden change. We are pivoting to sharing news about our personal hobbies– knitting, bread baking and gardening – instead of side hustling. I have discovered that people I followed for years have a passion for singing that they’ve never had time to share; I am watching ex-colleagues learning to play instruments. And I’ve been able to pursue my dream of learning to sculpt. Instagram has aided this shift, releasing a Stay Home sticker to add to your posts, encouraging users to share what they are doing while isolated, such as showing followers how they are passing the time, and vice versa. These updates are less about professional point scoring and more: “PERSONAL NEWS: I’ve just made and eaten my third banana cake of the week!” Of course, that isn’t to say that home living will remain wholesome and uncompetitive: there are tangible gains to be made during this strange period. The stock market may have plunged, but coronavirus has seen the clout economy boom: three days ago, American DJ D-Nice jumped from having 200,000 followers to 1.3 million on Instagram after a livestreamed dance set that even Michelle Obama tuned into. “The Body Coach” Joe Wicks has become a household name, after conducting daily PE lessons from his living room for schoolchildren. For most of us, however, social media right now is like a low-stakes year 6 talent show, where everyone wins simply by taking part. Perhaps that is something worth taking back with us into the real world when all of this is over.', 'charCount': '2768', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false',

Take Madonna, the world-famous multi-millionaire who declared Covid-19 “the great equaliser” on Twitter and Instagram in since-deleted posts. “We are all in the same boat” she said, sitting surrounded by rose petals in a bath that, were it to be sold, the funds raised could probably see me through the looming recession. “And if the ship goes down, we’re all going down together,” she added. And yet, coronavirus is still in some small ways a leveller. Only weeks ago, I wrote of the burden of “thrilled to announce” culture – the growing pressure to publicly declare every and any work win online. The universe has since intervened, ridding us of opportunities. With vast postponements and cancellations because of social distancing, there is little for most of us to be thrilled about and even less to announce. At first, many coped by mournfully listing the lost opportunities they would have announced but for the pandemic. Now, as several days have passed and lockdown is official, our social media accounts are catching up with this sudden change. We are pivoting to sharing news about our personal hobbies– knitting, bread baking and gardening – instead of side hustling. I have discovered that people I followed for years have a passion for singing that they’ve never had time to share; I am watching ex-colleagues learning to play instruments. And I’ve been able to pursue my dream of learning to sculpt. Instagram has aided this shift, releasing a Stay Home sticker to add to your posts, encouraging users to share what they are doing while isolated, such as showing followers how they are passing the time, and vice versa. These updates are less about professional point scoring and more: “PERSONAL NEWS: I’ve just made and eaten my third banana cake of the week!” Of course, that isn’t to say that home living will remain wholesome and uncompetitive: there are tangible gains to be made during this strange period.

Up to 2,000 workers at Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) are to be asked to be available to go back in to work, with plans to have 500 people in offices at any one time, according to the BBC. The Home Office said it was adhering to Public Health England’s guidance by maintaining social distancing at passport offices and added there was no advice saying that you should only go to work if you are an “essential” or “key” worker. On a conference call on Tuesday, staff were told by the Home Office deputy scientific adviser, Rupert Shute, that 80% of people would get Covid-19 in the end. According to a leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting seen by the BBC, Shute said: “You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it. “We are working on the assessment that 80% of us, if we haven’t already, will get the virus.” He added: “We cannot hide away from it forever.” This mirrored earlier government briefings, but the position was overtaken when computer modelling suggested a lockdown would be needed to reduce infections. Myrtle Lloyd, chief operating officer at the Passport Office, was also on the call. She reportedly told staff the guidance did not mean they “should stay at home instead of delivering critical services”. “What is also critical for us as a business is to have a manageable level of work in the system, so that when we start our recovery we are not overwhelmed by our demands,” she reportedly said. Downing Street backed up the Home Office’s decision that the Passport Office was “adhering to public health advice” but appeared to contradict the view of the department’s deputy chief scientific adviser that people should not seek to hide away from the virus. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The government’s focus is on stopping the spread of the disease to protect the health service. I think you’ve heard on a daily basis from the chief scientific and medical officers they have been very, very clear on the need for people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.” He gave no view on whether the government agrees that 80% of the public will eventually contract coronavirus. The Public and Commercial Services union raised concerns about the reports, and said it had been pressing managers across the civil service to close offices so people could work from home. Its general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “It is absolutely scandalous that Her Majesty’s Passport Office are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. “The cavalier approach to our members’ health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-19. We have already had members die as a result of contracting coronavirus, and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home. “For the deputy chief scientific adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current government guidance. Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic.” A Home Office spokesman said: “Her Majesty’s Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. “It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a significant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. “It was made clear in the meeting that the government’s priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.” The Home Office added that government advice had been clear that people may travel for work purposes, if they could not work from home.",4338,false,false,"<a href=""profile/jamie-grierson"">Jamie Grierson</a> and <a href=""profile/rowena-mason"">Rowena Mason</a>",,,6,2020-04-10T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-04-09,2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,0

West Ham, who are owned by David Sullivan and David Gold, are looking to go down a different route. The club, whose full-time and part-time staff remain on full pay, have agreed to a rights issue, which is an invitation to existing shareholders to buy additional shares. Sullivan, whose 51% stake makes him the majority shareholder, has already agreed to do so. Whether the money raised rises above £30m will depend on how many accept the offer. If they decide not to take up their rights the shares will be offered elsewhere. It is understood the process will take place in May. While West Ham have no financial problems at the moment, that is likely to change if there is no prospect of their season resuming. Clubs are set to suffer serious losses of earnings and have warned players they could lose up to an estimated £1.137bn if the season does not resume. That is partly because they may have to return £750m in broadcasting money if the season is not completed. West Ham have lost money in gate receipts and broadcasting revenue. Their matches against Wolves, Newcastle, Chelsea and Tottenham were due to be shown on television. West Ham, whose accounts for the last financial year showed an expected pre-tax loss of £28.8m, would also normally be selling next year’s season-tickets now but the club shops are shut. Given that context West Ham are keen to protect themselves. They are in favour of players reducing pay through wage cuts, deferrals or a combination of both. Karren Brady, the club’s vice-chair, has criticised the Professional Footballers’ Association for standing in the way of cuts. “With no date for restarting the league, this is having severe financial implications,” Brady wrote in the Sun. “Bearing in mind the majority of the broadcast revenue goes to pay the players’ wages it is unthinkable that the PFA don’t seem to understand this.”', 'charCount': '2304', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/jacob-steinberg"">Jacob Steinberg</a>'}","[{'id': 'football/westhamunited', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'football', 'sectionName': 'Football', 'webTitle': 'West Ham United', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/football/westhamunited', 'references': []}, {'id': 'football/football', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'football', 'sectionName': 'Football', 'webTitle': 'Football', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/football', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football', 'references': []}, {'id': 'football/business', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'football', 'sectionName': 'Football', 'webTitle': 'Business', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/football/business', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/football/business', 'references': []}, {'id': 'sport/sport', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'sport', 'sectionName': 'Sport', 'webTitle': 'Sport', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/jacob-steinberg', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Jacob Steinberg', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-steinberg', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/jacob-steinberg', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Jacob Steinberg is a football reporter for the Guardian</p>', 'bylineImageUrl': 'https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/4/1425468980677/Jacob-Steinberg.jpg', 'bylineLargeImageUrl': 'https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Jacob-Steinberg,-L.png', 'firstName': 'Jacob ', 'lastName': 'Steinberg', 'twitterHandle': 'JacobSteinberg'}, {'id': 'publication/theguardian', 'type': 'publication', 'sectionId': 'theguardian', 'sectionName': 'From the Guardian', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian', 'references': [], 'description': ""All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice.""}, {'id': 'theguardian/sport', 'type': 'newspaper-book', 'sectionId': 'sport', 'sectionName': 'Sport', 'webTitle': 'Sport', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport', 'references': []}, {'id': 'theguardian/sport/news', 'type': 'newspaper-book-section', 'sectionId': 'sport', 'sectionName': 'Sport', 'webTitle': 'News & features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/sport/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/sport/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport', 'type': 'tracking', 'webTitle': 'UK Sport', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-sport', 'references': []}]",False,pillar/sport,Sport,West Ham plan £30m rights issue to cover revenue shortcomings,<ul><li>Coronavirus suspension leads to lack of income</li><li>Stock to be offered to existing shareholders first</li></ul>,West Ham have come up with a plan to tackle the financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic,Jacob Steinberg,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e5e1e49cd9ce7a790c3def517b0f5a07a363b836"">

Staff at St Mungo’s have gone on strike after a year-long dispute about the charity’s sickness policy and concern about the ratio of junior to more senior workers. Strikers are on picket lines in London, Bristol and Brighton. Union officials estimate that about 200 staff have joined the strike – the first at the charity since 2014. Workers fear the staffing policy opens the door to a cheaper workforce on worse pay and terms and conditions. They claim that the working arrangements proposed by managers will undermine safety. Staff have also expressed concern about the charity’s information sharing about migrant rough sleepers with the Home Office, a practice exposed by the Guardian. Members of Unite rejected calls from the charity’s chief executive, Howard Sinclair, to suspend the strike because of coronavirus, instead saying they are following government guidance.

Last year the charity apologised for doing this. St Mungo’s provides beds each night for 2,850 homeless people, in 120 hostels. Its annual turnover is £112m.

Individuals or corporations pay to spread risk across a large community, creating a greater degree of financial security and peace of mind, regardless of what challenges might end up materialising. In many cases it’s worked flawlessly for centuries. Businesses burned to the ground can often emerge from the ashes in a matter of months. Disability and sickness mustn’t spell certain bankruptcy. In the 18th century, the wives and children of deceased members of the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office were guaranteed cash, thanks to what’s believed to be one of the earliest examples of life insurance as we know it. The insured should be able to rely on an uncompromising safety net in the toughest of times, and yet - as we’re enduring precisely such a time - coronavirus is adding debilitating insult to unprecedented injury by exposing the shortcomings of the insurance sector: the system we’re using is not fit for the modern world, and the cost of these deficiencies could well be cataclysmic. In theory everything looked quite all right. The vast majority of companies across the UK and beyond tend to have business interruption insurance that pays when they can’t operate. A similar type of insurance, known as contingent business interruption insurance, comes into play when a critical supplier to an insured organisation can’t function. If you’re a company that makes smartphones in the US, but the Chinese factory supplying your microchips suddenly floods, you’re likely to be protected. A French luxury goods company whose Indian fabric manufacturer has been wiped out by a storm? Same thing. The problem is that in the vast majority of cases, these policies cite “direct physical loss or damage” as a requirement to be triggered. Quarantines and travel bans might make it impossible for a business to keep its doors open, but they don’t constitute obvious physical damage. So as far as the insurer’s concerned, it’s not their problem. It wasn’t always like this. In years gone by some insurers were more forgiving when it came to the prospect of paying out when disease struck, mostly because at that point major global disease was little more than a theoretical prospect. Then Sars and Ebola provided a lesson in what was actually economically viable - how far insurers can be stretched - and suddenly it became pretty clear that the parameters would have to shift. The world has become much more interconnected. Supply chains are deeply complex and travel far easier. Bugs can be spread from one side of the planet to the other in a matter of hours while infecting hundreds en route. Taking on the risk of having to foot the bill of an uncontrollable pandemic has simply become unpalatable for anyone, particularly if no one can actually say for certain what the true extent of the impact might look like. It would be like asking an insurer to sign a blank cheque. In the best case scenario, businesses are aware of this and have made alternate provisions, even if these might be painfully pricey. In the worst case though, they’re blind to the risk altogether. For smaller companies unable to hire a team of experts, understanding the nuances and caveats of what might look like a pro forma policy is an unenviable task. Ten years ago no one was stress-testing for coronavirus. So we need education. Businesses can’t afford to be caught out as is happening now. They need to be able to scan the horizon and know what could be lingering up ahead: what provisions are in place and what risk truly means. Perhaps even more urgently, though, politicians need to understand the domino effects of an inadequate insurance sector. On Monday, Boris Johnson advised the public against going to pubs, restaurants and bars. As of Tuesday night, he hadn’t issued an official order for such venues to close – and this matters. Many business owners, particularly in the hospitality industry, have expressed outrage, sparked by fears they won’t contractually be able to make insurance claims unless the government explicitly bans their venues from staying open. Some commentators accused Johnson of favouring the insurance industry, after it was revealed he was paid £25,000 to speak at an event held by the British Insurance Brokers Association (Biba) in May. (Biba has since defended the decision.) In a furious letter to the prime minister on Monday, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (and a former Tory MEP), warned of an existential crisis as a direct result of the guidance issued by the government. “Thousands of pubs and hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost in the very short term unless a proactive package creating cash and liquidity is provided immediately to the industry,” McClarkin wrote. The Association of British Insurers was quick to point out that, even if the government were to force closures, the “vast majority of firms won’t have purchased cover that will enable them to claim on their insurance to compensate for their business being closed by the coronavirus”. But it nonetheless admitted that some, typically larger, firms “might have purchased an extension to their cover for closure due to any infectious disease”. Surely if the government can relatively easily provide a swift lifeline to even a tiny number of large businesses – businesses that provide jobs and jobs that support families - then that’s a step worth taking. The hospitality sector is the UK’s third largest in terms of employment. It accounts for about 9% of this country’s jobs. According to the sector’s trade body, its economic contribution is greater than that of the automotive, pharma and aeronautics sectors combined. An awful lot is at stake here - perhaps even more than our politicians truly realise. If the support isn’t provided, we’ll face certain disaster and a bitter hangover for years to come. It’s human nature not to entertain the grimmest of ideas. We don’t like to think about the worst case scenario because it’s uncomfortable. But perhaps the lesson we’re learning here is that we have to confront the inconvenient to protect ourselves. On Tuesday the government said it would guarantee £330bn of loans to businesses struggling in the face of coronavirus. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also announced tax breaks in an effort to avert a full-blown recession. That’s to be applauded, but the shortcoming of the insurance sector is just one example of why we need a structural and sweeping rethink of the way in which the government supports business. A one-off sticking plaster just won’t do the trick. • Josie Cox is a journalist and broadcaster specialising in business, finance and gender equality",6716,false,false,"<a href=""profile/josie-cox"">Josie Cox</a>",2020-03-21T15:50:17Z,,,,,,,,2020-03-18,2020-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,0

Bubonic plague is thought to have been carried to this remote corner of Derbyshire from London back in the 1660s by infected fleas, trapped in a bale of fabric ordered to make costumes for a festival. The sickness spread fast, killing dozens of villagers and leaving many on the verge of fleeing in panic – but then something extraordinary happened. The rector of Eyam, believing it his duty to spare neighbouring towns from infection, persuaded his parishioners to take the astonishingly self-sacrificing step of sealing themselves off from the world. They would live or they would die, but nobody would leave until the sickness had burned itself out. One mother is said to have buried six of her children, yet by staying must have saved countless other women from the same fate. It’s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now. When it came to the crunch, how many of us would secretly have more in common with the local squire, who fled after the first few deaths and left his neighbours to their fate? Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren’t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good. So it’s lucky for us, then, that Covid-19 is nothing like the Black Death. Where untreated, plague killed about half of its victims. This new virus seems to have a death rate of about 2%, and medicine has thankfully come a long way in 400 years. Having been caught up in the noughties’ swine flu outbreak and suffered nothing worse than a few days sweating under a duvet, I’m certainly not inclined to panic unnecessarily about this one, but then people like me aren’t the point. It’s the elderly and infirm, people with existing lung conditions or suppressed immune systems, who may be most vulnerable, and it’s them we are being asked to protect. Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else’s problem. Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word “quarantine” sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is – like the tourists now confined to a Tenerife hotel after an Italian guest tested positive – when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don’t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don’t want to risk taking 14 days off. If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it’s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke draconian emergency powers to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital. China’s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even nailing victims’ front doors shut, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won’t translate easily to European democracies. So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization’s warning that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is closing all its schools but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when briefing MPs on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn’t worth it at this stage. The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam’s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go.

The US and Iran are already at loggerheads over the impact of US sanctions on Tehran’s ability to fight the coronavirus pandemic, and the threat of a military attack on the US is likely to widen the dispute. The Iranian army chief of staff, Mohammad Bagheri, said the recent spate of attacks on US bases in Iraq were nothing to do with Iran, but were “a natural response by the Iraqi people”. He said US forces were being closely monitored minute by minute and any US attack would produce the most severe response. Trump on Wednesday said Iran or its proxies planned a sneak attack on American targets in Iraq, prompting the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to hit back, tweeting: “Don’t be mislead [sic] by usual warmongers,” adding that “Iran has FRIENDS: No one can have MILLIONS of proxies.

The benchmark price for Brent crude dropped by more than 5% to $28 a barrel on Wednesday amid gloomy forecasts for demand during the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time US oil prices tumbled to 18-year lows of $19.20 a barrel after the quickest rise in surplus oil supplies in history. The International Energy Agency (IEA) told the market to brace for the lowest oil demand in 25 years because of the global lockdown across numerous countries and territories to contain the virus. Oil demand will this month hit its lowest levels for the year, according to the agency, falling below last year’s average by 29m barrels per day to reach levels not seen since 1995. “Even assuming that travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year, we expect that global oil demand in 2020 will fall by 9.3m barrels a day versus 2019, erasing almost a decade of growth,” the IEA said. The sharp collapse in oil demand has left the global market oversupplied with enough crude to overwhelm storage facilities in landlocked oilfields. In the US, oil inventories climbed by more than 19m barrels in the last week, the biggest one-week increase in history. The fresh price falls come days after the world’s largest oil producers within the Opec cartel agreed with its allies and other G20 countries to cut up to 20m barrels a day fromproduction from next month. The IEA said there was “no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset” the impact of the virus on global oil demand but added that the plan was a “solid start”. The IEA’s warning emerged hours after the International Monetary Fund predicted the deepest recession since the Great Depression because of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. The latest IEA report says the oil market is at its darkest moment in what will be a historic year for the industry because of the unprecedented global lockdown. Over the second quarter of the year, demand for oil will fall 23.1m barrels a day below 2019 levels, before a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. By December, oil demand will be 2.7m barrels a day lower than at the end of last year. Data commissioned by the Guardian this month shows that the coronavirus is likely to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system and erase 2.5bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel industry. This would be the biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined. The IEA’s findings underline fears among oil traders that the deal hammered out between Opec and its allies over the Easter weekend would prove “too little, too late” to prevent further oil price falls. The plunging oil market price has forced oil rigs producing more than a million barrels a day to shut and wiped billions from the market value of the world’s biggest oil companies. On Wednesday morning, shares in Royal Dutch Shell fell by almost 5% to £1,348p, while BP shares fell by 5.5% to 303.35p.', 'charCount': '3274', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false',

The benchmark price for Brent crude dropped by more than 5% to $28 a barrel on Wednesday amid gloomy forecasts for demand during the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time US oil prices tumbled to 18-year lows of $19.20 a barrel after the quickest rise in surplus oil supplies in history. The International Energy Agency (IEA) told the market to brace for the lowest oil demand in 25 years because of the global lockdown across numerous countries and territories to contain the virus. Oil demand will this month hit its lowest levels for the year, according to the agency, falling below last year’s average by 29m barrels per day to reach levels not seen since 1995. “Even assuming that travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year, we expect that global oil demand in 2020 will fall by 9.3m barrels a day versus 2019, erasing almost a decade of growth,” the IEA said. The sharp collapse in oil demand has left the global market oversupplied with enough crude to overwhelm storage facilities in landlocked oilfields. In the US, oil inventories climbed by more than 19m barrels in the last week, the biggest one-week increase in history. The fresh price falls come days after the world’s largest oil producers within the Opec cartel agreed with its allies and other G20 countries to cut up to 20m barrels a day fromproduction from next month. The IEA said there was “no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset” the impact of the virus on global oil demand but added that the plan was a “solid start”. The IEA’s warning emerged hours after the International Monetary Fund predicted the deepest recession since the Great Depression because of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. The latest IEA report says the oil market is at its darkest moment in what will be a historic year for the industry because of the unprecedented global lockdown. Over the second quarter of the year, demand for oil will fall 23.1m barrels a day below 2019 levels, before a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. By December, oil demand will be 2.7m barrels a day lower than at the end of last year. Data commissioned by the Guardian this month shows that the coronavirus is likely to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system and erase 2.5bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the fossil fuel industry. This would be the biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined. The IEA’s findings underline fears among oil traders that the deal hammered out between Opec and its allies over the Easter weekend would prove “too little, too late” to prevent further oil price falls. The plunging oil market price has forced oil rigs producing more than a million barrels a day to shut and wiped billions from the market value of the world’s biggest oil companies. On Wednesday morning, shares in Royal Dutch Shell fell by almost 5% to £1,348p, while BP shares fell by 5.5% to 303.35p.",3274,false,false,"<a href=""profile/jillian-ambrose"">Jillian Ambrose</a> Energy correspondent",,,29,2020-04-16T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-04-15,2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,0

Emmanuel Macron announced the new rules during a visit to Chamonix on Thursday when he visited the famous Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice) glacier, which has shrunk dramatically over the last 20 years. “What we see with this glacier melting is irrefutable evidence of global warming,” Macron said after visiting the 4.7-mile (7.5km) glacier. He said the fight for biodiversity was urgent and a “fight for our own survival”. “It’s the battle of the century,” Macron said. He announced a new agency, the French Office of Biodiversity (OFB), to monitor and protect the environment. The French government is to establish a protected zone around Mont Blanc and limit the number of people who can access the summit, which at just over 4,800 metres is the highest in western Europe. Climbers will also be asked for proof they have planned their ascent, that they have reserved places at reservations en route and are carrying specified equipment. Macron’s visit came after Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of Saint Gervais – near Contamines-Montjoie, where a coronavirus outbreak was reported last week – wrote to the Elysée claiming the free-for-all on the mountain was risking lives and damaging the environment. “It is all well and good to worry about the Amazon rainforest, but to ignore what is happening on Mont Blanc and to allow this disrespect to continue is intolerable,” Peillex wrote last September. He said “oddballs” were polluting the mountain, citing a recent attempt by a former British Royal Marine to summit Mont Blanc for charity while carrying a full-sized rowing machine, which he abandoned on the path down. As many as 30,000 people attempt to climb Mont Blanc every year – around 200-300 a day. Some ignore weather and safety warnings and many leave rubbish on the mountain. Peillex continued: “The difficulty is that if we start listing everyone’s madcap schemes then we’ll finish up with an endless list.

Though its final reprise ends, as Kretzmer notes, “with the words ‘When tomorrow comes’ – because I truly believe that hope can never be extinguished”.",4556,false,true,"<a href=""profile/david-jays"">David Jays</a>",,,,,,,,,2020-02-13,2020-02-13 00:00:00+00:00,0

So refreshing compared to the desperate May v Corbyn PMQs! zambooka ‘Starmer should have attacked harder’ Starmer was ‘fine’ at PMQs and Johnson was completely floundering, but Starmer should honestly have attacked harder.

Bolsonaro, notorious for racist remarks about indigenous people and a nationalist argument in favour of developing the Amazon, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers.

Grabbing land on federal reserves by deforesting it, burning the dead trees and putting cattle on it to consolidate possession is common practice in the Amazon. “The measure permits titling public areas which were illegally deforested with the objective of obtaining the land,” said Imazon, a non-profit environmentalist group.

Key environment officials have been sacked, and environmentalists and indigenous leaders fear the pandemic is being used as a smokescreen for a new assault on the rainforest. They say a presidential decree awaiting congressional approval and new rules at the indigenous agency Funai effectively legalise land grabbing in protected forests and indigenous reserves. “The indigenous peoples are alone and we have to fight against the virus, the loggers and the wildcat miners. We don’t know which is worse,” said Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous leader from Pará state. Bolsonaro, notorious for racist remarks about indigenous people and a nationalist argument in favour of developing the Amazon, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers. He said the Yanomami indigenous reserve – Brazil’s largest – was too big and attacked environment agencies for fining people for environmental crimes. In December 2019 he issued a decree known as MP910, allowing farmers squatting up to 2,500 hectares within government-controlled reserves to legalise it. A previous law in 2017 allowed this for land squatted until 2011; Bolsonaro’s decree extended it until 2018. Critics called it the “land grabbers decree”. Grabbing land on federal reserves by deforesting it, burning the dead trees and putting cattle on it to consolidate possession is common practice in the Amazon. “The measure permits titling public areas which were illegally deforested with the objective of obtaining the land,” said Imazon, a non-profit environmentalist group. Federal prosecutors said it would further facilitate land grabbing, in a detailed analysis. The decree has until 19 May to be approved by Congress. Lawmakers from the agricultural lobby are pushing for a vote before then, in the midst of the pandemic, after proposing changes that will effectively make it even easier and cheaper to legalise squatted land – even if the landowner seeking title has already received a land title under “agrarian reform” schemes and sold it on. On 22 April, Funai published a new rule to allow land grabbers on indigenous reserves to regularise their land, provided the reserve has not completed the lengthy demarcation process. That process can take decades to complete and requires presidential approval – and Bolsonaro has vowed not to demarcate “one centimetre” more of indigenous land. The Funai employees’ association said the new rule “turns Funai into a real-estate notary for squatters, land grabbers and land developers in indigenous lands”. The National Council of Human Rights, an independent federal body, called for the rule be revoked, noting that 237 indigenous reserves had yet to complete the demarcation process and another six were “restricted use” areas with reports of isolated groups who have no immunity to common diseases such as the flu, never mind Covid-19. Landgrabbers could now claim title in all of these. In a rare move, 49 federal prosecutors across Brazil called for the Funai rule to be annulled for its “unconstitutionality, unconventionality and illegality”. Daniel Azevedo, one of the prosecutors involved, said it encouraged land grabbers who would expect similar decrees to follow. “The Amazon works like a stock market. What those in power in the country say really influences people’s behaviour,” he said. “This passes on a message that if you deforest now in 2020 or 2021, you will soon become owner of this area,” he added. “The tendency is the forest will be heavily devastated in the next few years.” Those defending titles for land grabbers argue they will help regularise the Amazon’s chaotic land ownership situation. Allowing farmers to title land they squatted in the past lets them access credit and improve productivity, reducing their need to expand further into the forest, farmers argue. Senator Irajá Abreu, who is guiding MP910 through Congress, told the Congress in Focus site that the land grabbers decree was a “good law for 99% of Brazilian families, for Brazilian producers, for people who create jobs”. Funai said its new rule would “correct unconstitutionalities detected in studies carried out”.

Over five days and 40 video sessions, 10 negotiating teams were expected to provide an urgent “refocus” before the 30 June deadline for both sides to formally agree to extend the transition period if the UK asks for one. Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead negotiator, will host a press conference at noon on Friday in Brussels to give updates, but his team were told on Monday that Boris Johnson was not budging on the issue of the extensions. Barnier’s opposite number, David Frost, opened the first plenary session by “reiterating the government wish not to extend the transition period and that the job could be done by the end of the year”. Some observers said the UK government’s position that an extension is not necessary was astonishing given the depth of the coronavirus crisis. Philip Rycroft, a former chief civil servant at the now defunct Brexit department, told Prospect magazine: “It is simple common sense to ask for an extension of the transition period.” Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank, believes an extension is inevitable but Johnson has “no incentive” to seek one until June, the deadline for a one-off UK request. “A free-trade agreement could still be agreed but it would be hard to implement. Even if we were coming to the end of this pandemic by then, businesses will be not be prepared,” said Lowe, who described himself as optimistic that a free-trade deal could be done by the end of the year, albeit a poor one. This week’s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January. Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered. Joint committee Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees. Those committees cover the Northern Ireland protocol; citizens’ rights; British sovereign army bases in Cyprus, the divorce bill, Gibraltar and “other separation issues”. Who is on the committees, how often they will meet and precisely what they will be exploring has yet to be disclosed. Northern Ireland checks The Ireland Northern Ireland specialised committee (INISC) will meet for the first time on 30 April. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that the INISC will be “comprised of official-level representatives of the EU and the UK” and will “meet as regularly as required to facilitate engagement between the UK and the EU on protocol implementation”. A working group will also be set up to feed into the committee. TheCabinet Office says it will act “as a forum for the exchange of information and mutual consultation” on implementation. So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group. The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled. Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission’s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive’s director general of international relations. One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where. Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods “at risk” of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland. Border inspection posts The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland. Fisheries This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June. The chances of progress in this week’s talks have been hampered by the failure of the UK to issue a legal text giving detail to how it envisages its new status as an independent coastal state to work. The EU issued text for all areas but the UK issued a partial text. “This means the text the negotiating teams will be discussing is the EU’s text, not the UK’s,” a source said. Customs Gove told parliament as recently as February that the UK needed an army of 50,000 customs agents to deal with cross-border trade from January 2021. It seem unlikely much progress has been made here. Immigration The immigration bill, which would have closed the borders to low-paid unskilled workers from January, has been shelved, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced this week.

The economic and regulatory kinship was strengthened by the transformation of Britain’s quaint and mercantile financial sector into a replica of the US’s aggressive markets. The City caught up with Wall Street. An interventionist foreign policy – publicly moralistic but privately cynical – gave the model an expansionist edge, which helped both nations project power abroad and defend their own financial and political interests. But the wars led to quagmires, and the rapidly expanding financial sectors to economic near-death experiences. Neither triggered significant rethinking or reflection. After the 2008 financial crisis, when this system came within “48 hours” of the “apocalypse”, two centre-left leaders, Barack Obama and Gordon Brown, chose to shore up the infrastructure that had brought their economies to the brink, recapitalising the banks and revitalising the markets, opting for more regulation rather than fundamental reform. Just as the financial crash was treated as the malfunctioning of a particular unsupervised bug in the system rather than as a feature of it, so is the failure to grapple with the pandemic being cast as an unforeseen, exogenous event, rather than a result of an ideology that enables the state to scramble unprecedented resources to save banks but not lives. A nurse will wear a bin liner as PPE in the US for longer than a failing bank can go unfinanced. Hollow triumphalism about making America great again and Britain taking back control becomes more and more likely in such a system. Trump and the Tories alighted on this formula not entirely out of mendacity or ideology. Without radically challenging Anglo-American capitalism, they have nothing else to offer their voters. And so they must separate economic suffering from politics, and attempt to blame it on immigrants and outsiders. They must blame other countries and international institutions – the EU, WHO, Nato – for the feelings of helplessness experienced by their own citizens. The swagger is a facade. Behind it hides a rotting national landscape. As the bodies pile up, the failure of the US and the UK will be somehow spun into victory. The triumphalism will intensify; that is certain. The only question now is how many will continue to believe it. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",5987,false,false,"<a href=""profile/nesrinemalik"">Nesrine Malik</a>",,,3,2020-05-11T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-05-10,2020-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,0

Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel’s daytime schedules – a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/tv-presenter-steph-mcgovern-how-i-eat"">Steph McGovern</a>, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel’s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened.</p> <p>“I’m just at Asda,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “I had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.” She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she’s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house.</p> <p>In what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern’s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""eec92d3e592819d41793789662db9b0d8066db5b""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/eec92d3e592819d41793789662db9b0d8066db5b/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg"" alt=""Producer’s eye view ... multiple camera views of the Steph Show in progress around McGovern’s house."" width=""1000"" height=""563"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Producer’s eye view ... multiple camera views of the Steph Show in progress around McGovern’s house.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we’re all in it together,” McGovern says. “I mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,” she adds ruefully.</p> <p>Incredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown.

Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel’s daytime schedules – a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star Steph McGovern, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel’s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened. “I’m just at Asda,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “I had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.” She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she’s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house. In what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern’s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired. “It was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we’re all in it together,” McGovern says. “I mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,” she adds ruefully. Incredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown. Last week, she attempted a cookery segment, with the Cold Feet star Fay Ripley bravely attempting to instruct her remotely on how to make mac and cheese. McGovern botched it, but kept returning to the dish to grab a mouthful over the course of the next few minutes, the same way you or I might.

Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel’s daytime schedules – a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star Steph McGovern, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel’s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened. “I’m just at Asda,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “I had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.” She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she’s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house. In what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern’s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired. “It was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we’re all in it together,” McGovern says. “I mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,” she adds ruefully. Incredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown. Last week, she attempted a cookery segment, with the Cold Feet star Fay Ripley bravely attempting to instruct her remotely on how to make mac and cheese. McGovern botched it, but kept returning to the dish to grab a mouthful over the course of the next few minutes, the same way you or I might. For anyone stuck by themselves at the moment, it must feel like dropping in on an old friend. “That’s exactly how we wanted it to feel”, says Channel 4’s head of daytime, Jo Street, whose decision it was to bring the series forward. “Steph does feel like an everywoman. She’s the girl you want to have a beer with, or go for a coffee with, or be mates with. For a massive part of our audience, that is the job that she’s doing every lunchtime.” Indeed, it’s hard to see how this would work had anyone else been in the driving seat. If a big name had presented a daytime show from their imposingly large house, viewers would have been instantly alienated. But McGovern’s house, although beautifully designed – her integrated kitchen banquette has already become something of a national talking point – is basically a normal-sized family house. The living room, dining room and kitchen are all essentially the same thing, and you could probably walk from one end to the other in less than 10 seconds. Her partner and baby have to hide in a bedroom during the broadcast. McGovern says that her daughter “tends to sleep through the show. That’s how much she cares about it.” The main thing, she’s finding, is locating the balance between family home and television studio. “Keeping it tidy is the big thing,” McGovern says. “A lot of viewers have said to me: ‘How come your house is so clean?’ I’m like: ‘Because it’s on telly.’ I’ve got a bit of a routine of an evening. We have our dinner and then, once everyone goes to bed, I just whizz around and try and sort it out. We have a deal. My partner does the cooking and I do all the tidying.” And yet, despite all this, there’s more to McGovern than her everywoman persona would suggest. Before being poached by Channel 4, she had been BBC Breakfast’s lead business presenter for a decade. Before that she was a producer, in charge of the business news for the BBC’s one, six and 10 o’clock bulletins. At the age of 19, during an apprenticeship with Black &amp; Decker, she devised a new production technique that saved the company £150,000 a year. When Have I Got News For You decided to continue filming remotely without an audience, she was the first choice to host. In short, she knows her stuff. And this extends to her plans for the direction of The Steph Show. “I’ve learned that I want real people to be the focus of it, and that’s what I want to keep driving through,” she says. “Yes, it’s lovely to have some celebrities on, but, for me, what’s better are people like the blood biker volunteers we had on yesterday. Or the 14-year-old girl who lost her hands when she was a baby and can now play piano because she learned it in lockdown. I know it sounds cheesy, but that’s what I think is going to make this show good.” “Public service broadcasting is not just news and current affairs,” adds Street. “It’s about connecting to an audience when they need you. Steph was really passionate about that.” It all sounds lovely, but these are uncertain times. Without wanting to get any darker than necessary, I have to ask McGovern about contingencies. Her show is called The Steph Show. It’s filmed from her house. Hopefully it won’t, but what would happen if she finds herself becoming ill? “We’ll have to see if Stephanie Cole is available,” she shrugs. “Do you know what? Nobody has an answer to that. I have not got a clue what we would do. If I wasn’t too ill, then I would like to think I would try to carry on in some capacity. If I got really ill, someone else could do it. I’m not precious about it. Johnny Vegas seems to be appearing a lot. I might ask him if he could.” So successful is The Steph Show in this new form, in fact, that I wonder whether this is perhaps how it should always be. Broadcasting from her home gives the show such a ramshackle and intimate quality that it already feels as if the show’s voice has been found. Has anyone considered abandoning the studio and carrying on like this after the lockdown lifts? “Yes. Sure,” scolds Jo Street, sarcastically. “Because this is such an easy way to make a television programme.” McGovern also admits that continuing like this for ever is her “biggest fear”, but then adds that the current set-up is bound to inform the show when it is broadcast as intended. “Or maybe I could just recreate my entire house inside the studio,” she ponders. “I might just go full-on Alan Partridge.” • The Steph Show, weekdays, 12pm, Channel 4",6618,false,false,"<a href=""profile/stuart-heritage"">Stuart Heritage</a>",,,,,,,,,2020-04-16,2020-04-16 00:00:00+00:00,0

This involved walking up and down while a bitter chemical was sprayed to ensure there were no leaks in this suffocating face-covering. These masks are in short supply internationally, yet I’ve seen celebrities posing for selfies wearing them. Two weeks down the line and I am well into the routine of donning and doffing my personal protective equipment. As a doctor working in intensive care, I am fortunate to be provided with a surgical cap, goggles, mask, long-sleeved gowns, two pairs of gloves and an apron. However, we hear from many people across the UK who are still waiting for theirs.

Speaking before the first tranche of top appointments, the new Labour leader promised he would create a shadow cabinet balanced between the various wings of the party. However, MPs still loyal to Jeremy Corbyn will note there was no immediate role for Rebecca Long-Bailey, the former leader’s perceived favourite in the leadership race, and no senior job yet for other figures associated with his camp. Starmer’s top team was completed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, who takes over from Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary. Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team. Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister. Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader. Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery were confirmed as having left the shadow cabinet, having served as shadow international trade secretary, shadow Cabinet Office minister and party chair respectively. Trickett tweeted to say Starmer had “politely asked me to stand down”. Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday. Nandy’s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post. While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands. Nandy’s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must “change or die”. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values. In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: “It’s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour’s foreign policy response in these difficult times.” Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to “act in the country’s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods” during the coronavirus pandemic. “We will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,” he said. Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be “balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country – and of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity”. Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels. “I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.” In his first media interview since winning the leadership, Starmer sought to stress party unity but made it plain he believed that Labour needed significant change. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.” Playing down the idea of some form of national unity government, Starmer pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to coronavirus while asking “difficult questions” when needed. But he stressed the need for an equitable economic settlement once the crisis was over, saying there would be a need for richer people and corporations to pay more tax, rather than a return to austerity. “What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change.

Speaking before the first tranche of top appointments, the new Labour leader promised he would create a shadow cabinet balanced between the various wings of the party. However, MPs still loyal to Jeremy Corbyn will note there was no immediate role for Rebecca Long-Bailey, the former leader’s perceived favourite in the leadership race, and no senior job yet for other figures associated with his camp. Starmer’s top team was completed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, who takes over from Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary. Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team. Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister. Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader. Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery were confirmed as having left the shadow cabinet, having served as shadow international trade secretary, shadow Cabinet Office minister and party chair respectively. Trickett tweeted to say Starmer had “politely asked me to stand down”. Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday. Nandy’s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post. While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands. Nandy’s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must “change or die”. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values. In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: “It’s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour’s foreign policy response in these difficult times.” Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to “act in the country’s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods” during the coronavirus pandemic. “We will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,” he said. Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be “balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country – and of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity”. Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels. “I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.” In his first media interview since winning the leadership, Starmer sought to stress party unity but made it plain he believed that Labour needed significant change. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.” Playing down the idea of some form of national unity government, Starmer pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to coronavirus while asking “difficult questions” when needed. But he stressed the need for an equitable economic settlement once the crisis was over, saying there would be a need for richer people and corporations to pay more tax, rather than a return to austerity. “What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change.

The number of coronavirus-related deaths increased by 40 overnight, with authorities reporting 4,785 new cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 36,793. Moscow, which became the centre of Russia’s coronavirus outbreak and was also the first region in the country to introduce a lockdown, recorded 2,649 new cases and 21 deaths, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said. Extra PPE to be delivered to Scottish care homes amid supply concerns Extra supplies of personal protective equipment will be delivered directly to more than 1,000 care homes in Scotland, as concerns about the supply and quality of PPE continue. While the care sector usually sources its own PPE, the pandemic has put extreme pressure on supply chains with concerns raised earlier this week that some manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to Scotland. The Scottish government announced overnight that NHS National Services Scotland would prioritise the delivery of stock directly to care homes where the virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local hubs which supply PPE to other care workers. Trump administration accused of dereliction of duty over testing failure Donald Trump’s administration has been accused of a dereliction of duty by a senator over its failure to rapidly expand coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, vented his frustration in a phone call with the vice-president, Mike Pence, on Friday, according to reports. “I have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,” King reportedly said during the conversation. Iran’s coronavirus death toll hits 5,000 Iran’s official Covid-19 death toll has topped 5,000. In the last 24 hours, there have been 73 new coronavirus deaths, bringing the country’s total to 5,031, the health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour told state TV. The daily death toll was one of the lowest in recent days, he said, adding that the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country had reached 80,868. According to a parliamentary report released earlier this week, the coronavirus death toll might be almost double the figure announced by the health ministry, and the number of infections eight to 10 times higher. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East, with one of the world’s highest coronavirus-related death tolls. Hundreds of Taiwanese navy sailors quarantined About 700 Taiwanese navy sailors are being put in quarantine after three Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a goodwill mission to the Pacific island state of Palau, the country’s government has announced. Three Taiwan navy vessels visited Palau – an archipelago of islands which was under US administration until its independence in 1994 and is one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan – in the middle of March and returned to Taiwan a month later, Chen Shih-chung, the health minister, said.', 'charCount': '3191', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/simon-murphy"">Simon Murphy</a>'}","[{'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/series/coronavirus-at-a-glance', 'type': 'series', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus: at a glance', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-at-a-glance', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/series/coronavirus-at-a-glance', 'references': [], 'description': '<p>Regular summaries of the biggest developments in the&nbsp;global coronavirus outbreak. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live"">Click here for latest news updates</a><br></p>'}, {'id': 'world/world', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'World news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/world', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/simon-murphy', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Simon Murphy', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/simon-murphy', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Simon Murphy is a Guardian news reporter.

The number of coronavirus-related deaths increased by 40 overnight, with authorities reporting 4,785 new cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 36,793. Moscow, which became the centre of Russia’s coronavirus outbreak and was also the first region in the country to introduce a lockdown, recorded 2,649 new cases and 21 deaths, the Russian coronavirus crisis response centre said. Extra PPE to be delivered to Scottish care homes amid supply concerns Extra supplies of personal protective equipment will be delivered directly to more than 1,000 care homes in Scotland, as concerns about the supply and quality of PPE continue. While the care sector usually sources its own PPE, the pandemic has put extreme pressure on supply chains with concerns raised earlier this week that some manufacturers did not have capacity to deliver to Scotland. The Scottish government announced overnight that NHS National Services Scotland would prioritise the delivery of stock directly to care homes where the virus is known to be present, although stock would still be provided to local hubs which supply PPE to other care workers. Trump administration accused of dereliction of duty over testing failure Donald Trump’s administration has been accused of a dereliction of duty by a senator over its failure to rapidly expand coronavirus testing. Angus King, the independent senator for Maine, vented his frustration in a phone call with the vice-president, Mike Pence, on Friday, according to reports. “I have never been so mad about a phone call in my life,” King reportedly said during the conversation. Iran’s coronavirus death toll hits 5,000 Iran’s official Covid-19 death toll has topped 5,000. In the last 24 hours, there have been 73 new coronavirus deaths, bringing the country’s total to 5,031, the health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour told state TV.

JD confirmed that it had not paid the quarterly rent, which was due last week, for its 390 UK stores. The retailer is understood to be in discussions with its landlords about the next bill, due in June. Last week, the value fashion chain Primark refused to pay £33m in rent after the closure of its UK stores due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M is also pushing for waivers on its rent and service charge bill. The sportswear giant’s stores in the UK, mainland Europe and the US all shut last week. In an update to investors, it warned the shutdown would have a “significant impact” on its financial outlook. JD Sports has been one of the industry’s biggest success stories of recent years. It was promoted to the FTSE 100 in 2019 as it rode the success of the “athleisure” boom which has turned trainers and hoodies into big business.

Last week Greece’s highest court, the Council of State, also weighed in, adjudicating that in future, structures in the area must be 21 metres or less. The judgment came after the court revoked building permission for an even larger hotel due to go up in Makriyianni, with three underground parking lots and a pool garden on top. “Both decisions are a huge victory, testimony to the strength of civil society and what people can do when they unite,” said Andreas Papapetropoulos, the lawyer representing the campaigners. “We are lucky that the tribunal convened under Katerina Sakellaropoulou,” he added, referring to the environmentally sensitive high court justice who has since become Greece’s first female head of state. Construction of multistorey hotels at the base of the site will, critics argue, create the effect of “a wall of high rises” encircling the Acropolis. “Makriyianni is a residential neighbourhood. It was never meant for buildings of such dimensions,” said Frezadou. “The mass tourism we have witnessed may have disappeared with coronavirus, but it will be back. And if it goes unchecked it will destroy the very monument visitors have come for, the Acropolis itself.” But Greece’s culture minister also acknowledged the ruling had been a “very difficult decision”, saying the hotel’s proprietors “very likely” had justice on their side – even if KAS had not formally endorsed construction after the discovery of antiquities on the site. In 2012, in the midst of Greece’s economic crisis, a new construction code was passed permitting bigger and taller buildings if they met “green” standards. Investors seized the opportunity, initiating a building spree in a capital that would subsequently attract record tourist arrivals. “A lot of questions will be asked,” said Giannis Mihail, vice president of the conservation group Elliniki Etairia. An urban planner, Mihail drafted the land use laws credited with protecting Plaka, the ancient district of narrow lanes and neoclassical houses north of the Acropolis. “From the Acropolis hill Plaka looks much the same as it did in the time of Pericles. That cannot be said of Makriyianni, on the south side of the monument, because land use laws were never extended to the entire urban area surrounding the site.” Bakoyannis, like the campaigners, believes no view should be the preserve of a privileged few. Athens, he says, stands out from other cities precisely because the Acropolis – undergoing a mini facelift ahead of reopening on 18 May – can be seen far and wide. “In London there’s Big Ben but you can only see it from certain, richer areas. The same goes for Paris and the Eiffel Tower. But the Acropolis has a unifying character. You can see it from all around Athens, whether you live in a poor neighbourhood or a rich neighbourhood,” he told the Guardian. But the mayor also cautioned against heaping blame on businessmen. Greece’s fragile economy is set to contract by as much as 10% as a result of the pandemic, with investment crucial to any recovery. He added: “It’s easy to say this bad hotel owner or that bad investor but we also need to be very clear about the rules we set, respect the decisions of our high court and create a predictable and safe business environment.” How or when the owners of the hotel will be called to demolish the upper floors has yet to be revealed. So far they have not reacted publicly to the KAS decision, and when asked to comment, declined. Locals have scrambled to find the money to cover legal costs. Many grumble they are doing what the state should have done long ago. But Frezadou and her fellow activists see it as a duty to keep on going: international investors are lining up, fuelling fears of runaway greed transforming the area forever. “Our battle is not yet over,” she said. “This campaign is not against one, but every, ten-storey monster in the shadow of this glorious site.”",6437,false,false,"<a href=""profile/helenasmith"">Helena Smith</a> in Athens",,,27,2020-05-11T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-05-11,2020-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,0

In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister said he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen but he got through his ordeal with “terrible buoyancy” that left him convinced he could make it. He also admitted he had worked throughout the early stage of his illness and not taken the disease seriously enough, having to be “forced” to go to hospital on the advice of doctors. Johnson came out of a three-night stay in intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in Westminster on 9 April. In a separate interview with Monday’s Sun, Johnson also revealed how he clapped for carers from his hospital ward. He told the Sun: “It was a Thursday when I came out of ICU, and with me I had a nurse called Becky and a nurse called, I think, Angel. I was just in my boxers, nothing else. We stood up and there was this big window looking out of the Thames, and we saw the Met and the Fire Brigade do this display with their boats. It was just fantastic. And we clapped like crazy for the NHS and for care workers.” Johnson added: “I owe my life to our doctors and nurses and the healthcare workers. They pulled my chestnuts out of the fire, no question.” Following his release from hospital he spent two weeks recovering at Chequers. His baby with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, was born on Wednesday morning. The PM had only returned to work on Monday. He told the Sun on Sunday: “To be honest, the doctors had all sorts of plans for what to do if things went badly wrong. I was not in particularly brilliant shape because the oxygen levels in my blood kept going down. “But it was thanks to some wonderful, wonderful nursing that I made it. They really did it and they made a huge difference.” Johnson, 55, tested positive for the virus in late March and went into isolation at a flat in 11 Downing Street for an initial period of seven days, separated from Symonds. The public were told he had persistent symptoms, including a temperature. He said: “The thing was, I was in denial because I was working and I kept doing these meetings by video link. But I was really feeling pretty groggy, to be totally honest with you. I was feeling pretty wasted – not in an intoxicated way, but just, you know, pretty rough.” By the time he ended up in hospital he explained how he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen, which was delivered by a tube fitted under his nose. That was then switched to a large face mask and, when his condition worsened, he was moved into intensive care, with doctors having to decide whether to put him into an induced coma and on to a ventilator. He said: “I was fully conscious and all too aware of what was going on. The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. “They were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally. It was a tough old moment. I won’t deny it.” He thanked the medical team that helped him, including the nursing staff Jenny McGee and Luis Pitarma, whom he first praised in a social media clip he released after his stay in hospital. Two doctors that treated him, Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart, were the inspiration for his new son Wilfred’s middle name, Nicholas, Symonds said on Saturday. In the Instagram post including a picture of Symonds holding Wilfred, she wrote that she “couldn’t be happier” and that her “heart is full”. She added: “Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am. “Wilfred after Boris’s grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’s life last month. “Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well.

My boyfriend usually calls me on the dot of 5.30, and during these unusual times, I crave this daily check-in. The thing is, I can’t call him. Leo is married and in lockdown with his wife and two children. It was hard enough being a mistress (a terrible 17th-century word, but nothing else quite fits) in “peace time”, but Covid-19 has given our relationship a whole new dimension.</p> <p>Leo and I are both writers. We met at a literary festival last June. I am 51, a newly divorced Londoner, with a daughter at university. Leo is 49 and lives near Manchester. I knew from the outset that he was married: he wasn’t wearing a ring, but one of our first conversations was about family holidays. I wouldn’t say it was love at first sight, but he was funny and clever. Nice-looking, yes, but it was more his personality that attracted me; he radiated humorous warmth.</p> <p>Knowing and respecting the rules (married men are off limits), I said goodbye to Leo and got into my car. But two days later, I was pleased to receive a Facebook message. Witty texts led to WhatsApp and, finally, a phone call. Soon we were speaking twice a day, often for hours – his wife has a corporate office job, Leo works from home – and he wanted to meet again. I put him off a few times, but we both knew it was going to happen eventually.</p> <p>In November, we had a passionate reunion in London. Yes, we had sex – the first time I had slept with anyone since the end of my marriage. My nervousness soon evaporated and it was lovely. Mostly, we laughed and talked.</p> <p>Leo never says anything negative about his wife. He insists she is “a good person”, but they have been together since they were 16 and complacency has set in. He feels taken for granted, and they are no longer physically intimate. Any concerns that he wanted me just for sex soon dissolved. Leo is an attractive and successful writer; if he was after a fling, he could have found one nearer his own part of the country, surely. I don’t feel great about adultery. It isn’t sisterly – and Leo’s wife sounds nice. On the other hand, I don’t feel guilty. I haven’t met her, and he says she has repeatedly ignored his requests to go to couples therapy.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>What would you do if you met the partner of your dreams languishing in a marriage past its shelf life?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In winter and early spring, Leo and I enjoyed several rendezvous, weekends away, even four days in France. When we knew coronavirus was coming to the UK, we sneaked in a last tryst in the Lake District. It was very intense, very loving.</p> <p>We have talked several times about the future. Leo is the main carer for his teenage children, and from the start told me they were his priority. So we are planning a life together after his younger child leaves home, in about four years’ time. This makes me respect and love him more. I can wait: I am busy with work, friends, my daughter. I know some people will roll their eyes, but Leo tells me his marriage is over and I have chosen to believe him. To critics, I would say: what would you do if you met the partner of your dreams, languishing in a marriage past its shelf life?</p> <p>These days, the only time we can talk on the phone is when Leo goes for a run – and there is a limit to the number of runs a person is allowed. But these daily conversations are a lifeline. He will stop somewhere quiet, panting from the exercise. After four weeks in lockdown, Leo tells me his relationship with his wife has deteriorated further. (I don’t take pleasure in this.) She is, understandably, anxious and needy. The kids have cabin fever. He is the chef and chief “cheerer-upper”, but this has become wearing.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""8d503499fd1565407d513fb13590696f58b186be""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/8d503499fd1565407d513fb13590696f58b186be/0_128_2362_2234/1000.jpg"" alt=""‘He will stop somewhere quiet to talk to me in the street.’"" width=""1000"" height=""946"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘He will stop somewhere quiet to talk to me in the street.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less burdened with family responsibility, I try to make him laugh, and it isn’t long before he makes me laugh, too. There is less intimacy (he is calling on a suburban street, after all). Instead we show our love through psychological support and fantasies about our eventual reunion. As for the virus, Leo is a healthy man in his late 40s. But I do worry; if he became ill, I have no idea how I would find out – except from the radio silence. I don’t know his landline number or his address; I have met only one of his male friends. If the <em>very</em> worst happened, I would be that mysterious woman you see in the movies, lurking at the back of a graveyard with big sunglasses and a black trenchcoat. (This is what happens when a person with an overactive imagination goes into lockdown.)</p> <p>The toughest thing is the sense of powerlessness that comes with most of our communication flowing only one way. Anxiety aside, I am an impatient person who doesn’t enjoy waiting. Today, when Leo finally calls just before 6pm, any irritation evaporates – partly in relief, partly in empathy.</p> <p>The question is: do I want to keep putting myself through this? And who knows how things will be when we get back to normal. My philosophy is this: if things don’t work out between us, I will be very upset, but not destroyed. My corona affair has taught me that I can love again after a horrible marriage breakup – and be loved again in return.</p> <p><strong>• </strong>Names and details have been changed.</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '25', 'wordcount': '918', 'commentable': 'false', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-04-18T06:00:02Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-05-11T10:21:11Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-04-18T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dthj2', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa6612c815f8a99630d43e372f01b57b382c141/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'sensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'It’s 5.41pm, and I am worried.

It isn’t sisterly – and Leo’s wife sounds nice. On the other hand, I don’t feel guilty. I haven’t met her, and he says she has repeatedly ignored his requests to go to couples therapy. In winter and early spring, Leo and I enjoyed several rendezvous, weekends away, even four days in France. When we knew coronavirus was coming to the UK, we sneaked in a last tryst in the Lake District. It was very intense, very loving. We have talked several times about the future. Leo is the main carer for his teenage children, and from the start told me they were his priority. So we are planning a life together after his younger child leaves home, in about four years’ time. This makes me respect and love him more. I can wait: I am busy with work, friends, my daughter. I know some people will roll their eyes, but Leo tells me his marriage is over and I have chosen to believe him. To critics, I would say: what would you do if you met the partner of your dreams, languishing in a marriage past its shelf life? These days, the only time we can talk on the phone is when Leo goes for a run – and there is a limit to the number of runs a person is allowed. But these daily conversations are a lifeline. He will stop somewhere quiet, panting from the exercise. After four weeks in lockdown, Leo tells me his relationship with his wife has deteriorated further. (I don’t take pleasure in this.) She is, understandably, anxious and needy. The kids have cabin fever. He is the chef and chief “cheerer-upper”, but this has become wearing. Less burdened with family responsibility, I try to make him laugh, and it isn’t long before he makes me laugh, too. There is less intimacy (he is calling on a suburban street, after all). Instead we show our love through psychological support and fantasies about our eventual reunion. As for the virus, Leo is a healthy man in his late 40s. But I do worry; if he became ill, I have no idea how I would find out – except from the radio silence. I don’t know his landline number or his address; I have met only one of his male friends. If the very worst happened, I would be that mysterious woman you see in the movies, lurking at the back of a graveyard with big sunglasses and a black trenchcoat. (This is what happens when a person with an overactive imagination goes into lockdown.) The toughest thing is the sense of powerlessness that comes with most of our communication flowing only one way. Anxiety aside, I am an impatient person who doesn’t enjoy waiting. Today, when Leo finally calls just before 6pm, any irritation evaporates – partly in relief, partly in empathy. The question is: do I want to keep putting myself through this? And who knows how things will be when we get back to normal. My philosophy is this: if things don’t work out between us, I will be very upset, but not destroyed. My corona affair has taught me that I can love again after a horrible marriage breakup – and be loved again in return. • Names and details have been changed.', 'charCount': '5005', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': 'Anonymous'}","[{'id': 'lifeandstyle/relationships', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Relationships', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/relationships', 'references': []}, {'id': 'lifeandstyle/family', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Family', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/family', 'references': []}, {'id': 'lifeandstyle/sex', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Sex', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/sex', 'references': [], 'description': '<p>Sex and relationship advice, sexual health, sexuality, and sex tips – our full archive of pieces on sex and sexuality</p>'}, {'id': 'lifeandstyle/divorce', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Divorce', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/divorce', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/divorce', 'references': []}, {'id': 'lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Life and style', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle', 'references': []}, {'id': 'lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Parents and parenting', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/features', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features', 'references': []}, {'id': 'publication/theguardian', 'type': 'publication', 'sectionId': 'theguardian', 'sectionName': 'From the Guardian', 'webTitle': 'The Guardian', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian', 'references': [], 'description': ""All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice.""}, {'id': 'theguardian/weekend', 'type': 'newspaper-book', 'sectionId': 'lifeandstyle', 'sectionName': 'Life and style', 'webTitle': 'Weekend', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/weekend', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/weekend', 'references': []}, {'id': 'theguardian/weekend/features2', 'type': 'newspaper-book-section', 'sectionId': 'theguardian', 'sectionName': 'From the Guardian', 'webTitle': 'Features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/weekend/features2', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/weekend/features2', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tracking/commissioningdesk/weekend', 'type': 'tracking', 'webTitle': 'UK Weekend', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/weekend', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/weekend', 'references': []}]",False,pillar/lifestyle,Lifestyle,I'm involved with a married man.

It opens with a track about scientists racing for an unspecified cure, and the sequence of songs at its centre – Waitin’ for a Superman, Suddenly Everything Has Changed, The Gash and Feeling Yourself Disintegrate – all seemed bizarrely appropriate.</p> <p>The relationship we have with music might have altered under lockdown. It’s not just that songs seem to have taken on new, apposite resonances given the current situation, but music that you unexpectedly find yourself leaning towards, because you find it chimes with your mood: it’s comforting, elevating or transporting. I speak as someone who recently spent an admittedly tipsy evening listening to what a friend called mumcore: the kind of music parents gravitated toward when I was a kid, somewhere on the cusp of chart pop and easy listening. I can’t profess any great personal passion for Dr Hook’s When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman or Marti Webb’s Take That Look Off Your Face, but at that particular moment it sounded reassuring, a little wallow in nostalgia for a time when I had nothing to worry about.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvvGYEjloOg""                                                                        >  <iframe height=""259"" width=""460"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvvGYEjloOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In fairness, there isn’t much data to suggest that listeners’ habits have changed. The Official Charts company suggest that we got through the <a href=""https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-official-lockdown-listening-list-the-classic-songs-enjoying-an-unexpected-resurgence__29221/"">first week of lockdown</a> with a combination of gallows humour – surges in popularity for REM’s It’s the End of the World As We Know It and the Police’s Don’t Stand So Close to Me – and inspirational anthems such as Imagine and You’ll Never Walk Alone. However, the <a href=""https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/"">UK singles chart</a> is the same as usual: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and the Weeknd.</p> <p>The album charts are filled with the kind of best-of collections that seem to enjoy such permanent residence there you wonder who’s still buying them: how can anyone who wants to hear the greatest hits of Queen, Fleetwood Mac or Elton John not already own them? There’s a vague intimation about the streaming figures on Spotify that parents of a certain age are home more than usual and listening to Wonderwall and Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader, but there’s nothing in the way of major anomalies, beyond a boost in streams for the late <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen"">John Prine</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps this is all evidence that music is fulfilling a keep-calm-and-carry-on function at the moment – normality in a wildly abnormal world – but I think it’s more likely evidence that the charts deal in broad brushstrokes and the kind of response I’m talking about is unique and personal. If, as Zoe Williams <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/why-are-we-talking-about-morrissey-and-buffy-because-cultural-nostalgia-is-now-king"">recently suggested</a>, lockdown means that, culturally, “we are all basically living out of the store cupboard – all the music and literature and thought-paraphernalia you have carelessly stashed over the past few decades”, then everyone’s stash of memories is bound to be different, particularly the stuff we find ourselves digging deep for, the stuff we find chimes more loudly with us than the standard-issue all-purpose crisis anthems such as Imagine or You’ll Never Walk Alone. So what’s your experience? What music has struck you in a way you didn’t anticipate? And when this is all over, will you want to listen to it again?</p> <h2>We’ll see a return to fantasy</h2> <p><strong>Laura Snapes, deputy music editor</strong></p> <p>Months before the coronavirus pandemic, pop stars were whispering about pivoting back to escapism. Trauma was wearing out its hold on the charts, especially since a generation of rappers had been wiped out by addiction, depression and gun violence. Feeble lyrics by major pop acts about feeling unpopular and awkward were wearing thin, while musicians venturing personal intimacies largely found them turned into grist for an unforgiving gossip mill.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg"" alt=""Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017."" width=""1000"" height=""666"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know, when it’s no longer a choice,” <a href=""https://www.wmagazine.com/story/frank-ocean-cover-story-interview/"">Frank Ocean told W Magazine</a>. “Like, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I’m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.” And as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/03/dua-lipa-you-have-to-be-made-of-steel-to-not-let-words-get-to-you"">Dua Lipa was teasing what would turn out to be a pointedly escapist second album</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga"">Lady Gaga</a> was threatening a return to the high-concept dance-pop that made her a star.</p> <p>The pandemic won’t slow this shift. Once lockdown is over, after months of fear for everyone and far more grievous circumstances for many, the idea of having to relive this period via a glut of insular, anxious pop music just sounds like prolonging the agony. Although we’ve quickly acclimatised to seeing grainy FaceTime feeds on national TV, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/livestreaming-beat-battles-lockdown-skepta-timabaland-self-isolating"">lo-fi beat battles through Instagram Live</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGwQZrDNLO8&amp;feature=emb_title"">music videos made on Zoom</a>, those homespun production values will only increase fans’ hunger for the kind of high-end production you can’t easily put together on the fly – especially if, as healthcare experts are suggesting, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/magazine/coronavirus-economy-debate.html?referringSource=articleShare"">live music and festivals might not realistically return until late 2021</a>. Transportive fantasias might be all we have.</p> <p>Perhaps it might shift fans’ attitudes, too. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/charli-xcx"">Charli XCX</a> has committed to producing an album, How I’m Feeling Now, from scratch during lockdown, to be released on 15 May. She’s working with producers AG Cook and BJ Burton, so it’s not totally a one-woman show, but presumably the results will demonstrate the limitations of creating at speed. You’d hope it might engender some patience and appreciation for craft from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/15/leave-rihanna-alone-a-manifesto-for-healthier-pop-fandom-in-the-2020s"">fans inclined to demand ever more music from their faves</a>. Maybe these straitened times will also help pop stars – especially women – refuse inessential elements of the job. In the New York Times profile of Lipa releasing her album in lockdown, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-coronavirus.html"">she remarked on how doing her own styling</a> for the paper’s socially distanced photoshoot showed “a very unfiltered version of yourself” and let her spend longer in bed. (That Lipa is genetically blessed obviously helps.)</p> <p>Ultimately, pop will emerge from this period in better shape than less lucrative and exposed forms of music – though it’s still going to be forced into new shapes by club culture.

It opens with a track about scientists racing for an unspecified cure, and the sequence of songs at its centre – Waitin’ for a Superman, Suddenly Everything Has Changed, The Gash and Feeling Yourself Disintegrate – all seemed bizarrely appropriate. The relationship we have with music might have altered under lockdown. It’s not just that songs seem to have taken on new, apposite resonances given the current situation, but music that you unexpectedly find yourself leaning towards, because you find it chimes with your mood: it’s comforting, elevating or transporting. I speak as someone who recently spent an admittedly tipsy evening listening to what a friend called mumcore: the kind of music parents gravitated toward when I was a kid, somewhere on the cusp of chart pop and easy listening. I can’t profess any great personal passion for Dr Hook’s When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman or Marti Webb’s Take That Look Off Your Face, but at that particular moment it sounded reassuring, a little wallow in nostalgia for a time when I had nothing to worry about. In fairness, there isn’t much data to suggest that listeners’ habits have changed. The Official Charts company suggest that we got through the first week of lockdown with a combination of gallows humour – surges in popularity for REM’s It’s the End of the World As We Know It and the Police’s Don’t Stand So Close to Me – and inspirational anthems such as Imagine and You’ll Never Walk Alone. However, the UK singles chart is the same as usual: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and the Weeknd. The album charts are filled with the kind of best-of collections that seem to enjoy such permanent residence there you wonder who’s still buying them: how can anyone who wants to hear the greatest hits of Queen, Fleetwood Mac or Elton John not already own them? There’s a vague intimation about the streaming figures on Spotify that parents of a certain age are home more than usual and listening to Wonderwall and Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader, but there’s nothing in the way of major anomalies, beyond a boost in streams for the late John Prine. Perhaps this is all evidence that music is fulfilling a keep-calm-and-carry-on function at the moment – normality in a wildly abnormal world – but I think it’s more likely evidence that the charts deal in broad brushstrokes and the kind of response I’m talking about is unique and personal. If, as Zoe Williams recently suggested, lockdown means that, culturally, “we are all basically living out of the store cupboard – all the music and literature and thought-paraphernalia you have carelessly stashed over the past few decades”, then everyone’s stash of memories is bound to be different, particularly the stuff we find ourselves digging deep for, the stuff we find chimes more loudly with us than the standard-issue all-purpose crisis anthems such as Imagine or You’ll Never Walk Alone. So what’s your experience? What music has struck you in a way you didn’t anticipate? And when this is all over, will you want to listen to it again? We’ll see a return to fantasy Laura Snapes, deputy music editor Months before the coronavirus pandemic, pop stars were whispering about pivoting back to escapism. Trauma was wearing out its hold on the charts, especially since a generation of rappers had been wiped out by addiction, depression and gun violence. Feeble lyrics by major pop acts about feeling unpopular and awkward were wearing thin, while musicians venturing personal intimacies largely found them turned into grist for an unforgiving gossip mill. “The expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know, when it’s no longer a choice,” Frank Ocean told W Magazine. “Like, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I’m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.” And as Dua Lipa was teasing what would turn out to be a pointedly escapist second album, Lady Gaga was threatening a return to the high-concept dance-pop that made her a star. The pandemic won’t slow this shift. Once lockdown is over, after months of fear for everyone and far more grievous circumstances for many, the idea of having to relive this period via a glut of insular, anxious pop music just sounds like prolonging the agony. Although we’ve quickly acclimatised to seeing grainy FaceTime feeds on national TV, lo-fi beat battles through Instagram Live and music videos made on Zoom, those homespun production values will only increase fans’ hunger for the kind of high-end production you can’t easily put together on the fly – especially if, as healthcare experts are suggesting, live music and festivals might not realistically return until late 2021. Transportive fantasias might be all we have. Perhaps it might shift fans’ attitudes, too. Charli XCX has committed to producing an album, How I’m Feeling Now, from scratch during lockdown, to be released on 15 May. She’s working with producers AG Cook and BJ Burton, so it’s not totally a one-woman show, but presumably the results will demonstrate the limitations of creating at speed. You’d hope it might engender some patience and appreciation for craft from fans inclined to demand ever more music from their faves. Maybe these straitened times will also help pop stars – especially women – refuse inessential elements of the job. In the New York Times profile of Lipa releasing her album in lockdown, she remarked on how doing her own styling for the paper’s socially distanced photoshoot showed “a very unfiltered version of yourself” and let her spend longer in bed. (That Lipa is genetically blessed obviously helps.) Ultimately, pop will emerge from this period in better shape than less lucrative and exposed forms of music – though it’s still going to be forced into new shapes by club culture. Dozens of clubs will close during this period; tour revenues for DJs will be destroyed. But dance music is the living embodiment of how necessity is the mother of invention. Perhaps more so than any other music community, club culture provides a lifeline for its often marginalised participants, and has a progressive social imperative at its heart: it will find new sounds and spaces and spring back, because it has to.

It opens with a track about scientists racing for an unspecified cure, and the sequence of songs at its centre – Waitin’ for a Superman, Suddenly Everything Has Changed, The Gash and Feeling Yourself Disintegrate – all seemed bizarrely appropriate. The relationship we have with music might have altered under lockdown. It’s not just that songs seem to have taken on new, apposite resonances given the current situation, but music that you unexpectedly find yourself leaning towards, because you find it chimes with your mood: it’s comforting, elevating or transporting. I speak as someone who recently spent an admittedly tipsy evening listening to what a friend called mumcore: the kind of music parents gravitated toward when I was a kid, somewhere on the cusp of chart pop and easy listening. I can’t profess any great personal passion for Dr Hook’s When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman or Marti Webb’s Take That Look Off Your Face, but at that particular moment it sounded reassuring, a little wallow in nostalgia for a time when I had nothing to worry about. In fairness, there isn’t much data to suggest that listeners’ habits have changed. The Official Charts company suggest that we got through the first week of lockdown with a combination of gallows humour – surges in popularity for REM’s It’s the End of the World As We Know It and the Police’s Don’t Stand So Close to Me – and inspirational anthems such as Imagine and You’ll Never Walk Alone. However, the UK singles chart is the same as usual: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and the Weeknd. The album charts are filled with the kind of best-of collections that seem to enjoy such permanent residence there you wonder who’s still buying them: how can anyone who wants to hear the greatest hits of Queen, Fleetwood Mac or Elton John not already own them? There’s a vague intimation about the streaming figures on Spotify that parents of a certain age are home more than usual and listening to Wonderwall and Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader, but there’s nothing in the way of major anomalies, beyond a boost in streams for the late John Prine. Perhaps this is all evidence that music is fulfilling a keep-calm-and-carry-on function at the moment – normality in a wildly abnormal world – but I think it’s more likely evidence that the charts deal in broad brushstrokes and the kind of response I’m talking about is unique and personal. If, as Zoe Williams recently suggested, lockdown means that, culturally, “we are all basically living out of the store cupboard – all the music and literature and thought-paraphernalia you have carelessly stashed over the past few decades”, then everyone’s stash of memories is bound to be different, particularly the stuff we find ourselves digging deep for, the stuff we find chimes more loudly with us than the standard-issue all-purpose crisis anthems such as Imagine or You’ll Never Walk Alone. So what’s your experience? What music has struck you in a way you didn’t anticipate? And when this is all over, will you want to listen to it again? We’ll see a return to fantasy Laura Snapes, deputy music editor Months before the coronavirus pandemic, pop stars were whispering about pivoting back to escapism. Trauma was wearing out its hold on the charts, especially since a generation of rappers had been wiped out by addiction, depression and gun violence. Feeble lyrics by major pop acts about feeling unpopular and awkward were wearing thin, while musicians venturing personal intimacies largely found them turned into grist for an unforgiving gossip mill. “The expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know, when it’s no longer a choice,” Frank Ocean told W Magazine. “Like, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I’m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.” And as Dua Lipa was teasing what would turn out to be a pointedly escapist second album, Lady Gaga was threatening a return to the high-concept dance-pop that made her a star. The pandemic won’t slow this shift. Once lockdown is over, after months of fear for everyone and far more grievous circumstances for many, the idea of having to relive this period via a glut of insular, anxious pop music just sounds like prolonging the agony. Although we’ve quickly acclimatised to seeing grainy FaceTime feeds on national TV, lo-fi beat battles through Instagram Live and music videos made on Zoom, those homespun production values will only increase fans’ hunger for the kind of high-end production you can’t easily put together on the fly – especially if, as healthcare experts are suggesting, live music and festivals might not realistically return until late 2021. Transportive fantasias might be all we have. Perhaps it might shift fans’ attitudes, too. Charli XCX has committed to producing an album, How I’m Feeling Now, from scratch during lockdown, to be released on 15 May. She’s working with producers AG Cook and BJ Burton, so it’s not totally a one-woman show, but presumably the results will demonstrate the limitations of creating at speed. You’d hope it might engender some patience and appreciation for craft from fans inclined to demand ever more music from their faves. Maybe these straitened times will also help pop stars – especially women – refuse inessential elements of the job. In the New York Times profile of Lipa releasing her album in lockdown, she remarked on how doing her own styling for the paper’s socially distanced photoshoot showed “a very unfiltered version of yourself” and let her spend longer in bed. (That Lipa is genetically blessed obviously helps.) Ultimately, pop will emerge from this period in better shape than less lucrative and exposed forms of music – though it’s still going to be forced into new shapes by club culture. Dozens of clubs will close during this period; tour revenues for DJs will be destroyed. But dance music is the living embodiment of how necessity is the mother of invention. Perhaps more so than any other music community, club culture provides a lifeline for its often marginalised participants, and has a progressive social imperative at its heart: it will find new sounds and spaces and spring back, because it has to. (Plus, parties are far easier to organise at the drop of a hat – or the relaxing of a social distancing order – than a fully fledged festival.) You only have to look at the divide between the thrilling, emergent dance singles and lumpen, complacent pop in 1988 and 1989 to realise that the latter’s contemporary catalysts would be foolish not to pay very close attention. Rap will become more introverted Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor So much of the grist for mainstream rap lyricshas been ruined by coronavirus. The club? Closed. Rolls-Royce dealership? Furloughed. Sex with women who you aren’t planning to self-isolate with for more than 45 minutes? Now even more morally dubious. So what do you rap about?

Rutnam was emotional as he said he would step down after 33 years because he had become the “target of vicious and orchestrated campaign against him,” which he accused Patel of orchestrating. The Labour leadership contender Sir Keir Starmer demanded that Patel attend parliament on Monday to explain herself and called for the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to investigate the circumstances surrounding Rutnam’s departure. Rutnam, the former permanent secretary, said he had been accused of briefing the media against Patel, an accusation he said was completely false. “The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office.

A statement from Sedwill thanked Rutnam for his “long and dedicated career of public service” and announced that Shona Dunn, the second permanent secretary at the Home Office responsible for borders, immigration and citizenship, would become acting permanent secretary. Rutnam’s resignation is likely to intensify criticism of the home secretary and put renewed focus on the drive by the PM’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, to shake up the civil service. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said the allegations reflected “extremely badly on the government”. She said: “To end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government. “For the home secretary and prime minister to have allowed things to reach this point is appalling, especially at a time when the Home Office faces crucial challenges with rising violent crime, forthcoming counter-terror legislation, new immigration laws, and sensitive negotiations on post-Brexit security cooperation.” Cooper said an employment tribunal could take months. “We cannot afford to have a dysfunctional and distracted Home Office while this tribunal is going on,” she said. “The work of the Home Office and the home secretary is far too important for that.

Labour’s Stephen Doughty, a member of the Commons home affairs committee during the last parliament, said Patel’s position as home secretary “must now also be in question”. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, said serious questions needed to be asked about the culture that was being created at the Home Office. “The Tories are acting just like Donald Trump, putting ideology ahead of competence, and it’s the British people who will pay the price,” she said. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior public servants’ union, said the resignation “demonstrates once again the destructive consequences of anonymous briefings against public servants who are unable to publicly defend themselves”. He said: “This cowardly practice is not only ruining lives and careers but at a time when the Home Office is being tasked with delivering a demanding government agenda on immigration, and preparing for a public health emergency, it has diverted energy and resource into responding to unfounded accusations from sources claiming to be allies of the home secretary.” Penman said the Home Office now needed to find new leadership at a time when it needed stability.

Tiny communities with no cases of their own are understandably afraid of what wealthy urban refugees may bring with them, and fear curdles all too easily into resentment.</p> <p>But the age-old divide between town and country isn’t the only one at risk of widening. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, today moved a long way to bridging an emerging gap between the conventionally employed (whose <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak"">salaries will be part-guaranteed</a> by the state if their jobs are frozen) and the anxiously self-employed, who are now promised a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings"">similarly generous lifeline</a>. The latter may have to wait until early June for the money, with the universal credit system <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/universal-credit-claims-almost-impossible-as-more-than-500000-apply"">buckling under the strain</a> of new claims, however, and isn’t for the highest earners; meanwhile, Sunak hinted the quid pro quo could be reform of tax perks for the self-employed after we emerge from this crisis.</p> <p>The safety net knitted last week at breakneck speed, meanwhile, is already starting to fray at the edges. Renters worry that their three-month reprieve from eviction <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-renters-eviction-notices-uk-boris-johnson-a9420671.html"">might not be as watertight as it looked</a>; older people, told they can stay in and simply order food online, are being left with little choice but to venture out when <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/supermarkets-use-database-to-prioritise-deliveries-to-elderly"">supermarket delivery slots</a> are booked solid for weeks.</p> <p>So far, this virus is mainly exposing divisions that we already knew existed. We hardly needed a virus to tell us that the royals are privileged, work is precarious for many, and some families have resources others don’t – whether that’s a cottage by the sea, a back garden to play in, or the skills to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/home-schooling-teachers-child-coronavirus"">teach their own children</a>. Kids whose parents are now raiding the internet for kitchen science experiments will lose less ground academically over this long summer than those whose parents struggle with basic maths themselves – widening attainment gaps that were stubborn enough before.</p> <p>But as time goes on, this virus may create unexpected new divides too. We desperately need <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days"">mass antibody testing</a>, said to be only weeks away, to establish who has already had the virus and might now be immune, on top of the existing tests showing who has it now. Reliable testing would let key workers go back to the frontline – or in some cases back home – and others return to the kind of non-essential jobs that keep an economy ticking over. </p> <p>But testing could also turn us overnight into a society of had-its and haven’t-yets: the former free to roam the outside world again; and the latter still stuck indoors, worrying about their jobs. We can overcome this divide, like any divide, given far-sighted political leadership and individual generosity, but only if we see it coming.</p> <p>It may seem churlish to dwell on what divides us rather than what we are discovering we have in common. But the lesson of an epidemic that has seen doctors raiding DIY stores for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/nhs-under-pressure-voices-from-the-frontline-of-the-coronavirus-crisis"">protective masks</a>, and children separated from their mothers by cold hard glass, is that it pays to be one step ahead, not running to catch up; that where we are now is not necessarily where we will be tomorrow. A crisis that has so far brought us together may soon, if we’re not careful, begin to push us apart.</p> <p>• Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '5', 'wordcount': '974', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-03-26T15:45:01Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-03-26T19:19:55Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-03-27T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dgznf', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/55420aff1007bbc8ea15f7602e3e0f4b51c165a8/0_76_4484_2690/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'We are all still in this together.

The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, today moved a long way to bridging an emerging gap between the conventionally employed (whose salaries will be part-guaranteed by the state if their jobs are frozen) and the anxiously self-employed, who are now promised a similarly generous lifeline. The latter may have to wait until early June for the money, with the universal credit system buckling under the strain of new claims, however, and isn’t for the highest earners; meanwhile, Sunak hinted the quid pro quo could be reform of tax perks for the self-employed after we emerge from this crisis. The safety net knitted last week at breakneck speed, meanwhile, is already starting to fray at the edges. Renters worry that their three-month reprieve from eviction might not be as watertight as it looked; older people, told they can stay in and simply order food online, are being left with little choice but to venture out when supermarket delivery slots are booked solid for weeks. So far, this virus is mainly exposing divisions that we already knew existed. We hardly needed a virus to tell us that the royals are privileged, work is precarious for many, and some families have resources others don’t – whether that’s a cottage by the sea, a back garden to play in, or the skills to teach their own children. Kids whose parents are now raiding the internet for kitchen science experiments will lose less ground academically over this long summer than those whose parents struggle with basic maths themselves – widening attainment gaps that were stubborn enough before. But as time goes on, this virus may create unexpected new divides too. We desperately need mass antibody testing, said to be only weeks away, to establish who has already had the virus and might now be immune, on top of the existing tests showing who has it now. Reliable testing would let key workers go back to the frontline – or in some cases back home – and others return to the kind of non-essential jobs that keep an economy ticking over. But testing could also turn us overnight into a society of had-its and haven’t-yets: the former free to roam the outside world again; and the latter still stuck indoors, worrying about their jobs. We can overcome this divide, like any divide, given far-sighted political leadership and individual generosity, but only if we see it coming. It may seem churlish to dwell on what divides us rather than what we are discovering we have in common. But the lesson of an epidemic that has seen doctors raiding DIY stores for protective masks, and children separated from their mothers by cold hard glass, is that it pays to be one step ahead, not running to catch up; that where we are now is not necessarily where we will be tomorrow. A crisis that has so far brought us together may soon, if we’re not careful, begin to push us apart. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist', 'charCount': '5630', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false',

He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”</p> \n<p>He said he had asked two companies offering treatment for coronavirus to contact London “immediately”. “They’ve really advanced therapeutics ... and they have arrived in London already, the London office has whatever they need. We’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.”</p> \n<p>Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place.</p> \n<p>He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic. </p> \n<p>Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.”</p> \n<p>The decision to hand over power to Raab, 46, was taken after concern in the cabinet and among MPs that Johnson should have been resting instead of working. It also comes amid suggestions that the seriousness of the prime minster’s coronavirus symptoms – including a persistent cough and high temperature - were being underplayed by himself and his aides.</p> \n<p>At midday on Monday, Downing Street was still insisting that the prime minister was able to read his red box of government papers, and at the daily 5pm press conference, Raab claimed Johnson was still fully in charge and issuing instructions.</p> \n<p>No 10 had insisted earlier on Monday that Johnson was only in hospital as a “precautionary measure” and for “routine tests”, having said up until his admission on Sunday evening that he was suffering from mild symptoms.</p> \n<p>Claims that his condition had not deteriorated came under increased scrutiny after it emerged that a bed at St Thomas’ was being prepared for Johnson as early as Thursday last week. He spent Sunday night on an empty wing that is normally used for elective procedures, a source said, before being moved to intensive care on Monday evening.</p> \n<p>Before his move to intensive care, the Guardian was told of frustration among ministers over Johnson remaining in charge for so long rather than resting, even after he had received oxygen treatment having failed to shake off Covid-19 symptoms for 11 days.</p> \n<p>It came as the UK death toll from coronavirus exceeded 5,000 for the first time, rising by 439 to 5,373.

In an unprecedented development during a public health crisis, the prime minister was moved to intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital, London, at 7pm on Monday as a precaution in case he needed ventilation, it was said. He remained conscious on Monday night. A No 10 spokesman said: “Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital. “The prime minister has asked foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.” Intensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since first being admitted to St Thomas’ on Sunday evening, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask only. His pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms – was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson’s condition. News of his hospitalisation, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from US president Donald Trump to French president Emmanuel Macron sending their best wishes and support for Johnson’s recovery. Trump said: “We’re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.” He said he had asked two companies offering treatment for coronavirus to contact London “immediately”. “They’ve really advanced therapeutics ... and they have arrived in London already, the London office has whatever they need. We’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.” Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place. He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic. Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.” The decision to hand over power to Raab, 46, was taken after concern in the cabinet and among MPs that Johnson should have been resting instead of working. It also comes amid suggestions that the seriousness of the prime minster’s coronavirus symptoms – including a persistent cough and high temperature - were being underplayed by himself and his aides. At midday on Monday, Downing Street was still insisting that the prime minister was able to read his red box of government papers, and at the daily 5pm press conference, Raab claimed Johnson was still fully in charge and issuing instructions. No 10 had insisted earlier on Monday that Johnson was only in hospital as a “precautionary measure” and for “routine tests”, having said up until his admission on Sunday evening that he was suffering from mild symptoms. Claims that his condition had not deteriorated came under increased scrutiny after it emerged that a bed at St Thomas’ was being prepared for Johnson as early as Thursday last week. He spent Sunday night on an empty wing that is normally used for elective procedures, a source said, before being moved to intensive care on Monday evening. Before his move to intensive care, the Guardian was told of frustration among ministers over Johnson remaining in charge for so long rather than resting, even after he had received oxygen treatment having failed to shake off Covid-19 symptoms for 11 days. It came as the UK death toll from coronavirus exceeded 5,000 for the first time, rising by 439 to 5,373. The daily reported increase fell for the second day in a row, but a Department of Health source cautioned that this can be due to lower reporting at weekends and said the trend needs to be lower during the week to be a cause for optimism. At the daily Downing Street press conference at 5pm, Raab said it remained the case that Johnson was “in charge, he is leading and giving instructions as and when required”. However, he later admitted not having spoken to Johnson since Saturday – the day before the prime minister’s admission to hospital on medical advice. No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” about Johnson’s medical condition, despite having claimed up until the point of his hospital admission that his symptoms were “mild”. His spokesman dropped that description on Monday, saying instead that his cough and temperature were “persistent”. Two ministers, James Duddridge and Nadine Dorries, suggested Johnson needed time to recuperate. Duddridge said it was important for the prime minister to now “rest, look after yourself and let the others do the heavy [lifting]”. But Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had good reasons for not wanting to step away until now. He told the BBC: “His first thought has not actually been for himself, it has been in a sense for the British people. He doesn’t want the British people to feel in any way overly concerned and worried. He wants them to be calm, which goes to the nature of the individual he is.” Duncan Smith also attempted to calm fears around Johnson’s admission, saying the public “shouldn’t over-read the going into intensive care”. “I am certain that the doctors will have done this to make sure that they can stabilise him completely so they can treat whatever he may have. As I say, he may have a strong secondary infection which needs to be treated and treated rather urgently,” he said. After the prime minister’s hospital admission, Raab led the daily coronavirus morning meeting, known internally as the “war cabinet”. But several cabinet sources said there was a worry that Johnson’s refusal to let go of power had been causing impotence at the top of government. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior adviser, is also isolating with coronavirus symptoms and has not yet returned to work. While the prime minister has been in self-isolation for over a week, reported tensions between Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, emerged over the competing demands of the health impacts of coronavirus and its effects on the economy. Tory sources insisted any problems were largely at the level of officials. Meanwhile, No 10 and the Department of Health have been frustrated with both NHS England, for allegedly failing to share data quickly enough at “sit-rep” [situation reports] meetings on the state of services, and Public Health England, for not agreeing to look to private firms for outside testing capacity quickly enough. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, also said it was “too early” and a “mistake” to have a “serious discussion about all the things we need to do step-by-step to move to the next phase of managing this” without the UK having seen a peak in cases.

We’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.” Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place. He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic. Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.” The decision to hand over power to Raab, 46, was taken after concern in the cabinet and among MPs that Johnson should have been resting instead of working. It also comes amid suggestions that the seriousness of the prime minster’s coronavirus symptoms – including a persistent cough and high temperature - were being underplayed by himself and his aides. At midday on Monday, Downing Street was still insisting that the prime minister was able to read his red box of government papers, and at the daily 5pm press conference, Raab claimed Johnson was still fully in charge and issuing instructions. No 10 had insisted earlier on Monday that Johnson was only in hospital as a “precautionary measure” and for “routine tests”, having said up until his admission on Sunday evening that he was suffering from mild symptoms. Claims that his condition had not deteriorated came under increased scrutiny after it emerged that a bed at St Thomas’ was being prepared for Johnson as early as Thursday last week. He spent Sunday night on an empty wing that is normally used for elective procedures, a source said, before being moved to intensive care on Monday evening. Before his move to intensive care, the Guardian was told of frustration among ministers over Johnson remaining in charge for so long rather than resting, even after he had received oxygen treatment having failed to shake off Covid-19 symptoms for 11 days. It came as the UK death toll from coronavirus exceeded 5,000 for the first time, rising by 439 to 5,373. The daily reported increase fell for the second day in a row, but a Department of Health source cautioned that this can be due to lower reporting at weekends and said the trend needs to be lower during the week to be a cause for optimism. At the daily Downing Street press conference at 5pm, Raab said it remained the case that Johnson was “in charge, he is leading and giving instructions as and when required”. However, he later admitted not having spoken to Johnson since Saturday – the day before the prime minister’s admission to hospital on medical advice. No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” about Johnson’s medical condition, despite having claimed up until the point of his hospital admission that his symptoms were “mild”. His spokesman dropped that description on Monday, saying instead that his cough and temperature were “persistent”. Two ministers, James Duddridge and Nadine Dorries, suggested Johnson needed time to recuperate. Duddridge said it was important for the prime minister to now “rest, look after yourself and let the others do the heavy [lifting]”. But Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had good reasons for not wanting to step away until now. He told the BBC: “His first thought has not actually been for himself, it has been in a sense for the British people. He doesn’t want the British people to feel in any way overly concerned and worried. He wants them to be calm, which goes to the nature of the individual he is.” Duncan Smith also attempted to calm fears around Johnson’s admission, saying the public “shouldn’t over-read the going into intensive care”. “I am certain that the doctors will have done this to make sure that they can stabilise him completely so they can treat whatever he may have. As I say, he may have a strong secondary infection which needs to be treated and treated rather urgently,” he said. After the prime minister’s hospital admission, Raab led the daily coronavirus morning meeting, known internally as the “war cabinet”. But several cabinet sources said there was a worry that Johnson’s refusal to let go of power had been causing impotence at the top of government. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior adviser, is also isolating with coronavirus symptoms and has not yet returned to work. While the prime minister has been in self-isolation for over a week, reported tensions between Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, emerged over the competing demands of the health impacts of coronavirus and its effects on the economy. Tory sources insisted any problems were largely at the level of officials. Meanwhile, No 10 and the Department of Health have been frustrated with both NHS England, for allegedly failing to share data quickly enough at “sit-rep” [situation reports] meetings on the state of services, and Public Health England, for not agreeing to look to private firms for outside testing capacity quickly enough. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, also said it was “too early” and a “mistake” to have a “serious discussion about all the things we need to do step-by-step to move to the next phase of managing this” without the UK having seen a peak in cases. He also stressed the government would need to balance many factors in deciding whether to ease the lockdown. These include people dying directly from the virus itself, dying indirectly if the NHS became overwhelmed with cases, the effects of postponing other types of healthcare because of coronavirus, and the long-term health impact on people due to social and economic reasons.",7968,false,false,"<a href=""profile/rowena-mason"">Rowena Mason</a>,<a href=""profile/lisaocarroll"">Lisa O'Carroll</a> and <a href=""profile/dan-sabbagh"">Dan Sabbagh</a>",,,1,2020-04-07T00:00:00Z,,,,,2020-04-06,2020-04-02 00:00:00+00:00,0

The 12 new UK cases constitute the second highest single-day increase in cases to date. They include the first known cases in Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire. Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Kent. Dr Will Welfare, of Public Health England North West, said there were three new Covid-19 cases in Greater Manchester, including two from Bury. “As a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury,” he said. “The third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected whilst in Italy. “Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.” The previous case from Bury was said to have contracted the virus in Italy. Given that Public Health England (PHE) has said all the new cases were contracted after overseas travel rather than within the UK, the two latest cases from Bury are also likely to have travelled to Italy. Health officials in the Canary Islands said a woman who tested positive for coronavirus at a hotel in Tenerife on Monday is British and is now in hospital. The woman was one of 168 British tourists staying at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel when guests were placed in quarantine after Italian visitors who had recently stayed there tested positive for Covid-19. She is the sixth person at the hotel to test positive for coronavirus and the first Briton. On Monday, 148 guests left the 467-room hotel after they tested negative for the virus. PHE did not specify how many patients were in each of the other six areas with new cases on the daily list. It said contact tracing had begun. There have been 48 cases in England to date and one each in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. As of 9am on Tuesday, 13,860 people in the UK had tested negative for coronavirus.', 'charCount': '2625', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/haroonsiddique"">Haroon Siddique</a>'}","[{'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/health', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Health', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/health', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/health', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/society', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Society', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'type': 'campaign', 'webTitle': 'callout-coronavirus', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/campaign/callout/callout-coronavirus', 'references': [], 'campaignInformationType': 'callout'}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/haroonsiddique', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Haroon Siddique', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/haroonsiddique', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/haroonsiddique', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Haroon Siddique is a senior reporter.

All of us are willing them to get it right, to acquire the missing ventilators and protective equipment for NHS and social care staff. We need their “whatever it takes” to find a vaccine and a cure. We need “whatever it takes” to keep employees paid, mortgages suspended and companies afloat. But it took Labour to point out the equally desperate needs of the self-employed and renters – still inadequately helped. It will need Labour voices to keep pointing to weaknesses in safety nets or services failing. What’s more, the government will need Labour support to retain public trust as some of these draconian measures are implemented. MP George Freeman, in a moment of mischief perhaps, has piped up to call for a government of national unity. No doubt there are Tories who want to make sure, whatever happens, that Labour is fully implicated. For Labour, sharing in the burden of responsibility to support the country through this calamity is essential too, mindful of how Clement Attlee gained after the war from his share in power. But balancing scrutiny of government with support for sometimes unpopular actions will be delicate. An end to politics? Try this thought experiment: had Labour been in power, would the Tories have backed them to empty the treasury to keep jobs and families going, or would they have accused them of using the crisis to further socialism? The Electoral Reform Society advocates copying Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister: in a fine gesture, she has set up a scrutiny select committee chaired by the leader of the opposition, with a non-government majority, to meet three times weekly by video link to keep a check on her government’s powers. Can anyone imagine Johnson affording Labour such power? For now, everyone pulling together is the mood of the moment, as seen in the admirable public volunteering surge. But beyond this four-week recess, in the long unknowable future, democracy can’t be suspended. The Speaker should use this break to surprise us all with the same willingness to change shown by everyone else in this emergency. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist', 'charCount': '5560', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/pollytoynbee"">Polly Toynbee</a>'}","[{'id': 'commentisfree/commentisfree', 'type': 'blog', 'sectionId': 'commentisfree', 'sectionName': 'Opinion', 'webTitle': 'Opinion', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'science/infectiousdiseases', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'science', 'sectionName': 'Science', 'webTitle': 'Infectious diseases', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/world', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'World news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/world', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/politics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics', 'references': [], 'description': '<p><br></p>'}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/comment', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Comment', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/pollytoynbee', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Polly Toynbee', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/pollytoynbee', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist.

The announcement came shortly after Sunak told the BBC the UK recession was “already happening” what with the loss of jobs and rise in Universal Credit claims. </li> \n   <li><strong>There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, official figures indicated.</strong> This places the UK with the second-worst death toll in the world, after the US. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, include deaths where Covid-19 was named on the death certificate as a factor. </li> \n   <li><strong>The care home death rate has almost halved in the past few weeks, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said</strong>. It came as new figures were released on care home fatalities, with the ONS revealing that about 40% of Covid-19-related deaths – 2,423 – registered in the week ending 1 May in England and Wales were in care homes, the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March. The figures showed that at least 10,535 deaths to date have occurred in settings outside hospitals.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>People should use cars if they can’t walk or cycle, in order to avoid using public transport, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said.</strong> For those who have to use public transport, new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers"">transport guidance</a> published by the government advised people to face away from each other if it isn’t possible to keep a 2 metre gap between them.

class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>A study of staff at an NHS hospital has suggested that 3% of staff reporting as fit for duty in April were unknowingly infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Researchers at <strong>Cambridge University</strong> swabbed and tested more than 1,200 NHS workers at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge throughout April, with staff also asked about relevant coronavirus symptoms.</p> \n  <p>More than 1,000 workers reported that they were fit for duty during the study period, but 3% of them tested positive for Covid-19. <strong>Dr Mike Weekes</strong>, one of the authors of the report, said staff need to be tested regularly “regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms”.</p> \n  <p>Under closer questioning as part of the study, around one in five staff reported no symptoms, two in five had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported Covid-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously.</p> \n  <p>Weekes and his fellow senior author, <strong>Prof Stephen Baker</strong>, from the <strong>Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease</strong>, said hospitals needed to introduce screening programmes across their workforces. Weekes said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=""quoted""> \n   <p>Test! Test! Test! And then test some more.</p> \n   <p>All staff need to get tested regularly for Covid-19, regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms – this will be vital to stop infection spreading within the hospital setting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The study, published in the journal <strong>eLife</strong>, also explored possible routes of transmission of the virus through the hospital and among staff. Researchers looked at whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in “red” areas of the hospital, caring for Covid-19 patients.</p> \n  <p>Despite wearing appropriate PPE, “red” area staff were three times more likely to test positive than staff working in Covid-19-free “green” areas, the study indicated. It is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of transmission from patients to staff in red areas, as staff may have instead transmitted the virus to each other or acquired it at home.</p> \n  <p>Those working in the “red” areas were also swabbed earlier in the study, closer to when the lockdown was first initiated, so the higher rates of infection in this group might just be a symptom of higher rates of virus circulating in the community at the time.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2020-05-12T12:18:08.756Z"">at 1.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-5eba8fb88f08d99d46a15652"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-05-12T12:02:19.017Z"">1.02pm <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>Employers have welcomed the announcement to extend the furlough scheme too.

While this will take significant time, we can guarantee that we will not retain the restrictions for any longer than is absolutely necessary,” the document reads.</p> \n   <p>However it is important that when taking decisions now, we recognise the risk of having to re-introduce restrictions if cases rise sharply again. That is why we will only decide to relax restrictions when we are sure that that is in the long-term interest of the health and wellbeing of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-5eba7ec48f08d99d46a1555e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-05-12T10:50:44.493Z"">11.50am <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>Tributes have been paid to an ambulance care assistant who died with coronavirus and who “dedicated his career to serving the public”.</p> \n  <p>Phil Rennie, a patient transport service care assistant for the North West ambulance service based in Oldham, contracted Covid-19 and died at Fairfield general hospital in Bury on Sunday, the service’s chief executive, Daren Mochrie, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=""quoted""> \n   <p>Phil was extremely proud to work for NWAS, offering comfort and care to those in need.

Would she send her child to school knowing what she does now?

Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections “we shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics and face the prospect of further partial or national lockdowns”, the authors write.</p> \n  <p>The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee.</p> \n  <p>The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19, and to replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group call for a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of the outbreak control. The report states that the “over-dependence on outsourcing” is unsustainable.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2020-05-12T11:16:07.358Z"">at 12.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=""block-5eba6e898f08d99d46a154bf"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> \n <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2020-05-12T09:47:08.691Z"">10.47am <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=""block-title"">Mervyn King urges Sunak not to scale back furlough scheme</h2> \n <div class=""block-elements""> \n  <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Mervyn King</strong>, the former governor of the Bank of England, said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should not scale back the coronavirus job retention scheme that allows workers to be furloughed. He said the government should continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries (as it does now, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month), instead of reducing that to 60%, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/extend-furlough-scheme-or-face-spiralling-job-losses-rishi-sunak-told"">as the Treasury has been considering.</a></p> \n  <p>Asked what Sunak should do, King said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=""quoted""> \n   <p>Keep it at 80%.</p> \n   <p>I don’t think it makes sense to regard this as the major cost of the Covid-19 crisis in economic terms.</p> \n   <p>These payments under government schemes are transfers from taxpayers in general to businesses, it will lead to an increase in national debt [but] we can finance that over a long period, particularly given the very low level of long-term real interest rates.</p> \n   <p>The real cost of this shutdown is not measured by the impact on the public finances but by the lost incomes and outputs in the economy, a cost which is likely to end up as an order of magnitude [though no one can really know this] of several hundred billion pounds.

Follow our global coverage here The government’s furlough scheme, where the state subsidises the wages off workers temporarily laid off because of the pandemic, will be extended until the end of October, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced. The four-month extension, which confirmed that the level of support will not be reduced and employers will be asked to contribute more, was welcomed by MPs from all sides as well as the unions. The announcement came shortly after Sunak told the BBC the UK recession was “already happening” what with the loss of jobs and rise in Universal Credit claims. There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, official figures indicated. This places the UK with the second-worst death toll in the world, after the US. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, include deaths where Covid-19 was named on the death certificate as a factor. The care home death rate has almost halved in the past few weeks, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said. It came as new figures were released on care home fatalities, with the ONS revealing that about 40% of Covid-19-related deaths – 2,423 – registered in the week ending 1 May in England and Wales were in care homes, the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March. The figures showed that at least 10,535 deaths to date have occurred in settings outside hospitals. People should use cars if they can’t walk or cycle, in order to avoid using public transport, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said. For those who have to use public transport, new transport guidance published by the government advised people to face away from each other if it isn’t possible to keep a 2 metre gap between them. Shapps also said face coverings should be worn as a precautionary measure and that passengers should avoid rush hour, re-plan visits, use contactless payments where at all possible and wash their hands before and after their journeys. Further coronavirus outbreaks and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists warned. The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic. The Northern Ireland executive published its own five-step coronavirus recovery plan. The 12-page document sets out the five steps, the first of which includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining physical distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis. That’s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Property viewings and visits to estate agents may be seen as a reasonable excuse for leaving the house, under regulations coming into force in England from Wednesday which could help to reinvigorate the market. Under previous rules put in place to help limit the spread of Covid-19, moving house where it was reasonably necessary was already deemed a valid excuse for people to be away from home. But under amendments to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) regulations in England, a reasonable excuse will now be expanded to include undertaking several activities in connection with the purchase, sale, letting or rental of a residential property. They include: - Visiting estate or letting agents, developer sales offices or show homes; - Viewing residential properties to look for a property to buy or rent; - Preparing a residential property to move in; - Moving home; - Visiting a residential property to undertake any activities required for the rental or sale of that property. The housing market has nearly ground to a halt in recent weeks. According to property website Zoopla, around 373,000 property transactions across the UK, with a total value of £82bn, have been put on hold due to coronavirus lockdown measures. Here are the main points from the press conference. Downing Street has given up presenting daily figures showing how the UK’s coronavirus death toll compares with other countries’. (See 2.35pm and 5.24pm.) It has not given an official explanation for this yet, but the chart showed the UK ahead of the other European countries featured in terms of total deaths and, as the days progressed, the gap between the UK and its neighbours was getting ever larger. In the past, when ministers have been asked about these figures, they have pointed out that the chart showed total deaths, not deaths per head, and that the comparisons were not necessarily valid because different countries compile data in different ways. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the data at the end of the press conference slide show amounted to a daily reminder that the UK has a poor record to defend. Here are the latest figures from Worldometer, a respected international website, showing the UK with the second highest death toll in the world. And here is an alternative chart from the FT’s John Burn-Murdoch, who has been producing his own global death comparison charts. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said that employers had a duty to keep their staff safe. Responding a question about what workers could do if forced to work in an environment they considered unsafe, he replied: Employers have a duty to keep employees safe in the workplace - that is absolutely enshrined in law. If somebody feels their workplace is not safe, they have to take that up with their employer. If they don’t feel they are getting any traction they absolutely should get in touch with the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority. Sarah Albon, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, said that the “vast majority” of employers wanted to do the right thing to protect their staff. She said workers have already been contacting the HSE with complaints about working conditions. But mostly, where employers were doing the wrong thing, it was because they did not know what to do, she said. She explained: Our experience so far is that it is rather more that employers have not understood the right thing to do than that they are deliberately trying to do the wrong thing. And in the vast majority of cases, when our inspectors have got involved, employers have been only too willing to do the right thing. We’ve been following up every time an employer has told us they’ve made changes, they’ve made an improvement to the workplace, not only with the employer ... but with the original complainant to check that they are now satisfied that their employer has done the right thing. And in the absolute vast majority of those cases, employers have made the right decision, have done the right thing, to the satisfaction of their employees. There are a small number of cases where we are continuing to pursue that further, and we will certainly take enforcement action if that’s required. She also stressed that the HSE can impose sanctions on employers who are not protecting staff. Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things - enforcement notices, requiring them to take particular kinds of action. In the most extreme circumstances if there is a risk of serious injury to an individual employee they can issue a notice which prohibits certain activities from taking place. Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offence and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing. The England and Wales Cricket Board is expected to deliver guidelines on reopening some parts of club and recreational cricket, possibly as early as Wednesday. Cricket was one of the outdoor summer sports overlooked in the government’s new lockdown guidelines, whereas golf, tennis, and angling – more obviously isolated pursuits – were specifically mentioned by the prime minister. Full story here: Police Scotland are urging motorists to drive safely after a number of people were charged in connection with high level speeding offences over the bank holiday weekend. The force revealed that between Friday 8 May and Sunday 10 May, 12 men were detected driving at speeds between 93mph and 111mph around one junction of the M876 near Larbert, a town near Falkirk. The men, aged between 19 and 66, will be reported to the procurator fiscal. Other incidents across Scotland over the weekend included speeds of between 101 and 119mph on the A90 in Aberdeenshire. Reiterating that the stay-at-home message is still in place for Scots, Ch Supt Louise Blakelock, head of road policing said: With the current challenges facing us just now, we need to protect the NHS and save lives, therefore, drivers need to be more cautious and consider other road users. The high speeds detected over the weekend show that despite the clear risks involved a minority of drivers are still willing to take their chance. The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region have written to Boris Johnson to warn that the government’s change of coronavirus message comes “too early” for the north-west of England. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram said they were “concerned about the substance of what was announced” on Sunday. They want the government to publish the ‘R’ reproduction rate at a regional and sub-regional level to enable authorities and people to make informed decisions based on local risk. In a letter sent on Tuesday, they write: Here in the north-west, we experienced the highest number of new cases last week and are not yet on the clear downward trajectory seen in other parts of the country. For that reason, we are concerned that the decision to relax the ‘stay at home’ message may have come too early for the north-west and could expose our residents to higher levels of risk of infection. The mayors also expressed their disappointment over the “lack of meaningful consultation and advance knowledge” of the changes announced on Sunday, which have an “immediate and direct impact” on policing and public transport in the north-west as in other regions. Q: People in places like Lincolnshire are worried about tourists arriving under this week’s new guidelines. What assurances can you give them? And when will tourism resume? Sharma says the new guidelines do not allow people to go and visit places and stay the night. On tourism, he says the government has put in place various measures to help businesses in this sector already. But he says it is vital to avoid a second peak. A second peak would be the worst possible thing for businesses, he says. And that’s it. The press conference is over. Q: You need union cooperation. So will you drop the pledge in your manifesto to curb their powers? Sharma says he has been collaborating with the unions. The government will continue that approach, he says. Q: So do the manifesto pledges remain in place? Sharma says he is focusing on working with the unions to address the coronavirus crisis. Q: What penalties can the HSE impose? Albon says it can use enforcement notices requiring certain activities. It can also prohibit certain actions. If an employer breaches that, that is an offence. Powis says NHS staff are trying to implement the guidelines saying relatives should be able to be with someone dying. He says it will get easier as hospitals become less over-loaded. Q: If an unscrupulous employer tries to make people work in an environment that is not safe, will the government support them if they refuse to work? Sharma says employers have a duty to keep employees safe. That is enshrined in law. If they feel the workplace is not safe, they must take that up. If that does not work, they should go to the HSE. He says the guidance includes contact numbers. He says the HSE will also be conducting spot checks. But he says his impression is that most employers want to do the right thing. Albon says there will be some employers who don’t do the right thing. People have been contacting the HSE already. She says their impression is that, in the vast majority of cases, employers are at fault because they don’t know what the right thing to do is. When told, they mostly comply. In the small number of cases where they don’t, the HSE will take enforcement action, she says. Q: Why does your advice treat people under 70 the same, when people in their 20s are at much less risk than people in their 50s? Sharma says every death is a tragedy. That is why the government advice tries to protect people. Sarah Albon, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, says the guidance for firms makes allowance for who is in the most vulnerable category. Powis says the older people are, the more at risks they are. But age is not the only risk factor. Obesity, underlying health and ethnicity are also factors, he says. Q: At one stage experts were saying there could be between 7,000 and 20,000 deaths. Why did you get it so wrong? Powis says the original reasonable worst case scenario envisaged 500,000 deaths. He says the UK is doing much better than that. Q: What can you do to help care homes stay open? Sharma says the government is providing support to businesses. He acknowledges this is a difficult time. He says the cumulative value of “bounce back” loans is £8bn, and the business interruption loans scheme has paid out £6bn. Q: But care homes don’t need to furlough staff. And their business is not interrupted. Yet they still need help. Sharma says the business support offered is among the best in the world. Here is the hospital data slide. And here is the final slide. The global deaths comparison chart has been abandoned. Downing Street suggested this might happen at the briefing early. The figures were a huge embarrassment to No 10, so perhaps it is not surprising that they have been erased from the daily record. (See 2.35pm.) Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, is now presenting the rest of the slides. He says there are in an “updated format” compared to how they used to be presented. Here is the transport use one. Here is the slide for deaths of those who tested positive for coronavirus And this slide shows deaths where coronavirus was suspected, as well as where it was confirmed. He says this shows the death rate falling, including in care homes. Sharma says the government wants workers to feel safe as they go back to work. Sharma says he thinks he has reached a consensus with unions and business on the guidelines for safe working. (See 10.30am.) The messaging has changed too, Sharma says, as he introduces slide three. The next slide shows the three steps for the way ahead. Sharma is now reminding people of the strategy. He introduces the first slide. It shows the alert levels. Sharma is now reading out the latest testing and death figures. The figures are here. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is here for the daily press conference. Tomorrow the Office for National Statistics will publish its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020. Growth was flat in the final quarter of 2019 and the real impact of the coronavirus crisis is not expected until the second quarter of 2020 (April to June), when GDP could fall by 35%, if the OBR is right. So, technically the UK is not in a recession yet (because economists only define a recession after two quarters of negative growth). But Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, told BBC News that in practice the UK was already in one. In an interview with Laura Kuenssberg, asked if the country was facing a recession, Sunak replied: We already know that many people have lost their jobs and it breaks my heart. We’ve seen what’s happening with universal credit claims already. This is not something that we’re going to wait to see; it’s already happening. There are already businesses that are shutting. There already people who have lost their jobs. And as I said, that’s heartbreaking to me and that’s why I’m working night and day to limit the amount of job losses. Reading and Leeds music festivals have been cancelled due to the pandemic. A statement from the organisers said: We’ve been closely monitoring this unprecedented situation and we were hopeful we could deliver the ultimate festival to you in August, something to look forward to in these strange and confusing times. However, it has become clear that it’s just not possible for this year’s festival to go ahead. We want to extend our gratitude to our teams, artists and partners who work so hard each year. And to our fans, we’re nothing without you - we thank you for your continued support and understanding. More than half of Britons feel down, depressed and hopeless over the future, a pan-European study of mental health during the pandemic has found. The international survey of how the Covid-19 crisis is impacting on mental wellbeing reveals that 57% of UK participants had suffered depression and stress. Overall the three-country investigation concluded that the mental health of 41% of the UK population is at risk as a result of the coronavirus. The study collected data on people in the UK, Spain and Italy between 24 April and 17 May. Just 55 prisoners have been released early under plans to alleviate the Covid-19 crisis in jails in England and Wales for which up to 4,000 prisoners are eligible, a minister has revealed. Lucy Frazer, the justice minister, told the justice select committee that as of 11 May, 21 pregnant women had been released from jail, five prisoners had been freed under the early release scheme and five inmates released on compassionate release. The Ministry of Justice announced on 4 April that up to 4,000 prisoners who were within two months of their release date and had passed a risk assessment would be released. Since the announcement, Public Health England (PHE) modelling has shown the spread of infection and rate of deaths in prison has been much lower than expected. But the containment of the outbreak in prisons has been driven by a highly restrictive regime, which involves increased time in cells, segregation and a ban on all visits, a regime that PHE has said would need to remain in place until April next year. Penal reform campaigners have warned this approach is not sustainable in the long term and further releases are required. Justice committee member, Andy Slaughter MP, said the low number of early releases represented a “missed opportunity”. Here is the official Labour response to the Treasury’s furlough scheme announcement. It’s from the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. The furlough scheme is a lifeline for millions. The government was right not to pull it away. It is welcome that the chancellor has heeded the call by Labour, trade unions, and businesses for more flexibility in the scheme, to support employees to go back to work part-time. The government must clarify today when employers will be required to start making contributions, and how much they’ll be asked to pay. If every business is suddenly required to make a substantial contribution from the 1st August onwards, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies. Rishi Sunak implied in his statement to MPs that firms would start having to make a contribution from August, but the Treasury has not given details. However, sources have been briefing journalists that, even when businesses do start having to make a contribution, the government will continue to meet more than 50% of the cost. These are from the Press Association’s Ian Jones. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, has been looking at the government guidance for physical distancing in schools (see 10.30am) and she is not impressed. In a statement she said: This guidance raises more questions than it answers leaving headteachers and school leaders unable to adequately plan for the reopening of their schools on this basis. There is still no realistic guidance for how social distancing will be kept in place with the age groups that will return first, how staff and families of children will be protected, or how class sizes of 15 will be achieved with the resources schools have. The government must urgently convene education unions and the profession to create a workable plan for the reopening of schools when the science indicates it is safe to do so and which has the confidence of all those affected. The DUP has put out a statement saying, among other things, that the furlough scheme shows the importance of Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom. This is from the DUP MP Sammy Wilson. We have been pressing the chancellor and the prime minister about the need to avoid a cliff edge with the job retention scheme. An extension is the right decision with a direction of travel into the autumn ... This announcement is also a reminder of how important it is for Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom. The Northern Ireland executive could not afford such a significant support scheme. Until recently the DUP might not have felt the need to make a point like this, but since Brexit Irish reunification has become more of a salient issue than it used to be. The SNP has not been making the same argument. It has welcomed the furlough announcement too, but in a statement Alison Thewliss, the SNP Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, said the UK government should maintain the scheme as long as it is needed in Scotland. She said: The scheme must remain in place and fully funded for as long as each of the four nations of the UK require it. People in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland must not be penalised if changes to the lockdown are made at a different pace. Grant Shapps said TfL will only be able to take 15% of usual commuter levels if 100% of services are running and urged everybody to look for “alternative means of transport”. The Tory MP and former transport minister Stephen Hammond said many Londoners who need to get to work will still need to use the tube and rail network. He asked the transport secretary: Can I ask what discussions he’s had with the Mayor of London and with Network Rail about how quickly the London transport system can be returned to full working so that the most social distancing is possible, and also the possibility of introducing temperature scanning at London termini? Shapps replied that ridership on TfL was up by 8% yesterday and urged people to look for alternative means of travelling. He said: I have spoken to, communicated with the Mayor and his Deputy Mayor over the weekend. I am encouraging them and working very closely with TfL to boost those services just as quickly as they can and there’s more to go there. It is worth reiterating, even if those services ran at 100% of pre-Covid levels we would still only be able to take perhaps on the TfL 15% of existing, usual commuter levels – so it is important that everybody looks for alternative means of transport. A further 627 people have died in the UK across all settings, up from 32,065 yesterday, the DHSC said. This is significantly lower than the figures released earlier today by the ONS, which suggested the official death toll has surpassed 40,000. Unlike the government’s daily stats, the ONS figures include all instances where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including cases without a positive test and suspected cases. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the eventual cost of the Treasury’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which pays firms to furlough workers, could be close to £100bn. The Treasury has refused to say what it expects the final cost to be, although insiders have dismissed claims that it will cost £13bn a month as an over-estimate. Another 16 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the death toll there to 1,132, Public Health Wales said. A further 105 positive cases were also reported, bringing that total to 11,573. Northern Rail is to use the collapse in demand for rail travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic to finally retire its entire fleet of Pacer trains. These much-maligned “buses on rails” have become a leaking, squeaking symbol of the underinvestment in northern England in recent years as Northern Rail missed successive deadlines to send them to the railway knacker’s yard. But at a virtual meeting of the Rail North Committee on Tuesday, politicians including Greater Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham were told that no pacers will be on the Northern network from this Saturday (18 May). Not all will go to train heaven, however: a few will be kept for “contingency”. One has already been sent to the National Railway Museum in York and three others were “won” by charities and community groups, which will see the rusty old carriages turned into a men’s cooking school, a science lab for a Bradford primary and a non-clinical space for patients at Airedale general hospital. This weekend the operator (run by the state since March after a disastrous few years in the private sector) looks to increase services from 45% to 63% of normal services. The meeting heard that physical distancing is currently possible on services run by Northern and Transpennine Express as passenger numbers remained at 5% of their normal levels. This is from Water UK, the trade body representing the major water companies in the UK. The prime minister told MPs on Monday it might be possible to track local “flare ups” of coronavirus by testing “the water supply”, which confused and scared many. No 10 quickly issued a clarification that he was referring to sewage or waste water, not the fresh water that comes out of our taps. A total of 42 Transport for London workers have died with Covid-19, the transport secretary said. On Network Rail, including the train operating companies, the number is 10, Shapps told the Commons. He added that it isn’t currently known if this was “through their jobs”. As a precautionary measure, people should wear face coverings on public transport, Shapps said, urging people to think about the needs of others. He told the Commons: [Wearing face coverings on public transport] could help protect other travellers from coronavirus, where someone has perhaps unwittingly or unknowingly developed the illness but they’re not actually showing any symptoms. We urge passengers to avoid the rush hour, re-plan their visits, to use contactless payments where at all possible and to wash their hands before and after their journeys. In his statement to the Commons, Grant Shapps said it was crucial that those who can’t do their jobs from home should travel to work by walking or cycling if possible, or even by car if necessary, in order to avoid public transport. Shapps said: We continue to ask people to only go to work if they cannot do their jobs from home, that’s because even as transport begins to revert to a full service, the 2-metre distancing rule will only leave effective capacity for one-in-10 passengers overall. One in 10. Therefore, it’s crucial that we protect our network by minimising the pressures placed upon it and ensure it’s ready to serve those who most need it. We are actively asking those who need to make journeys to their place of work or other essential trips to walk or to cycle wherever possible. Shapps referred to the government’s £2bn investment related to walking and cycling, adding the first stage worth £250m would include pop-up bike lines, wider pavements and cycling and bus-only corridors. He added: If people cannot walk but have access to a car - and I appreciate that I will be the only transport secretary to have said this for very many years – [if] people have access to a car we urge them to use the car before they consider public transport, avoiding where possible any busy times of day. An attempt to overturn the judiciary’s freeze preventing evictions and home repossessions during the pandemic has been rejected by the court of appeal. Lawyers for an insolvency firm had lodged an emergency application over the alleged failure to pay mortgages on two houses in Hertfordshire which were already the subject of a legal dispute. They challenged an emergency ‘practice direction’, made by the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales, which ensured that no one would lose their homes during the outbreak or be the subject of legal action that could result in them being made homeless. In the hearing last week, Philip Rainey QC, acting for Mehmet Arkin, an insolvency practitioner, argued that the rules were ‘ultra vires’ - having not been made in accordance with the law. But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, dismissed the appeal. Giving the court’s reason on Monday, he said: The short delay to possession litigation enshrined in [practice direction] PD 51Z is amply justified by the exceptional circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. ...There is a need to ensure that neither the administration of justice nor the enforcement of possession orders endanger public health by the unnecessary transmission of the virus. PD 51Z creates no risk that persons will ‘effectively be prevented from having access to justice’... He added: The blanket stay has been imposed to protect public health and the administration of justice generally. The approach of a blanket stay reflects the balance struck by the Master of the Rolls, and makes clear that possession claims are not to be dealt with on a normal case by case basis during the stay. We would strongly deprecate parties troubling the court with applications that are based only on such reasons and which are in truth bound to fail. Transport is undoubtedly going to “play a very central role” in the UK’s “gradual” recovery from the pandemic, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has told MPs. Making a statement in the Commons on Covid-19 guidance for transport users and operators, he said: It will be the key to restarting our economy ... our nation’s emergence from this crisis will not be a single leap to freedom, it will be a gradual process. Outlining the two new pieces of guidance, he added: We remain clear that those who can work from home should continue to do so. However, as those who cannot start to return to their jobs, the safety of the public and of the transport workers must be paramount. There have been a further nine deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said, bringing the total related fatalities there to 447. In a Commons statement earlier this afternoon, the business secretary Alok Sharma said he believed “consensus” had been reached in developing guidance on how firms should safely reopen. He told MPs: As we return to work, the government wants to give employers and workers confidence that their workplaces will be safe for them to return to because we recognise this is an anxious time for many. This includes ensuring people work from home if they can, but he added: For those who cannot work from home and whose workplace has not been told to close, our message is clear - you should go to work. Staff should speak to their employer about when the workplace will open. On the use of face masks, Sharma said it is an “option” for workers but is “not required by law in the workplace”. The owners of Hampstead Heath have ruled out reopening bathing ponds in the park despite Boris Johnson’s pledge to allow outdoor swimming. But a return to bathing in Hyde Park’s Serpentine lake is being considered. The Corporation of London, which runs the north London park, said it could not reopen its three swimming ponds or its Lido and maintain physical distancing rules. The Royal Parks, which runs Hyde Park, said it is reviewing whether it can reopen the park’s Serpentine lake for swimming in a way that is safe and allows for physical distancing. The prime minister was challenged in the Commons on Monday to say more about swimming by the Tory MP Desmond Swayne, a well-known wild swimmer who regularly bathes in the Serpentine. Johnson said: We’ve all lived so far with onerous restrictions on outdoor spaces and exercise. Unfortunately we can’t do anything for swimming pools, but we can do something for lakes and the sea. This is where we can go significantly, further, because there is a lower risk outdoors than indoors. But there is no mention of swimming in the government’s road map on easing the lockdown. And it said ticketed outdoor venues will remain closed. It says: “ You will still not be able to use areas like playgrounds, outdoor gyms or ticketed outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. Screening hospital workers for Covid-19 is crucial researchers have stressed after a study in a Cambridge hospital found 3% of more than 1,000 staff without symptoms and who turned up for work had the virus. (See 1.03pm.) The study, published in the journal e-Life, reports how healthcare workers at Addenbrookes hospital were tested over the course of April for the disease, revealing 3% of those reporting for duty tested positive, with 17 of the 30 truly asymptomatic or showing very few, mild symptoms. Others who tested positive had symptoms more than a week before the test, during which most had self-isolated. The team behind the study, which includes researchers at Public Health England, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, the National Institutes for Health Research and the University of Cambridge, said the work suggests up to 15,000 NHS workers across the UK could have been working while infected during April - possibly more due to PPE shortages. Prof Daniel Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research, said the study showed why more testing is necessary. He said: Most of all, it enables [the authors] to make the really key point that focus on testing symptomatic cases poses an actual risk of missing the significant spread of infection by people who have no clue they’re infected. This has such enormous implications for how we move forward in our hospitals and care homes. Prof Charles Swanton of the Crick Institute in London, who has previously spoken out on the need for testing in hospitals, agreed, noting many studies have shown the coronavirus can be transmitted by both infected individuals before symptoms occur and by asymptomatic infected individuals. The new study, he said, suggested that in each hospital there could a significant number of healthcare workers who could be transmitting the virus to both their colleagues and to patients. “There is really a very clear mandate based on this study and several other studies over the last two, three months to initiate healthcare worker testing at scale to keep hospitals Covid protected,” he told the Guardian. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister’s spokesman refused to confirm that the government remained committed to publishing its usual daily slides, including the global deaths comparison chart. The government did publish slides yesterday, but not the usual ones including a slide showing a global deaths and another showing transport use. The spokesman said he could not say whether these slides would be used again. The government would be showing slides about the roadmap to recovery, he said. The transport use slide was moderately awkward for the government because last week it showed a small but steady increase in people travelling at a time when that was not being encouraged. Here is the one from Saturday last week. But ministers were particularly embarrassed by the global deaths comparison chart. Even though it compares countries that compile their figures in different ways, and it gives total deaths not deaths per head, it looked damning because it showed the UK as having the worst death rate in Europe - and, as the days went on, this became more prominent. Here is the chart from Saturday. The spokesman backed what Matt Hancock said this morning about how foreign holidays this summer might not be possible. He said that the current advice was against travelling abroad apart from for essential reasons. Those reasons did not include holidays, he said. The spokesman confirmed that the government was committed to having 18,000 contact tracers in place by the week commencing 18 May. Expanding on what the PM said about this target in the Commons yesterday, the spokesman said: We have had 15,000 people expressing interest. That’s 15,000 health care professionals expressing interest in supporting the training programme. We are starting to get them trained. We are confident that we will have 18,000 staff available from the week commencing May 18. That’s a mix of call handlers and health staff. So, 15,000 of those are call handlers and around 3,000 health staff. The spokesman said that work was ongoing to look at how sewage could be used to map the spread of coronavirus through the country. Asked to elaborate on what Boris Johnson said about this yesterday, the spokesman said that water companies are working with universities in mapping the spread of coronavirus by examining sewage. He said Water UK had issued a statement on this, saying that non-infectious traces of coronavirus can remain in sewage. NHS England has announced 350 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 23,709. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 350 new deaths announced today, 44 occurred on 11 May, 90 occurred on 10 May and 44 occurred on 9 May. It was Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and arguably the most powerful figure on the Labour left. (See 2.04pm.) He does not normally put out press releases complimenting Conservative governments, but he represents workers, and he has warmly welcomed the extension of the furlough scheme. Here is his statement in full. The chancellor’s announcement will be a welcome relief to households across the country. The job retention scheme is as crucial to battling and defeating this virus as the public health measures that we have also been campaigning for. Of course, we’ll need to look at the detail when it is published but today’s announcement is a message again to employers that the government will stand behind them if they stand behind their workers. There should be no rush to redundancies. Politics Live does not normally go in for quizzes, but have a guess who said this, about the Sunak announcement. Today’s announcement is a message again to employers that the government will stand behind them if they stand behind their workers. The answer’s coming in a minute or two, when I’ve written up the full post. Foreign holidays are likely to be cancelled this year, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warned this morning, as he said the public need to prepare for the “reality of life” in a period of physical distancing. Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor have the story. Nicola Sturgeon asked employers north of the border to follow Scottish government guidelines, reiterating that measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are not applicable in Scotland. Speaking at her daily press briefing, the first minister said: I am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis – so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge employees back prematurely. She added that she recognised it was not an option for everyone to work from home and that if the Scottish government were to advise people to return to work then it was “absolutely incumbent” on them to ensure that they were safe in the workplace. She welcomed Rishi Sunak’s extension of the furlough scheme to October, saying that she hoped this would avoid any cliff edge scenario for employers. She was also questioned about BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme, which revealed on Monday evening that the public was not told about an early coronavirus outbreak at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February. (See 9.31am.) She insisted that “all appropriate steps were taken” to protect public health, including setting up an incident management team and contact tracing, but added that patient confidentiality meant small numbers of cases could not be publicly identified at that time, but that they were included in the regular NHS reporting system. But reporters pointed out that the first positive case recorded for the Edinburgh area was on 7 March, 10 days after the conference. This is from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The Welsh health minister has insisted that he did not break the lockdown at the weekend after he was photographed out and about with his family. Vaughan Gething tweeted: At the Welsh government’s daily press conference he said: I went for a walk with my family as many of us have done over the weekend. My son was on his scooter. We went local to ourselves. We stopped for food on the way. All of those things are within the regulations. There’s absolutely no breach of the guidance or the rules. It’s really disappointing in the middle of a global pandemic when more than 1,100 people have lost their lives in Wales and more to come and difficult complex choices to be made every day to have a deliberately unhelpful inquiry from a journalist from a national newspaper who wants to suggest I have done something wrong when I haven’t. I think that all of us need to be better than this. There’s not a single thing that that journalist is proposing to write that would help save a single life or would help the public with the key message about continuing to follow the lockdown rules. This is from Carys Roberts, executive director of the IPPR thinktank, on the decision to extend the furlough scheme until the end of October. Citizens Advice has responded to the chancellor’s announcement, saying the furlough extension protects households from a financial cliff edge, but people in the shielded group need a right to access the scheme if they can’t work safely. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive, said: Extending the furlough scheme and allowing employers to bring back their workers part-time are sensible steps to protect household finances. The Job Retention Scheme was an unprecedented intervention which has protected jobs and put money in people’s pockets. We have made clear that changes to the scheme would be needed to make sure people don’t face a financial cliff edge. Sadly, we continue to see cases where people in the shielded group are being denied furlough. People in this group need a right to access this scheme if they cannot work safely. Nobody should be forced to choose between paying the bills or protecting their health. And this is from Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s Treasury spokeswoman at Westminster. Wolves are the first club to get Covid-19 testing under the Premier League’s testing plan ahead of the potential resumption of matches. More than 10 members of backroom staff were swabbed on Monday, with plans to test players later this week and at regular intervals thereafter. Full story here: This is from John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, on Sunak’s announcement. This is from Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, on Sunak’s announcement about extending the furlough scheme. The Welsh government will not recommend that its citizens wear face masks. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, had considered the evidence and discussed it with the chief medical officers from the other UK nations. Gething said: He [Atherton] is not recommending that everyone should be wearing face masks; he believes this should be a matter of personal choice. The minister said his government is “concerned” at the different tone from the UK government on the easing of exercise restrictions in England. Ministers are worried people may be tempted to travel from England to visit Welsh beauty spots, which would break the lockdown rules in Wales. Gething said: We think the messaging in England is confused. But he said he did not think closing the border was a “real option”. He said such a move would involve erecting border controls and he was not sure the Welsh government had the power to take such action. He said: What really matters is policing and enforcing the laws, the regulations. Gething also made it clear that it was not acceptable to play golf in Wales – because it usually involves driving to the course. During defence questions in the Commons, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, asked the defence secretary Ben Wallace to summon “an urgent meeting of the National Security Council” which has not met since January to discuss threats from China and Russia at the time of coronavirus. No meeting is also scheduled to take place this week either, as this Guardian report points out, and there are growing concerns in Whitehall that the national security council which met weekly under David Cameron and Theresa May is being allowed to wither. In reply, Wallace said that the decision to call an NSC is “is a matter for the national security directorate within the Cabinet Office and the cabinet and the prime minister”. He added: “It is not the case that by not having it we have no agenda on security.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told the Commons during defence questions that he had offered further military help with the coronavirus crisis in care homes in a morning meeting with Boris Johnson. The cabinet minister told MPs that he wanted to offer care homes “the assistance they need” in “bringing testing to care homes”, or helping with the decontamination of facilities so staff don’t risk bringing the disease to and from the homes during their work. No indication was given as to whether the prime minister had accepted the offer, but Wallace said “we stand ready” to help the Department of Health and Social Care or any other stakeholder as required, as the number of deaths and infections amongst those in care remains high. The BBC’s economics editor, Faisal Islam, says some Conservative thinkers believe a version of the furlough scheme could be with us for good. A study of staff at an NHS hospital has suggested that 3% of staff reporting as fit for duty in April were unknowingly infected with coronavirus. Researchers at Cambridge University swabbed and tested more than 1,200 NHS workers at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge throughout April, with staff also asked about relevant coronavirus symptoms. More than 1,000 workers reported that they were fit for duty during the study period, but 3% of them tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Mike Weekes, one of the authors of the report, said staff need to be tested regularly “regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms”. Under closer questioning as part of the study, around one in five staff reported no symptoms, two in five had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported Covid-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously. Weekes and his fellow senior author, Prof Stephen Baker, from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease, said hospitals needed to introduce screening programmes across their workforces. Weekes said: Test! Test! Test! And then test some more. All staff need to get tested regularly for Covid-19, regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms – this will be vital to stop infection spreading within the hospital setting. The study, published in the journal eLife, also explored possible routes of transmission of the virus through the hospital and among staff. Researchers looked at whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in “red” areas of the hospital, caring for Covid-19 patients. Despite wearing appropriate PPE, “red” area staff were three times more likely to test positive than staff working in Covid-19-free “green” areas, the study indicated. It is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of transmission from patients to staff in red areas, as staff may have instead transmitted the virus to each other or acquired it at home. Those working in the “red” areas were also swabbed earlier in the study, closer to when the lockdown was first initiated, so the higher rates of infection in this group might just be a symptom of higher rates of virus circulating in the community at the time. Employers have welcomed the announcement to extend the furlough scheme too. This is from Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. A furlough extension will bring significant relief to employers and workers across the country. We’re delighted the Treasury has taken on the IoD’s consistent calls for a flexible furlough. Many firms will be operating far below normal capacity for the foreseeable future. A part-time furlough provides a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed. A more flexible approach will allow firms to raise activity levels in tandem with demand, helping to avoid cashflow challenges. The TUC has welcomed Sunak’s announcement. This is from Frances O’Grady, its general secretary. We are pleased ministers have listened to unions and extended the job retention scheme to the autumn. This will be a big relief for millions. Changing the rules to allow part-time working is key to enabling a gradual and safe return to work. And maintaining the rate at 80% is a win for the pay packets of working families. As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job. The Conservative MP Cheryl Gillan says British Airways has been threatening to make staff redundant, even though it has been using the furlough scheme. She asks Sunak to condemn this. Sunak says the government will continue to do all it can to protect jobs. In response to a question from Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, about help for the self-employed, Sunak says the scheme already operating for the self-employed is one of the most generous in the world. People will start getting help through it from early next week. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has announced a significant rise in suspected cases of Covid-19 in hospitals overnight – a rise of 165 taking the total of those in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 to 1,618. She emphasised that this increase related to suspected rather than confirmed cases and could well be explained by the new policy of testing older people in hospital. She also announced 15 more deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 1,912. These are from Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank focusing on living standards and inequality. Bell, who used to work as a Labour adviser, welcomes Sunak’s decision. In the Commons Sunak seems to have taken MPs by surprise by the scale of his announcement. MPs from all sides have welcomed his decision, and opposition MPs are finding it hard to ask the usual “But why aren’t you doing X as well?” follow-ups. These are from Rishi Sunak summarising his announcement. In the Commons Sunak confirms that the level of support to employees will not be reduced. But employers will be asked to contribute more. He says today’s announcement means the scheme will have run for eight months. In response to his Labour shadow, Anneliese Dodds, Sunak says he has never talked about people being addicted to this scheme. That is not language he backs, he says. And he says he has been consulting with unions about this. Sunak says the government believes in the dignity of work. It is doing all it can to protect people who cannot work. He says he can announce the next stage of the job retention scheme, the furlough scheme. He says 7.5m jobs have been supported, and almost 1m businesses helped. He says the scheme will be extended for four months, until the end of October. (It had been due to end at the end of June.) There will be no changes until the end of July. And in August, September and October it will continue with more flexibility. He says employers will be able to bring workers back part-time. (At the moment the scheme only subsidises workers who are not working at all.) He says the government will require employers to make a contribution. But he says employees will continue to get the same support they do now - 80% of wages. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is now responding to an urgent question in the Commons about the future of his furlough scheme. In his TV address on Sunday night Boris Johnson said that the reproduction number, R, for the UK as a whole was between 0.5 and 0.9. This shows the rate at which coronavirus is spreading. The government’s key priority is to keep it below 1. The Northern Ireland executive has a more specific estimate for R in Northern Ireland. According to its recovery plan document (pdf), it is currently around 0.8. England’s national parks have urged caution for visitors planning to return to beauty spots from Wednesday – with some still telling people to stay away. Updated government rules on the lockdown have relaxed the “stay local” message in England so people can drive to outdoor open spaces “irrespective of distance”, as long as they respect physical distancing guidance and don’t cross borders. However, several national parks are warning people to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid hotspots or busy areas. Visitors are also being warned that many facilities, such as car parks, visitor centres and public toilets, as well as cafes and pubs, are not yet open. The Lake District is urging people not to return yet in order to help communities in Cumbria, which officials said has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the UK. The National Park Authority chief executive, Richard Leafe, said: For now, we’re asking people not to rush back to the Lake District – help protect our communities, the fells will still be here when this passes. The Yorkshire Dales NPA’s chief executive, David Butterworth, said the government’s approach to reopening the countryside was not one it had advocated: We, along with many organisations with countryside facilities, have advocated a staged approach with an initial ‘stay local’ message to avoid unnecessary travel and minimise any tension between visitors and local communities. But in light of the new rules, authority-run car parks would now be opened and it was working to open toilets as soon as possible, he said, as he asked visitors to respect local communities, nature and other people. Dartmoor national park said it was reviewing how to reopen car parks and toilets and was awaiting further guidance on how to do so while safely supporting social distancing. In a statement it added: Until then please stay at home, avoid unnecessary journeys, exercise locally and follow social distancing and hygiene rules. And Sarah Fowler, the chief executive of the Peak District NPA, issued a personal appeal for anyone planning to travel to the area: Before your journey, carefully consider your own wellbeing and that of the Peak District’s many small communities. Continuing to use local parks and outdoor areas close to home could help the park ensure it can welcome visitors in the coming weeks and not put “undue pressure” on public highways, emergency access or key workers, she added. The UK death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 40,000, according to official figures, with almost 10,000 care home residents now having died from coronavirus, Robert Booth and Caelainn Barr report. Here is an excerpt from the Northern Ireland’s executive’s document (pdf) showing what its five-step plan looks like. The Northern Ireland executive has just published its own coronavirus recovery plan. The 12-page document is here (pdf), and there is a seven-page summary here (pdf). It envisages a five-step route to recovery. PA Media summarises them here. The first step includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis. The second step will see groups of 10 being able to meet outdoors, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups, re-opening of some libraries and open-air museums, as well as indoor activities involving limited contact of less than 10 minutes and with two to four people. The third step will see groups of up to 30 being able to gather outside, re-opening of more libraries as well as museums and galleries, concert and theatre rehearsals resuming and larger indoor gatherings. The fourth step is set to see socially distanced church services, resumption of competitive sport behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, leisure centres re-opening and outdoor concerts resuming on a restricted basis. The fifth step will include the resumption of close physical contact sports, return of competitive sport, spectators at live events on a restricted basis as well as the re-opening of nightclubs and concerts on a limited basis. However the NI executive has not included dates for when each step of the plan might be reached and warned this will take “significant time”. And here is an extract from the plan. It says: The executive shares the aspiration of all of you - to return to a more normal way of living our lives soon. While this will take significant time, we can guarantee that we will not retain the restrictions for any longer than is absolutely necessary,” the document reads. However it is important that when taking decisions now, we recognise the risk of having to re-introduce restrictions if cases rise sharply again. That is why we will only decide to relax restrictions when we are sure that that is in the long-term interest of the health and wellbeing of the population. Tributes have been paid to an ambulance care assistant who died with coronavirus and who “dedicated his career to serving the public”. Phil Rennie, a patient transport service care assistant for the North West ambulance service based in Oldham, contracted Covid-19 and died at Fairfield general hospital in Bury on Sunday, the service’s chief executive, Daren Mochrie, said: Phil was extremely proud to work for NWAS, offering comfort and care to those in need. He has been part of the NWAS family since 2015 and has dedicated his career to serving the public, previously working in local authority and public services. We have been supporting Phil’s family during this terrible time and they are in the thoughts of everyone here at NWAS - our deepest sympathies go out to them. Phil will be sorely missed by us all. Phil is survived by his wife, Karen, and son, Adam. Boris Johnson would like some primary school children in England to start going back to school from 1 June. Under the provisional plan published yesterday, subject to coronavirus being brought further under control, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils (the youngest and oldest at primary school) would start going back from 1 June, with all primary school pupils back for a month before the summer holidays. But would parents comply? This morning the National Education Union has published the results of a survey of 1,000 parents which suggests that a third of them are not ready to send their children back. According to the NEU, “just under half (49%) said they would, with a third of the total sample (33%) intending to delay the return.” And one parent in that category is Anneliese Dodds, the new shadow chancellor. Dodds, who has a six-year-old and a younger child, was on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour this morning and she was asked if she would be willing to send her oldest back to school on 1 June. At first she gave an evasive answer, saying that her local school was doing “an incredible job” but that the government had not yet published evidence showing it would be safe for children to go back without posting a risk to families and children. Towards the end of the interview the presenter, Jane Garvey, challenged her again, saying she had not answered the question. Would she send her child to school knowing what she does now? Dodds replied: I would be more than happy to send my own child to school if I knew that by doing so I would not be potentially harming others. That’s the critical issue for me. And we don’t have that evidence, I feel, currently. So that’s a no, Garvey suggested. Dodds replied: Well, I don’t feel that I have that evidence now. If government was able to provide that, particularly to publish the scientific information underlying its decisions, we could be in a different situation. As I say, it’s not really about my family. It’s about whether we are spreading this disease more broadly. We don’t have that evidence in front of us now. Some late-morning joy. A doctor who had to miss his daughter’s first birthday due to the coronavirus pandemic said he was “blown away” by the love and kindness of his “incredible” colleagues after they surprised him with a party at the hospital to help celebrate. Dr Rory Nolan, 29, hasn’t seen his wife, Catriona, 26, and daughter Francesca for more than two months after they made the decision to temporarily live apart so he could continue working on the frontline in A&amp;E. Instead of being able to share Francesca’s birthday with her, he spent it working at a Manchester hospital. However, his colleagues stepped in to make sure the day was memorable. Here are some extracts of the thread he posted on Twitter: The doctor also took the opportunity to warn the public that despite the easing of restrictions this week, “Covid is not over” and urged people to follow the rules, if not for themselves then for the sake of others. Care home deaths accounted for about 40% of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending 1 May, with at least 10,535 of all deaths to date taking place outside hospitals, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Of the 6,035 deaths linked to Covid-19 and registered in the week ending 1 May, 2,423 (40%) were in care homes, compared with 3,214 (53%) in hospitals. This weekly number of care home deaths is a slight dip from 2,794 in the previous seven days and is the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March, according to the ONS. The ONS numbers are based on instances where Covid-19 is mentioned anywhere on a death certificate, including in combination with other health conditions. Of all deaths involving coronavirus up to 1 May, 22,873 took place in hospitals, while 10,535 were elsewhere. Of these: - 8,312 took place in care homes - 1,562 were in private homes - 386 occurred in hospices - 142 took place in other communal establishments - 133 happened elsewhere The ONS figures, by date of death, suggest a peak in daily care home deaths may have taken place on 17 April, when 415 deaths occurred. During the following week, daily deaths declined consecutively for all days but one – 22 April, when deaths rose by 20. The corresponding peak for deaths in hospitals is 8 April, when 983 occurred. In the week ending 1 May, there were 17,953 deaths registered across England and Wales – a decrease for the second week running. However, Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the ONS, said this is still around 8,000 deaths above the average for this time of year (see 9.50am.). Speaking to BBC News, he said: That is about 4,000 lower than it was the week before but it is still 8,000 above the average that we would expect to see in this week at this time of year. So it is actually the seventh highest weekly total since this data set started in 1993, so we have had four out of the top seven weeks in the last four weeks. Separate analysis shows there were 8,314 deaths in care homes involving coronavirus reported by care home providers in England to the Care Quality Commission between 10 April and 8 May, according to the ONS. Good morning. I’m Lucy Campbell, joining the blog for the rest of the day. We will be bringing you all the latest updates and analysis on the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, so please do feel free to get in touch throughout the day to share news tips, advice, comments and suggestions. Your ideas are always welcome and apologies if I can’t reply to you all. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Further outbreaks of coronavirus and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions and send people in England back to work without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists has warned. The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic. Prof King set up the “independent Sage” meetings amid concerns around the transparency of independent scientific advice reaching ministers through the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). In a report being published today, the group warns that simply ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed is “counter-productive” and “potentially dangerous”. Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections “we shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics and face the prospect of further partial or national lockdowns”, the authors write. The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee. The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19, and to replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group call for a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of the outbreak control. The report states that the “over-dependence on outsourcing” is unsustainable. On the Today programme this morning Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should not scale back the coronavirus job retention scheme that allows workers to be furloughed. He said the government should continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries (as it does now, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month), instead of reducing that to 60%, as the Treasury has been considering. Asked what Sunak should do, King said: Keep it at 80%. I don’t think it makes sense to regard this as the major cost of the Covid-19 crisis in economic terms. These payments under government schemes are transfers from taxpayers in general to businesses, it will lead to an increase in national debt [but] we can finance that over a long period, particularly given the very low level of long-term real interest rates. The real cost of this shutdown is not measured by the impact on the public finances but by the lost incomes and outputs in the economy, a cost which is likely to end up as an order of magnitude [though no one can really know this] of several hundred billion pounds. That’s an enormous cost. King also said the “economy ought to have recovered to a very large extent” before Sunak considered ending the furlough scheme in a bid to avoid a wave of redundancies when the support is curtailed. BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme has revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh in February, well before the first confirmed cases in the country, but that this was not disclosed to the public. Scotland’s first confirmed coronavirus case, in Tayside, was announced on 1 March, but Disclosure, broadcast on Monday night, revealed an outbreak that began the week before, on 26 and 27 February, at a conference of international delegates for the sportswear company Nike. At least 25 people linked to this event have since been confirmed to have been infected, said the programme, eight of them resident in Scotland. Nike told the BBC it instigated enhanced measures, including contact tracing and increased cleaning and disinfection processes in their stores and offices, and that all its staff had now recovered. The Scottish government confirmed health authorities were alerted to the potential outbreak on 2 March. Over the last 24 hours the government has published a huge pile of documents giving advice to the public about what it needs to do now. The UK government has a three-step coronavirus recovery plan. The step one measures apply from tomorrow (13 May). Step two will start on Monday 1 June, or later. And step three will start on Saturday 4 July or later. The advice out this week covers all three steps, although there is more detail about step one. Much of the advice specifically covers just England. The devolved administrations have also been producing their own guidance. Here are the key documents: The 60-page overall plan, entitled “Our plan to rebuild” (pdf). The coronavirus outbreak FAQs - A useful Q&amp;A covering all main topics, and mostly focusing on what is changing this week. Specific guidance on social distancing. Specific guidance on staying safe outside the home. On education specifically, there are at least four documents. They are: A general guide for parents and carers. Specific information about the plan for some pupils to return to school from 1 June. Advice for schools on what they need to do. Specific advice on protective measures. The Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy has produced eight separate guides on how to keep employees safe in different workplace environment. You can find links to all eight here. And now, this morning, the Department for Transport has produced transport guidance. There are two main documents: Guidance for passengers. Guidance for operators. (If I’ve left any out, please let me know in the comments below the line.) Public transport users should face away from each other when they cannot keep a 2-metre gap, the government has said. A report from PA Media on the new transport guidance issued by the government this morning (see 9.28am) goes on: New guidance issued by the Department for Transport on how to travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak states that passengers should minimise the time they spend near other people and avoid physical contact with them. It acknowledges that “there may be situations where you can’t keep a suitable distance from people”, such as on busier services or at peak times. The document states: “In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.” It goes on: “The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.” Transport operators are being urged to rearrange, remove or limit seating “to try and ensure social distancing is observed”. This may include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating. Single users of black cabs and minicabs should sit in the back left-hand seat of cars, according to the guidance. The sandwich chain Subway has today started a phased reopening of around 600 of its 2,600 stores across the UK and Ireland – approximately one in four – for takeway and delivery only. The outlets have all been fitted with new operational and social distancing safety measures to protect customers, third-party delivery and supplier drivers and staff. These have been tested in the small number of stores that have remained open to support and serve key workers and hospital staff. All NHS workers will receive 25% off their orders, in addition to other initiatives which include free delivery on all third-party orders over £10. The chain joins KFC, Pret a Manger and Burger King in reopening stores, and McDonald’s is poised to trial 15 outlets for delivery from tomorrow. The Office for National Statistics has just published its latest weekly death figures for England and Wales. They go up to the week ending Friday 1 May (or week 18, as the ONS calls it). The ONS figures lag behind the daily figures published by the government, because they are based on registered deaths. But they are more comprehensive. The daily government figures just count people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. The ONS figures for coronavirus deaths include all those where it was mentioned on the death certificate, which often happens if a patient had symptoms but did not test positive. The figures show that by the end of April coronavirus deaths were falling, but total excess deaths (ie, the number of weekly deaths above what you would expect in an average week) was still very high. Here are the main points. Excess deaths in England and Wales were running at around 8,000 at the end of April. There were 8,012 more deaths in week 18 than the five-year average for that time of year. Overall there were 17,953 deaths that week. In the previous week there were 11,539 excess deaths. For the second week in a row overall deaths were down. Coronavirus deaths in week 18 accounted for 33.6% of all deaths, down from 37.4% in the previous weeks. Deaths in care homes were also down in week 18. There were 6,409. But 37.8% of those deaths involved coronavirus, up from 35.3% the previous week. All regions showed a decrease in the proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in week 18. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has just published the new advice being issued to passengers using public transport. It’s here. A railway ticket office worker has died of Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty, as a union calls for a government compensation scheme for bereaved families of frontline employees to be extended to cover transport staff. Belly Mujinga, 47, was on the concourse of Victoria station in London in March when a man who said he had Covid-19 spat and coughed at her and a colleague. Within days of the assault, both women fell ill with coronavirus. Mujinga, who had underlying respiratory problems, was admitted to Barnet Hospital and put on a ventilator but died on 5 April, her trade union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), said. Just 10 people were allowed to attend her funeral. The union has reported the incident to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail (ORR), for investigation and is taking legal advice on the situation. TSSA says there are questions to answer as to why Mujinga was not stood down from duty earlier given her underlying health condition. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: “We are shocked and devastated at Belly’s death. She is one of far too many frontline workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, recently announced that £60,000 would be paid to the survivors of health and care workers who die as a result of the pandemic. Our view is that this compensation should be extended to the families of all frontline workers who perish trying to keep our country and vital services going. Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them. However, there are serious questions about her death; it wasn’t inevitable. As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category, and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why she wasn’t stood down from frontline duties early on in this pandemic. In an interview with Sky News, Mujinga’s husband, Lusamba Gode Katalay, said: “They weren’t given masks, or gloves, so they were exposed to everyone. “It’s her employer, the company and the state who have to look at that. Me and Ingrid [his 11-year-old daughter] we saw Belly, on 2 April when she left for hospital. Then we didn’t see her again. “She’s dead and we buried her without being able to see her.” Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. It’s going to be a busy day. Here are the main items on the agenda. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes its latest weekly death figures. 9.30am: Health and Safety Executive officials give evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee about workplace safety. 11.30am: The Northern Ireland executive publishes its plan for relaxing the lockdown. 12pm: The “independent Sage” convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King publishes its recommendations to government. 12.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs about his plans to extend the furlough scheme. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily press briefings. 1pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 1.15pm: Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about safety guidance for businesses. After 2pm: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about safety guidance for those operating public transport. 2.30pm: Prison Service officials and the prisons minister Lucy Frazer give evidence to the Commons justice committee. 5pm: Sharma is expected to take the UK government’s daily press conference. The number of people dying in care homes has nearly halved in the past few weeks, according to Matt Hancock as he rejected the accusations that the adult and social care sector is being let down by the government. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I’m really pleased that the number of people dying in care homes is now falling, quite sharply. The number has almost halved over the past two to three weeks, since the peak. It’s very clear to me that the transmission in care homes is coming down and is much lower than it was. It comes as new figures are set to be released on care home fatalities, with the Office for National Statistics previously revealing that there were 5,890 coronavirus-related care home deaths registered up to 24 April in England and Wales. Meanwhile, yesterday figures were released showing that women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles. Defending the government’s role in handling the crisis in care homes, Hancock added: Some of our most vulnerable people live in care homes and yet only around a quarter of the deaths that have happened have been in care homes. That’s much lower than most international comparators. Matt Hancock has defended new rules that allow people to meet one parent but not both at the same time, as he rejected claims the new lockdown measures had sowed confusion. For the first time since the lockdown was imposed in March, from tomorrow people will be able to meet a single member from another household in a public place so long as they maintain physical distancing. However, the new rules prevent a person from meeting both parents at the same time. Asked what was wrong with someone seeing both their parents so long as they were 2 metres apart, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: These things are a judgment and what we don’t want is large groups of people gathering and you have to make a judgment as to what is reasonable and where to set the rules. And it’s perfectly reasonable to have a rule that only one individual can meet up with one other at that 2 metre distance, and outside is safer than inside because the science is clear that outside, although the risks are not zero, there is a lower risk to people being approximate outside. Therefore, a rule that you can only meet up with one other person just protects everybody against that burgeoning into large groups of people. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the reproduction rate of Covid-19 in the UK is “broadly in the middle of the range” of 0.5 to 0.9, insisting it is definitely below one. Speaking in an earlier interview on Sky News, Hancock said cleaners entering people’s homes should exercise social distancing rules and follow other good practices, such as washing their hands regularly. Challenged on why grandparents could not see their grandchildren but children could see their carers, Hancock said it was a “scientific fact” that older people were more vulnerable to Covid-19. He added: The principles are really clear and the public has been sensible so far. The Great British public have really understood what social distancing means, why we need to do it … the principles are: outside is better than inside, stay 2 metres away, wash your hands and clean the surfaces, and see as few people as you can outside of your household because that virus spreads but we do also at the same time need to get people back to work.” The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, has called for the government’s furlough scheme to continue, saying: “It can’t be reduced.” The economy would not recover if people were forced back to work too soon, Rayner said, arguing that it should go on “as long as we need it”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: We can’t afford not to do it correctly. I think it is really important the chancellor continues with the good practice of making sure that furlough scheme is in place and doesn’t try and reduce it too soon, because that will cost us in the longer term. Many families wouldn’t be able to survive right now if it wasn’t for things like the furlough scheme. It is absolutely right the government has stepped in but they can’t now pull the rug from underneath people’s feet - they have to continue to support people throughout this crisis. We will have to look at how the economy recovers, but it is not going to recover quickly enough if we pull the rug from people now and people end up destitute and we end up having that R rate spiking again and back in lockdown. Later today, chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme under which the government has been subsidising the wages of workers temporarily laid off due to the pandemic. Matt Hancock has dodged questions on whether people have a legal right not to work if they do not feel safe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There are major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, and industry figures have said the mental health impacts of returning to a new “alien environment” are not being prioritised. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether or not someone has a legal right not to go to work if they do not feel their workplace is safe, Hancock declined to give a direct answer twice. Asked the first time, he replied: Well this needs to be a collaborative effort. Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important … Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home because obviously that’s the safest way to work. Pressed again on whether they would have a legal right not to work if they felt unsafe, he said: “Well, employment law has not changed but that isn’t the point. The point is that businesses and their employees should be working together … to make the best of what is a very difficult situation.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has rejected the idea that meeting a friend in someone’s garden is safer than doing so in a park, as he sought to defend the new lockdown easing measures set to come into force tomorrow. From Wednesday, people will be able to meet one member from a different household in a public place at two metres distance for the first time since the lockdown was imposed. But the minister rejected a viewer’s suggestion that it was safer to meet a friend in their garden rather than a busy park. The viewer’s question, which was read out to Hancock on BBC Breakfast said: “Can I have a friend round in my garden if we stay two metres apart, surely it’s more safe than meeting them in a park with more people?” But Hancock fired back: “It’s not necessarily more safe than meeting in a park and we’ve said that that should only happen in public places…” Asked why it is not as safe, Hancock continued: For instance, lots of people can only get to their garden by going through their house, being with people indoors is not as safe as outdoors and so that’s why we’ve come to this judgment. And it is a balanced judgment that that is best done in a park or in a public place. We brought that in so that people can see others from outside their household but also without encouraging large groups to gather and encouraging things that the scientists tell us would increase the risk of the spread of the virus. Ryanair has announced a plan to restore 40% of its flights from 1 July but warned the move was dependent on EU flight restrictions being lifted, as well as public health measures imposed at airports. The airline said the measure is subject to government restrictions on flights within the EU being lifted and “effective public health measures” being implemented at airports. It would involve nearly 1,000 flights per day being operated and 90% of its pre-Covid-19 route network being restored. Crew and passengers will also be required to wear face masks and pass temperature checks. Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson said: It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. “After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work and restart Europe’s tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs.” Good morning readers, it’s Simon Murphy here kicking off the UK live blog today to bring you the latest developments this morning as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. With the UK’s Covid-19 death toll topping 32,000 yesterday, the UK’s easing of lockdown measures comes into effect tomorrow although the move has sowed confusion. Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of failing to give the public “clear directions” on the way through the coronavirus crisis, as the government struggled to answer a barrage of questions about its new advice to “stay alert”. Later on today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will speak in the commons where he is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme under which the Government subsidises the wages of workers temporarily laid off due to the pandemic. The Business and Transport Secretaries will also make statements. There are also briefings expected in Scotland and Wales at 1230. First up this morning, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is set to face the cameras for an interview on BBC Breakfast.', 'charCount': '87551', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false',

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Evening summary</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The government’s furlough scheme, where the state subsidises the wages off workers temporarily laid off because of the pandemic, will be extended until the end of October, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced.</strong> The four-month extension, which confirmed that the level of support will not be reduced and employers will be asked to contribute more, was welcomed by MPs from all sides as well as the unions. The announcement came shortly after Sunak told the BBC the UK recession was “already happening” what with the loss of jobs and rise in Universal Credit claims. </li> 
   <li><strong>There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, official figures indicated.</strong> This places the UK with the second-worst death toll in the world, after the US. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, include deaths where Covid-19 was named on the death certificate as a factor. </li> 
   <li><strong>The care home death rate has almost halved in the past few weeks, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said</strong>. It came as new figures were released on care home fatalities, with the ONS revealing that about 40% of Covid-19-related deaths – 2,423 – registered in the week ending 1 May in England and Wales were in care homes, the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March. The figures showed that at least 10,535 deaths to date have occurred in settings outside hospitals.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>People should use cars if they can’t walk or cycle, in order to avoid using public transport, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said.</strong> For those who have to use public transport, new <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers"">transport guidance</a> published by the government advised people to face away from each other if it isn’t possible to keep a 2 metre gap between them. Shapps also said face coverings should be worn as a precautionary measure and that passengers should avoid rush hour, re-plan visits, use contactless payments where at all possible and wash their hands before and after their journeys.</li> 
   <li><strong>Further coronavirus outbreaks and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists warned.</strong> The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser<strong> </strong>Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic.</li> 
   <li><strong>The Northern Ireland executive published its own five-step coronavirus recovery plan.</strong> The <a href=""https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf"">12-page document</a> sets out the five steps, the first of which includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining physical distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis.</li>

  <p>Property viewings and visits to estate agents may be seen as a reasonable excuse for leaving the house, under regulations coming into force in England from Wednesday which could help to reinvigorate the market.</p> 
  <p>Under previous rules put in place to help limit the spread of Covid-19, moving house where it was reasonably necessary was already deemed a valid excuse for people to be away from home.</p> 
  <p>But under amendments to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) regulations in England, a reasonable excuse will now be expanded to include undertaking several activities in connection with the purchase, sale, letting or rental of a residential property.</p> 
  <p>They include:<br>- Visiting estate or letting agents, developer sales offices or show homes;<br>- Viewing residential properties to look for a property to buy or rent;<br>- Preparing a residential property to move in;<br>- Moving home;<br>- Visiting a residential property to undertake any activities required for the rental or sale of that property.</p> 
  <p>The housing market has nearly ground to a halt in recent weeks. According to property website <strong>Zoopla</strong>, around 373,000 property transactions across the UK, with a total value of £82bn, have been put on hold due to coronavirus lockdown measures.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">'Vast majority' of employers want to do right thing to protect staff, says HSE boss</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Here are the main points from the press conference.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Downing Street has given up presenting daily figures showing how the UK’s coronavirus death toll compares with other countries’.</strong> (See <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5eba92458f080c7274539655#block-5eba92458f080c7274539655"">2.35pm</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5ebacc408f08a55ecde58a21#block-5ebacc408f08a55ecde58a21"">5.24pm</a>.) It has not given an official explanation for this yet, but the chart showed the UK ahead of the other European countries featured in terms of total deaths and, as the days progressed, the gap between the UK and its neighbours was getting ever larger. In the past, when ministers have been asked about these figures, they have pointed out that the chart showed total deaths, not deaths per head, and that the comparisons were not necessarily valid because different countries compile data in different ways. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the data at the end of the press conference slide show amounted to a daily reminder that the UK has a poor record to defend. Here are the latest figures from <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"">Worldometer</a>, a respected international website, showing the UK with the second highest death toll in the world.</li>

  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said that employers had a duty to keep their staff safe.</strong> Responding a question about what workers could do if forced to work in an environment they considered unsafe, he replied:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Employers have a duty to keep employees safe in the workplace - that is absolutely enshrined in law. If somebody feels their workplace is not safe, they have to take that up with their employer.</p> 
   <p>If they don’t feel they are getting any traction they absolutely should get in touch with the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Sarah Albon, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, said that the “vast majority” of employers wanted to do the right thing to protect their staff.</strong> She said workers have already been contacting the HSE with complaints about working conditions. But mostly, where employers were doing the wrong thing, it was because they did not know what to do, she said. She explained:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Our experience so far is that it is rather more that employers have not understood the right thing to do than that they are deliberately trying to do the wrong thing. And in the vast majority of cases, when our inspectors have got involved, employers have been only too willing to do the right thing.</p> 
   <p>We’ve been following up every time an employer has told us they’ve made changes, they’ve made an improvement to the workplace, not only with the employer ... but with the original complainant to check that they are now satisfied that their employer has done the right thing. And in the absolute vast majority of those cases, employers have made the right decision, have done the right thing, to the satisfaction of their employees. </p> 
   <p>There are a small number of cases where we are continuing to pursue that further, and we will certainly take enforcement action if that’s required.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She also stressed that the HSE can impose sanctions on employers who are not protecting staff.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things - enforcement notices, requiring them to take particular kinds of action.</p> 
   <p>In the most extreme circumstances if there is a risk of serious injury to an individual employee they can issue a notice which prohibits certain activities from taking place.</p> 
   <p>Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offence and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing.</p>

  <p><strong>Police Scotland</strong> are urging motorists to drive safely after a number of people were charged in connection with high level speeding offences over the bank holiday weekend.</p> 
  <p>The force revealed that between Friday 8 May and Sunday 10 May, 12 men were detected driving at speeds between 93mph and 111mph around one junction of the M876 near Larbert, a town near Falkirk. The men, aged between 19 and 66, will be reported to the procurator fiscal.</p> 
  <p>Other incidents across Scotland over the weekend included speeds of between 101 and 119mph on the A90 in Aberdeenshire.<br></p> 
  <p>Reiterating that the stay-at-home message is still in place for Scots, Ch Supt <strong>Louise Blakelock</strong>, head of road policing said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>With the current challenges facing us just now, we need to protect the NHS and save lives, therefore, drivers need to be more cautious and consider other road users. The high speeds detected over the weekend show that despite the clear risks involved a minority of drivers are still willing to take their chance.</p>

  <p>The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region have written to Boris Johnson to warn that the government’s change of coronavirus message comes “too early” for the north-west of England.<br><br><strong>Andy Burnham</strong> and <strong>Steve Rotheram</strong> said they were “concerned about the substance of what was announced” on Sunday. They want the government to publish the ‘R’ reproduction rate at a regional and sub-regional level to enable authorities and people to make informed decisions based on local risk.<br><br>In a letter sent on Tuesday, they write: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Here in the north-west, we experienced the highest number of new cases last week and are not yet on the clear downward trajectory seen in other parts of the country. For that reason, we are concerned that the decision to relax the ‘stay at home’ message may have come too early for the north-west and could expose our residents to higher levels of risk of infection.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The mayors also expressed their disappointment over the “lack of meaningful consultation and advance knowledge” of the changes announced on Sunday, which have an “immediate and direct impact” on policing and public transport in the north-west as in other regions.</p>

  <p><em>Q: If an unscrupulous employer tries to make people work in an environment that is not safe, will the government support them if they refuse to work?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Sharma</strong> says employers have a duty to keep employees safe. That is enshrined in law. If they feel the workplace is not safe, they must take that up. If that does not work, they should go to the HSE. He says the guidance includes contact numbers. He says the HSE will also be conducting spot checks.</p>

  <p><strong>Albon</strong> says there will be some employers who don’t do the right thing.</p> 
  <p>People have been contacting the HSE already. She says their impression is that, in the vast majority of cases, employers are at fault because they don’t know what the right thing to do is.

  <p><strong>Sarah Albon</strong>, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, says the guidance for firms makes allowance for who is in the most vulnerable category.</p> 
  <p><strong>Powis</strong> says the older people are, the more at risks they are.</p> 
  <p>But age is not the only risk factor. Obesity, underlying health and ethnicity are also factors, he says.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: At one stage experts were saying there could be between 7,000 and 20,000 deaths. Why did you get it so wrong?</em></p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">UK recession 'already happening', says Sunak</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Tomorrow the Office for National Statistics will publish its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020. Growth was flat in the final quarter of 2019 and the real impact of the coronavirus crisis is not expected until the second quarter of 2020 (April to June), when GDP could fall by 35%, if the OBR is right. </p> 
  <p>So, technically the UK is not in a recession yet (because economists only define a recession after two quarters of negative growth). But <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the chancellor, told BBC News that in practice the UK was already in one. In an interview with Laura Kuenssberg, asked if the country was facing a recession, Sunak replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We already know that many people have lost their jobs and it breaks my heart. We’ve seen what’s happening with universal credit claims already. This is not something that we’re going to wait to see; it’s already happening. There are already businesses that are shutting. There already people who have lost their jobs. And as I said, that’s heartbreaking to me and that’s why I’m working night and day to limit the amount of job losses.</p>

  <p>The international survey of how the Covid-19 crisis is impacting on mental wellbeing reveals that 57% of UK participants had suffered depression and stress.</p>

  <p>Just 55 prisoners have been released early under plans to alleviate the Covid-19 crisis in jails in England and Wales for which up to 4,000 prisoners are eligible, a minister has revealed.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lucy Frazer</strong>, the justice minister, told the justice select committee that as of 11 May, 21 pregnant women had been released from jail, five prisoners had been freed under the early release scheme and five inmates released on compassionate release.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Ministry of Justice</strong> announced on 4 April that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/04/up-to-4000-inmates-to-be-temporarily-released-in-england-and-wales"">up to 4,000 prisoners who were within two months of their release date and had passed a risk assessment would be released</a>.</p> 
  <p>Since the announcement, Public Health England (PHE) modelling has shown the spread of infection and rate of deaths in prison has been much lower than expected. But the containment of the outbreak in prisons has been driven by a highly restrictive regime, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/inmates-at-child-jail-in-kent-spending-just-40-minutes-a-day-out-of-cells"">which involves increased time in cells</a>, segregation and a ban on all visits, a regime that PHE has said would need to remain in place until April next year.</p> 
  <p>Penal reform campaigners have warned this approach is not sustainable in the long term and further releases are required.</p> 
  <p>Justice committee member, <strong>Andy Slaughter</strong> MP, said the low number of early releases represented a “missed opportunity”.</p>

  <p>Here is the official Labour response to the Treasury’s furlough scheme announcement. It’s from the shadow chancellor, <strong>Anneliese Dodds.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The furlough scheme is a lifeline for millions. The government was right not to pull it away.</p> 
   <p>It is welcome that the chancellor has heeded the call by Labour, trade unions, and businesses for more flexibility in the scheme, to support employees to go back to work part-time.</p> 
   <p>The government must clarify today when employers will be required to start making contributions, and how much they’ll be asked to pay. If every business is suddenly required to make a substantial contribution from the 1st August onwards, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rishi Sunak implied in his statement to MPs that firms would start having to make a contribution from August, but the Treasury has not given details. However, sources have been briefing journalists that, even when businesses do start having to make a contribution, the government will continue to meet more than 50% of the cost.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">DUP says furlough scheme shows how important being in UK is to Northern Ireland</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The DUP has put out a statement saying, among other things, that the furlough scheme shows the importance of Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom. This is from the DUP MP <strong>Sammy Wilson.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We have been pressing the chancellor and the prime minister about the need to avoid a cliff edge with the job retention scheme. An extension is the right decision with a direction of travel into the autumn ... </p> 
   <p>This announcement is also a reminder of how important it is for Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom. The Northern Ireland executive could not afford such a significant support scheme. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Until recently the DUP might not have felt the need to make a point like this, but since Brexit Irish reunification has become more of a salient issue than it used to be.<br></p> 
  <p>The SNP has not been making the same argument. It has welcomed the furlough announcement too, but in a statement <strong>Alison Thewliss</strong>, the SNP Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, said the UK government should maintain the scheme as long as it is needed in Scotland. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The scheme must remain in place and fully funded for as long as each of the four nations of the UK require it. People in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland must not be penalised if changes to the lockdown are made at a different pace.</p>

  <p><strong>Grant Shapps</strong> said TfL will only be able to take 15% of usual commuter levels if 100% of services are running and urged everybody to look for “alternative means of transport”.</p> 
  <p>The Tory MP and former transport minister <strong>Stephen Hammond</strong> said many Londoners who need to get to work will still need to use the tube and rail network. He asked the transport secretary:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Can I ask what discussions he’s had with the Mayor of London and with Network Rail about how quickly the London transport system can be returned to full working so that the most social distancing is possible, and also the possibility of introducing temperature scanning at London termini?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Shapps replied that ridership on TfL was up by 8% yesterday and urged people to look for alternative means of travelling. He said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I have spoken to, communicated with the Mayor and his Deputy Mayor over the weekend. I am encouraging them and working very closely with TfL to boost those services just as quickly as they can and there’s more to go there.</p> 
   <p>It is worth reiterating, even if those services ran at 100% of pre-Covid levels we would still only be able to take perhaps on the TfL 15% of existing, usual commuter levels – so it is important that everybody looks for alternative means of transport.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Shapps urges people to use cars rather than public transport</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>In his statement to the Commons, <strong>Grant Shapps</strong> said it was crucial that those who can’t do their jobs from home should travel to work by walking or cycling if possible, or even by car if necessary, in order to avoid public transport.</p> 
  <p>Shapps said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We continue to ask people to only go to work if they cannot do their jobs from home, that’s because even as transport begins to revert to a full service, the 2-metre distancing rule will only leave effective capacity for one-in-10 passengers overall. One in 10. Therefore, it’s crucial that we protect our network by minimising the pressures placed upon it and ensure it’s ready to serve those who most need it.</p> 
   <p>We are actively asking those who need to make journeys to their place of work or other essential trips to walk or to cycle wherever possible.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Shapps referred to the government’s £2bn investment related to walking and cycling, adding the first stage worth £250m would include pop-up bike lines, wider pavements and cycling and bus-only corridors.</p> 
  <p>He added: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>If people cannot walk but have access to a car - and I appreciate that I will be the only transport secretary to have said this for very many years – [if] people have access to a car we urge them to use the car before they consider public transport, avoiding where possible any busy times of day.</p>

  <p>An attempt to overturn the judiciary’s freeze preventing evictions and home repossessions during the pandemic has been rejected by the court of appeal.</p> 
  <p>Lawyers for an insolvency firm had lodged an emergency application over the alleged failure to pay mortgages on two houses in Hertfordshire which were already the subject of a legal dispute.</p> 
  <p>They challenged an emergency ‘practice direction’, made by the master of the rolls, <strong>Sir Terence Etherton</strong>, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales, which ensured that no one would lose their homes during the outbreak or be the subject of legal action that could result in them being made homeless.</p> 
  <p>In the hearing last week, Philip Rainey QC, acting for Mehmet Arkin, an insolvency practitioner, argued that the rules were ‘ultra vires’ - having not been made in accordance with the law.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Sir Geoffrey Vos</strong>, chancellor of the high court, dismissed the appeal. Giving the court’s reason on Monday, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The short delay to possession litigation enshrined in [practice direction] PD 51Z is amply justified by the exceptional circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> 
   <p>...There is a need to ensure that neither the administration of justice nor the enforcement of possession orders endanger public health by the unnecessary transmission of the virus. PD 51Z creates no risk that persons will ‘effectively be prevented from having access to justice’...</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The blanket stay has been imposed to protect public health and the administration of justice generally. The approach of a blanket stay reflects the balance struck by the Master of the Rolls, and makes clear that possession claims are not to be dealt with on a normal case by case basis during the stay.</p> 
   <p>We would strongly deprecate parties troubling the court with applications that are based only on such reasons and which are in truth bound to fail.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Survey finds 3% of hospital staff at work with coronavirus</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Screening hospital workers for Covid-19 is crucial researchers have stressed after a study in a Cambridge hospital found 3% of more than 1,000 staff without symptoms and who turned up for work had the virus. (See<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5eba8f688f08d99d46a15651#block-5eba8f688f08d99d46a15651""> 1.03pm.)</a></p> 
  <p>The study, <a>published in the journal e-Life</a>, reports how healthcare workers at Addenbrookes hospital were tested over the course of April for the disease, revealing 3% of those reporting for duty tested positive, with 17 of the 30 truly asymptomatic or showing very few, mild symptoms. Others who tested positive had symptoms more than a week before the test, during which most had self-isolated.</p> 
  <p>The team behind the study, which includes researchers at Public Health England, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, the National Institutes for Health Research and the University of Cambridge, said the work suggests up to 15,000 NHS workers across the UK could have been working while infected during April - possibly more due to PPE shortages. </p> 
  <p><strong>Prof Daniel Altmann</strong>, professor of immunology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research, said the study showed why more testing is necessary. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Most of all, it enables [the authors] to make the really key point that focus on testing symptomatic cases poses an actual risk of missing the significant spread of infection by people who have no clue they’re infected. This has such enormous implications for how we move forward in our hospitals and care homes.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Prof Charles Swanton</strong> of the Crick Institute in London, who <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/healthcare-workers-screened-covid-19-every-week-infectious-unethical"">has previously spoken out on the need for testing in hospitals</a>, agreed, noting many studies have shown the coronavirus can be transmitted by both infected individuals before symptoms occur and by asymptomatic infected individuals. The new study, he said, suggested that in each hospital there could a significant number of healthcare workers who could be transmitting the virus to both their colleagues and to patients.</p> 
  <p>“There is really a very clear mandate based on this study and several other studies over the last two, three months to initiate healthcare worker testing at scale to keep hospitals Covid protected,” he told the Guardian.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main points.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The prime minister’s spokesman refused to confirm that the government remained committed to publishing its usual daily slides, including the global deaths comparison chart. </strong>The government did publish slides yesterday, but not the usual ones including a slide showing a global deaths and another showing transport use. The spokesman said he could not say whether these slides would be used again. The government would be showing slides about the roadmap to recovery, he said. The transport use slide was moderately awkward for the government because last week it showed a small but steady increase in people travelling at a time when that was not being encouraged. Here is the one from Saturday last week.</li>

  </figure> 
  <p>But ministers were particularly embarrassed by the global deaths comparison chart. Even though it compares countries that compile their figures in different ways, and it gives total deaths not deaths per head, it looked damning because it showed the UK as having the worst death rate in Europe - and, as the days went on, this became more prominent. Here is the chart from Saturday.</p>

  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> asked employers north of the border to follow Scottish government guidelines, reiterating that measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are not applicable in Scotland. Speaking at her daily press briefing, the first minister said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis – so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge employees back prematurely.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She added that she recognised it was not an option for everyone to work from home and that if the Scottish government were to advise people to return to work then it was “absolutely incumbent” on them to ensure that they were safe in the workplace.</p> 
  <p>She welcomed Rishi Sunak’s extension of the furlough scheme to October, saying that she hoped this would avoid any cliff edge scenario for employers.</p> 
  <p>She was also questioned about BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme, which revealed on Monday evening that the public was not told about an early coronavirus outbreak at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February. (See<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5eba6d248f080c7274539498#block-5eba6d248f080c7274539498""> 9.31am.)</a></p> 
  <p>She insisted that “all appropriate steps were taken” to protect public health, including setting up an incident management team and contact tracing, but added that patient confidentiality meant small numbers of cases could not be publicly identified at that time, but that they were included in the regular NHS reporting system. But reporters pointed out that the first positive case recorded for the Edinburgh area was on 7 March, 10 days after the conference.</p>

  <p><strong>Citizens Advice</strong> has responded to the chancellor’s announcement, saying the furlough extension protects households from a financial cliff edge, but people in the shielded group need a right to access the scheme if they can’t work safely.</p> 
  <p>Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Extending the furlough scheme and allowing employers to bring back their workers part-time are sensible steps to protect household finances. The Job Retention Scheme was an unprecedented intervention which has protected jobs and put money in people’s pockets. We have made clear that changes to the scheme would be needed to make sure people don’t face a financial cliff edge.</p> 
   <p>Sadly, we continue to see cases where people in the shielded group are being denied furlough. People in this group need a right to access this scheme if they cannot work safely. Nobody should be forced to choose between paying the bills or protecting their health.</p>

  <p>The defence secretary, <strong>Ben Wallace</strong>, told the Commons during defence questions that he had offered further military help with the coronavirus crisis in care homes in a morning meeting with <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The cabinet minister told MPs that he wanted to offer care homes “the assistance they need” in “bringing testing to care homes”, or helping with the decontamination of facilities so staff don’t risk bringing the disease to and from the homes during their work.</p> 
  <p>No indication was given as to whether the prime minister had accepted the offer, but Wallace said “we stand ready” to help the Department of Health and Social Care or any other stakeholder as required, as the number of deaths and infections amongst those in care remains high.</p>

  <p>A study of staff at an NHS hospital has suggested that 3% of staff reporting as fit for duty in April were unknowingly infected with coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>Researchers at <strong>Cambridge University</strong> swabbed and tested more than 1,200 NHS workers at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge throughout April, with staff also asked about relevant coronavirus symptoms.</p> 
  <p>More than 1,000 workers reported that they were fit for duty during the study period, but 3% of them tested positive for Covid-19. <strong>Dr Mike Weekes</strong>, one of the authors of the report, said staff need to be tested regularly “regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms”.</p> 
  <p>Under closer questioning as part of the study, around one in five staff reported no symptoms, two in five had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported Covid-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously.</p> 
  <p>Weekes and his fellow senior author, <strong>Prof Stephen Baker</strong>, from the <strong>Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease</strong>, said hospitals needed to introduce screening programmes across their workforces. Weekes said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Test! Test! Test! And then test some more.</p> 
   <p>All staff need to get tested regularly for Covid-19, regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms – this will be vital to stop infection spreading within the hospital setting.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The study, published in the journal <strong>eLife</strong>, also explored possible routes of transmission of the virus through the hospital and among staff. Researchers looked at whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in “red” areas of the hospital, caring for Covid-19 patients.</p> 
  <p>Despite wearing appropriate PPE, “red” area staff were three times more likely to test positive than staff working in Covid-19-free “green” areas, the study indicated. It is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of transmission from patients to staff in red areas, as staff may have instead transmitted the virus to each other or acquired it at home.</p> 
  <p>Those working in the “red” areas were also swabbed earlier in the study, closer to when the lockdown was first initiated, so the higher rates of infection in this group might just be a symptom of higher rates of virus circulating in the community at the time.</p>

  <p>Employers have welcomed the announcement to extend the furlough scheme too. This is from Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the <strong>Institute of Directors</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>A furlough extension will bring significant relief to employers and workers across the country.</p> 
   <p>We’re delighted the Treasury has taken on the IoD’s consistent calls for a flexible furlough. Many firms will be operating far below normal capacity for the foreseeable future. A part-time furlough provides a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed. A more flexible approach will allow firms to raise activity levels in tandem with demand, helping to avoid cashflow challenges.</p>

  <p>England’s national parks have urged caution for visitors planning to return to beauty spots from Wednesday – with some still telling people to stay away.</p> 
  <p>Updated government rules on the lockdown have relaxed the “stay local” message in England so people can drive to outdoor open spaces “irrespective of distance”, as long as they respect physical distancing guidance and don’t cross borders.</p> 
  <p>However, several national parks are warning people to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid hotspots or busy areas. Visitors are also being warned that many facilities, such as car parks, visitor centres and public toilets, as well as cafes and pubs, are not yet open.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Lake District</strong> is urging people not to return yet in order to help communities in Cumbria, which officials said has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the UK. The National Park Authority chief executive, Richard Leafe, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>For now, we’re asking people not to rush back to the Lake District – help protect our communities, the fells will still be here when this passes.</p> 
  </blockquote>

  </aside> 
  <p>The <strong>Yorkshire Dales</strong> NPA’s chief executive, David Butterworth, said the government’s approach to reopening the countryside was not one it had advocated:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We, along with many organisations with countryside facilities, have advocated a staged approach with an initial ‘stay local’ message to avoid unnecessary travel and minimise any tension between visitors and local communities.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But in light of the new rules, authority-run car parks would now be opened and it was working to open toilets as soon as possible, he said, as he asked visitors to respect local communities, nature and other people.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dartmoor</strong> national park said it was reviewing how to reopen car parks and toilets and was awaiting further guidance on how to do so while safely supporting social distancing. In a statement it added:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Until then please stay at home, avoid unnecessary journeys, exercise locally and follow social distancing and hygiene rules.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And Sarah Fowler, the chief executive of the <strong>Peak District</strong> NPA, issued a personal appeal for anyone planning to travel to the area: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Before your journey, carefully consider your own wellbeing and that of the Peak District’s many small communities.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Continuing to use local parks and outdoor areas close to home could help the park ensure it can welcome visitors in the coming weeks and not put “undue pressure” on public highways, emergency access or key workers, she added.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Northern Ireland executive publishes five-step recovery plan</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The Northern Ireland executive has just published its own coronavirus recovery plan. The 12-page document is <a href=""https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf"">here (pdf)</a>, and there is a seven-page summary <a href=""https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/our-approach-to-decision-making-summary-120520.pdf"">here (pdf).</a></p> 
  <p>It envisages a five-step route to recovery.</p> 
  <p>PA Media summarises them here.</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The first step includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis.</p> 
   <p>The second step will see groups of 10 being able to meet outdoors, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups, re-opening of some libraries and open-air museums, as well as indoor activities involving limited contact of less than 10 minutes and with two to four people.</p> 
   <p>The third step will see groups of up to 30 being able to gather outside, re-opening of more libraries as well as museums and galleries, concert and theatre rehearsals resuming and larger indoor gatherings.</p> 
   <p>The fourth step is set to see socially distanced church services, resumption of competitive sport behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, leisure centres re-opening and outdoor concerts resuming on a restricted basis.</p> 
   <p>The fifth step will include the resumption of close physical contact sports, return of competitive sport, spectators at live events on a restricted basis as well as the re-opening of nightclubs and concerts on a limited basis.</p> 
   <p>However the NI executive has not included dates for when each step of the plan might be reached and warned this will take “significant time”.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And here is an extract from the plan. It says:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The executive shares the aspiration of all of you - to return to a more normal way of living our lives soon. While this will take significant time, we can guarantee that we will not retain the restrictions for any longer than is absolutely necessary,” the document reads.</p> 
   <p>However it is important that when taking decisions now, we recognise the risk of having to re-introduce restrictions if cases rise sharply again. That is why we will only decide to relax restrictions when we are sure that that is in the long-term interest of the health and wellbeing of the population.</p>

 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Tributes have been paid to an ambulance care assistant who died with coronavirus and who “dedicated his career to serving the public”.</p> 
  <p>Phil Rennie, a patient transport service care assistant for the North West ambulance service based in Oldham, contracted Covid-19 and died at Fairfield general hospital in Bury on Sunday, the service’s chief executive, Daren Mochrie, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Phil was extremely proud to work for NWAS, offering comfort and care to those in need. He has been part of the NWAS family since 2015 and has dedicated his career to serving the public, previously working in local authority and public services.</p> 
   <p>We have been supporting Phil’s family during this terrible time and they are in the thoughts of everyone here at NWAS - our deepest sympathies go out to them. Phil will be sorely missed by us all.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Parents don't have enough information to feel safe sending pupils back to school, says shadow chancellor</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Boris Johnson would like some primary school children in England to start going back to school from 1 June. Under the provisional plan published yesterday, subject to coronavirus being brought further under control, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils (the youngest and oldest at primary school) would start going back from 1 June, with all primary school pupils back for a month before the summer holidays.</p> 
  <p>But would parents comply? This morning the <strong>National Education Union</strong> has published the results of a survey of 1,000 parents which suggests that a third of them are not ready to send their children back. According to the NEU, “just under half (49%) said they would, with a third of the total sample (33%) intending to delay the return.”</p>

  <p>And one parent in that category is <strong>Anneliese Dodds</strong>, the new shadow chancellor. Dodds, who has a six-year-old and a younger child, was on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour this morning and she was asked if she would be willing to send her oldest back to school on 1 June. At first she gave an evasive answer, saying that her local school was doing “an incredible job” but that the government had not yet published evidence showing it would be safe for children to go back without posting a risk to families and children. </p> 
  <p>Towards the end of the interview the presenter, <strong>Jane Garvey</strong>, challenged her again, saying she had not answered the question. Would she send her child to school knowing what she does now? Dodds replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I would be more than happy to send my own child to school if I knew that by doing so I would not be potentially harming others. That’s the critical issue for me. And we don’t have that evidence, I feel, currently.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>So that’s a no, Garvey suggested. Dodds replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Well, I don’t feel that I have that evidence now. If government was able to provide that, particularly to publish the scientific information underlying its decisions, we could be in a different situation.</p> 
   <p>As I say, it’s not really about my family. It’s about whether we are spreading this disease more broadly. We don’t have that evidence in front of us now.</p>

  <p>Some late-morning joy. A doctor who had to miss his daughter’s first birthday due to the coronavirus pandemic said he was “blown away” by the love and kindness of his “incredible” colleagues after they surprised him with a party at the hospital to help celebrate.</p> 
  <p>Dr Rory Nolan, 29, hasn’t seen his wife, Catriona, 26, and daughter Francesca for more than two months after they made the decision to temporarily live apart so he could continue working on the frontline in A&amp;E.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">About 40% of recent Covid-related deaths in England and Wales were in care homes, ONS figures show</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Care home deaths accounted for about 40% of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending 1 May, with at least 10,535 of all deaths to date taking place outside hospitals, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.</p> 
  <p>Of the 6,035 deaths linked to Covid-19 and registered in the week ending 1 May, 2,423 (40%) were in care homes, compared with 3,214 (53%) in hospitals.</p> 
  <p>This weekly number of care home deaths is a slight dip from 2,794 in the previous seven days and is the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March, according to the ONS.</p> 
  <p>The ONS numbers are based on instances where Covid-19 is mentioned anywhere on a death certificate, including in combination with other health conditions.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Of all deaths involving coronavirus up to 1 May, 22,873 took place in hospitals, while 10,535 were elsewhere. Of these:<br>- 8,312 took place in care homes<br>- 1,562 were in private homes<br>- 386 occurred in hospices<br>- 142 took place in other communal establishments<br>- 133 happened elsewhere</p> 
  <p>The ONS figures, by date of death, suggest a peak in daily care home deaths may have taken place on 17 April, when 415 deaths occurred. During the following week, daily deaths declined consecutively for all days but one – 22 April, when deaths rose by 20. The corresponding peak for deaths in hospitals is 8 April, when 983 occurred.</p> 
  <p>In the week ending 1 May, there were 17,953 deaths registered across England and Wales – a decrease for the second week running.</p> 
  <p>However, <strong>Nick Stripe</strong>, head of health analysis at the ONS, said this is still around 8,000 deaths above the average for this time of year (see <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5eba5ed58f08a55ecde584e5#block-5eba5ed58f08a55ecde584e5"">9.50am.</a>). Speaking to BBC News, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>That is about 4,000 lower than it was the week before but it is still 8,000 above the average that we would expect to see in this week at this time of year. So it is actually the seventh highest weekly total since this data set started in 1993, so we have had four out of the top seven weeks in the last four weeks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Separate analysis shows there were 8,314 deaths in care homes involving coronavirus reported by care home providers in England to the Care Quality Commission between 10 April and 8 May, according to the ONS.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Further lockdowns inevitable without stronger plan to suppress Covid-19, scientists warn</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Further outbreaks of coronavirus and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions and send people in England back to work without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists has warned.</p> 
  <p>The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir David King</strong>, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic.</p> 
  <p>Prof King set up the “independent Sage” meetings amid concerns around the transparency of independent scientific advice reaching ministers through the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).</p> 
  <p>In a report being published today, the group warns that simply ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed is “counter-productive” and “potentially dangerous”. Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections “we shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics and face the prospect of further partial or national lockdowns”, the authors write.</p> 
  <p>The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee.</p> 
  <p>The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19, and to replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group call for a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of the outbreak control. The report states that the “over-dependence on outsourcing” is unsustainable.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Mervyn King urges Sunak not to scale back furlough scheme</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Mervyn King</strong>, the former governor of the Bank of England, said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should not scale back the coronavirus job retention scheme that allows workers to be furloughed. He said the government should continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries (as it does now, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month), instead of reducing that to 60%, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/extend-furlough-scheme-or-face-spiralling-job-losses-rishi-sunak-told"">as the Treasury has been considering.</a></p> 
  <p>Asked what Sunak should do, King said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Keep it at 80%.</p> 
   <p>I don’t think it makes sense to regard this as the major cost of the Covid-19 crisis in economic terms.</p> 
   <p>These payments under government schemes are transfers from taxpayers in general to businesses, it will lead to an increase in national debt [but] we can finance that over a long period, particularly given the very low level of long-term real interest rates.</p> 
   <p>The real cost of this shutdown is not measured by the impact on the public finances but by the lost incomes and outputs in the economy, a cost which is likely to end up as an order of magnitude [though no one can really know this] of several hundred billion pounds. That’s an enormous cost.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>King also said the “economy ought to have recovered to a very large extent” before Sunak considered ending the furlough scheme in a bid to avoid a wave of redundancies when the support is curtailed.</p>

  <p>BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme has revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh in February, well before the first confirmed cases in the country, but that this was not disclosed to the public.</p> 
  <p>Scotland’s first confirmed coronavirus case, in Tayside, was announced on 1 March, but Disclosure, broadcast on Monday night, revealed an outbreak that began the week before, on 26 and 27 February, at a conference of international delegates for the sportswear company Nike. At least 25 people linked to this event have since been confirmed to have been infected, said the programme, eight of them resident in Scotland.<br></p> 
  <p>Nike told the BBC it instigated enhanced measures, including contact tracing and increased cleaning and disinfection processes in their stores and offices, and that all its staff had now recovered. The Scottish government confirmed health authorities were alerted to the potential outbreak on 2 March.</p>

  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>New guidance issued by the Department for Transport on how to travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak states that passengers should minimise the time they spend near other people and avoid physical contact with them.</p> 
   <p>It acknowledges that “there may be situations where you can’t keep a suitable distance from people”, such as on busier services or at peak times.</p> 
   <p>The document states: “In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.”</p> 
   <p>It goes on: “The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.”</p>

   <p>This may include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Excess deaths in England and Wales down to 8,000 by final week of April, says ONS</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The Office for National Statistics has just published<a href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending1may2020""> its latest weekly death figures for England and Wales.</a></p> 
  <p>They go up to the week ending Friday 1 May (or week 18, as the ONS calls it).</p> 
  <p>The ONS figures lag behind the daily figures published by the government, because they are based on registered deaths. But they are more comprehensive. The daily government figures just count people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. The ONS figures for coronavirus deaths include all those where it was mentioned on the death certificate, which often happens if a patient had symptoms but did not test positive.</p> 
  <p>The figures show that by the end of April coronavirus deaths were falling, but total excess deaths (ie, the number of weekly deaths above what you would expect in an average week) was still very high.</p> 
  <p>Here are the main points.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Excess deaths in England and Wales were running at around 8,000 at the end of April</strong>. There were 8,012 more deaths in week 18 than the five-year average for that time of year. Overall there were 17,953 deaths that week. In the previous week <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-live-contact-tracing-app-trial-begins-on-isle-of-wight?page=with:block-5eb1244d8f0823bcf60b59a3#block-5eb1244d8f0823bcf60b59a3"">there were 11,539 excess deaths.</a></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>For the second week in a row overall deaths were down.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Coronavirus deaths in week 18 accounted for 33.6% of all deaths, down from 37.4% in the previous weeks.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Deaths in care homes were also down in week 18.</strong> There were 6,409. But 37.8% of those deaths involved coronavirus, up from 35.3% the previous week.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>All regions showed a decrease in the proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in week 18.</strong></li>

  <p>A railway ticket office worker has died of Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty, as a union calls for a government compensation scheme for bereaved families of frontline employees to be extended to cover transport staff.</p> 
  <p><strong>Belly Mujinga</strong>, 47, was on the concourse of Victoria station in London in March when a man who said he had Covid-19 spat and coughed at her and a colleague. Within days of the assault, both women fell ill with coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>Mujinga, who had underlying respiratory problems, was admitted to Barnet Hospital and put on a ventilator but died on 5 April, her trade union, the<strong> Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA)</strong>, said. Just 10 people were allowed to attend her funeral.</p> 
  <p>The union has reported the incident to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail (ORR), for investigation and is taking legal advice on the situation.</p> 
  <p>TSSA says there are questions to answer as to why Mujinga was not stood down from duty earlier given her underlying health condition.</p>

Our view is that this compensation should be extended to the families of all frontline workers who perish trying to keep our country and vital services going.</p> 
   <p>Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them. However, there are serious questions about her death; it wasn’t inevitable.</p> 
   <p>As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category, and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why she wasn’t stood down from frontline duties early on in this pandemic.</p>

  <p>“It’s her employer, the company and the state who have to look at that. Me and Ingrid [his 11-year-old daughter] we saw Belly, on 2 April when she left for hospital. Then we didn’t see her again.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Care home death rate has nearly halved in last few weeks, Hancock says</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The number of people dying in care homes has nearly halved in the past few weeks, according to <strong>Matt Hancock</strong> as he rejected the accusations that the adult and social care sector is being let down by the government.</p> 
  <p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>I’m really pleased that the number of people dying in care homes is now falling, quite sharply. The number has almost halved over the past two to three weeks, since the peak.</p> 
   <p>It’s very clear to me that the transmission in care homes is coming down and is much lower than it was.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It comes as new figures are set to be released on care home fatalities, with<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/hopes-raised-for-end-to-covid-19-crisis-in-uk-care-homes-as-death-rates-fall""> the Office for National Statistics previously revealing</a> that there were 5,890 coronavirus-related care home deaths registered up to 24 April in England and Wales.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, yesterday<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals""> figures were released</a> showing that women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles.</p> 
  <p>Defending the government’s role in handling the crisis in care homes, Hancock added: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Some of our most vulnerable people live in care homes and yet only around a quarter of the deaths that have happened have been in care homes. That’s much lower than most international comparators.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Hancock defends move to allow people to meet one parent but not both at the same time</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p><strong>Matt Hancock</strong> has defended new rules that allow people to meet one parent but not both at the same time, as he rejected claims the new lockdown measures had sowed confusion.</p> 
  <p>For the first time since the lockdown was imposed in March, from tomorrow people will be able to meet a single member from another household in a public place so long as they maintain physical distancing. However, the new rules prevent a person from meeting both parents at the same time.</p>

  <p>Asked what was wrong with someone seeing both their parents so long as they were 2 metres apart, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: <br></p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>These things are a judgment and what we don’t want is large groups of people gathering and you have to make a judgment as to what is reasonable and where to set the rules.</p> 
   <p>And it’s perfectly reasonable to have a rule that only one individual can meet up with one other at that 2 metre distance, and outside is safer than inside because the science is clear that outside, although the risks are not zero, there is a lower risk to people being approximate outside.</p> 
   <p>Therefore, a rule that you can only meet up with one other person just protects everybody against that burgeoning into large groups of people.</p>

  <p>The health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, says the reproduction rate of Covid-19 in the UK is “broadly in the middle of the range” of 0.5 to 0.9, insisting it is definitely below one.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in an earlier interview on Sky News, Hancock said cleaners entering people’s homes should exercise social distancing rules and follow other good practices, such as washing their hands regularly. </p> 
  <p>Challenged on why grandparents could not see their grandchildren but children could see their carers, Hancock said it was a “scientific fact” that older people were more vulnerable to Covid-19. He added: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>The principles are really clear and the public has been sensible so far. The Great British public have really understood what social distancing means, why we need to do it … the principles are: outside is better than inside, stay 2 metres away, wash your hands and clean the surfaces, and see as few people as you can outside of your household because that virus spreads but we do also at the same time need to get people back to work.”</p>

  <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>We can’t afford not to do it correctly. I think it is really important the chancellor continues with the good practice of making sure that furlough scheme is in place and doesn’t try and reduce it too soon, because that will cost us in the longer term.</p> 
   <p>Many families wouldn’t be able to survive right now if it wasn’t for things like the furlough scheme. It is absolutely right the government has stepped in but they can’t now pull the rug from underneath people’s feet - they have to continue to support people throughout this crisis.</p> 
   <p>We will have to look at how the economy recovers, but it is not going to recover quickly enough if we pull the rug from people now and people end up destitute and we end up having that R rate spiking again and back in lockdown.</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Hancock dodges questions about people's legal right to refuse return to work</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>Matt Hancock has dodged questions on whether people have a legal right not to work if they do not feel safe due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> 
  <p>There are major concerns that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-return-to-work-employment-law-logistical-nightmare"">workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk</a>, and industry figures have said the mental health impacts of returning to a new “alien environment” are not being prioritised.</p> 
  <p>Asked on BBC Breakfast whether or not someone has a legal right not to go to work if they do not feel their workplace is safe, Hancock declined to give a direct answer twice. Asked the first time, he replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>Well this needs to be a collaborative effort. Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important … Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home because obviously that’s the safest way to work.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Pressed again on whether they would have a legal right not to work if they felt unsafe, he said: “Well, employment law has not changed but that isn’t the point. The point is that businesses and their employees should be working together … to make the best of what is a very difficult situation.”</p>

 <h2 class=""block-title"">Meeting a friend in your garden is not safer than doing so in a park, says Matt Hancock</h2> 
 <div class=""block-elements""> 
  <p>The health secretary,<strong> Matt Hancock</strong>, has rejected the idea that meeting a friend in someone’s garden is safer than doing so in a park, as he sought to defend the new lockdown easing measures set to come into force tomorrow.<br></p> 
  <p>From Wednesday, people will be able to meet one member from a different household in a public place at two metres distance for the first time since the lockdown was imposed.</p>

  </figure> 
  <p>But the minister rejected a viewer’s suggestion that it was safer to meet a friend in their garden rather than a busy park. The viewer’s question, which was read out to Hancock on BBC Breakfast said: “Can I have a friend round in my garden if we stay two metres apart, surely it’s more safe than meeting them in a park with more people?”</p> 
  <p>But Hancock fired back: “It’s not necessarily more safe than meeting in a park and we’ve said that that should only happen in public places…”</p> 
  <p>Asked why it is not as safe, Hancock continued: </p> 
  <blockquote class=""quoted""> 
   <p>For instance, lots of people can only get to their garden by going through their house, being with people indoors is not as safe as outdoors and so that’s why we’ve come to this judgment. And it is a balanced judgment that that is best done in a park or in a public place.</p> 
   <p>We brought that in so that people can see others from outside their household but also without encouraging large groups to gather and encouraging things that the scientists tell us would increase the risk of the spread of the virus.</p>

  <p>It would involve nearly 1,000 flights per day being operated and 90% of its pre-Covid-19 route network being restored. Crew and passengers will also be required to wear face masks and pass temperature checks. Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson said: </p>

   <p>It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>

Follow our global coverage here The government’s furlough scheme, where the state subsidises the wages off workers temporarily laid off because of the pandemic, will be extended until the end of October, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced. The four-month extension, which confirmed that the level of support will not be reduced and employers will be asked to contribute more, was welcomed by MPs from all sides as well as the unions. The announcement came shortly after Sunak told the BBC the UK recession was “already happening” what with the loss of jobs and rise in Universal Credit claims. There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, official figures indicated. This places the UK with the second-worst death toll in the world, after the US. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, include deaths where Covid-19 was named on the death certificate as a factor. The care home death rate has almost halved in the past few weeks, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said. It came as new figures were released on care home fatalities, with the ONS revealing that about 40% of Covid-19-related deaths – 2,423 – registered in the week ending 1 May in England and Wales were in care homes, the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March. The figures showed that at least 10,535 deaths to date have occurred in settings outside hospitals. People should use cars if they can’t walk or cycle, in order to avoid using public transport, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said. For those who have to use public transport, new transport guidance published by the government advised people to face away from each other if it isn’t possible to keep a 2 metre gap between them. Shapps also said face coverings should be worn as a precautionary measure and that passengers should avoid rush hour, re-plan visits, use contactless payments where at all possible and wash their hands before and after their journeys. Further coronavirus outbreaks and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists warned. The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic. The Northern Ireland executive published its own five-step coronavirus recovery plan. The 12-page document sets out the five steps, the first of which includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining physical distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis. That’s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian’s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Property viewings and visits to estate agents may be seen as a reasonable excuse for leaving the house, under regulations coming into force in England from Wednesday which could help to reinvigorate the market. Under previous rules put in place to help limit the spread of Covid-19, moving house where it was reasonably necessary was already deemed a valid excuse for people to be away from home. But under amendments to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) regulations in England, a reasonable excuse will now be expanded to include undertaking several activities in connection with the purchase, sale, letting or rental of a residential property. They include: - Visiting estate or letting agents, developer sales offices or show homes; - Viewing residential properties to look for a property to buy or rent; - Preparing a residential property to move in; - Moving home; - Visiting a residential property to undertake any activities required for the rental or sale of that property. The housing market has nearly ground to a halt in recent weeks. According to property website Zoopla, around 373,000 property transactions across the UK, with a total value of £82bn, have been put on hold due to coronavirus lockdown measures. Here are the main points from the press conference. Downing Street has given up presenting daily figures showing how the UK’s coronavirus death toll compares with other countries’. (See 2.35pm and 5.24pm.) It has not given an official explanation for this yet, but the chart showed the UK ahead of the other European countries featured in terms of total deaths and, as the days progressed, the gap between the UK and its neighbours was getting ever larger. In the past, when ministers have been asked about these figures, they have pointed out that the chart showed total deaths, not deaths per head, and that the comparisons were not necessarily valid because different countries compile data in different ways. Nevertheless, the inclusion of the data at the end of the press conference slide show amounted to a daily reminder that the UK has a poor record to defend. Here are the latest figures from Worldometer, a respected international website, showing the UK with the second highest death toll in the world. And here is an alternative chart from the FT’s John Burn-Murdoch, who has been producing his own global death comparison charts. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said that employers had a duty to keep their staff safe. Responding a question about what workers could do if forced to work in an environment they considered unsafe, he replied: Employers have a duty to keep employees safe in the workplace - that is absolutely enshrined in law. If somebody feels their workplace is not safe, they have to take that up with their employer. If they don’t feel they are getting any traction they absolutely should get in touch with the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority. Sarah Albon, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, said that the “vast majority” of employers wanted to do the right thing to protect their staff. She said workers have already been contacting the HSE with complaints about working conditions. But mostly, where employers were doing the wrong thing, it was because they did not know what to do, she said. She explained: Our experience so far is that it is rather more that employers have not understood the right thing to do than that they are deliberately trying to do the wrong thing. And in the vast majority of cases, when our inspectors have got involved, employers have been only too willing to do the right thing. We’ve been following up every time an employer has told us they’ve made changes, they’ve made an improvement to the workplace, not only with the employer ... but with the original complainant to check that they are now satisfied that their employer has done the right thing. And in the absolute vast majority of those cases, employers have made the right decision, have done the right thing, to the satisfaction of their employees. There are a small number of cases where we are continuing to pursue that further, and we will certainly take enforcement action if that’s required. She also stressed that the HSE can impose sanctions on employers who are not protecting staff. Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things - enforcement notices, requiring them to take particular kinds of action. In the most extreme circumstances if there is a risk of serious injury to an individual employee they can issue a notice which prohibits certain activities from taking place. Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offence and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing. The England and Wales Cricket Board is expected to deliver guidelines on reopening some parts of club and recreational cricket, possibly as early as Wednesday. Cricket was one of the outdoor summer sports overlooked in the government’s new lockdown guidelines, whereas golf, tennis, and angling – more obviously isolated pursuits – were specifically mentioned by the prime minister. Full story here: Police Scotland are urging motorists to drive safely after a number of people were charged in connection with high level speeding offences over the bank holiday weekend. The force revealed that between Friday 8 May and Sunday 10 May, 12 men were detected driving at speeds between 93mph and 111mph around one junction of the M876 near Larbert, a town near Falkirk. The men, aged between 19 and 66, will be reported to the procurator fiscal. Other incidents across Scotland over the weekend included speeds of between 101 and 119mph on the A90 in Aberdeenshire. Reiterating that the stay-at-home message is still in place for Scots, Ch Supt Louise Blakelock, head of road policing said: With the current challenges facing us just now, we need to protect the NHS and save lives, therefore, drivers need to be more cautious and consider other road users. The high speeds detected over the weekend show that despite the clear risks involved a minority of drivers are still willing to take their chance. The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region have written to Boris Johnson to warn that the government’s change of coronavirus message comes “too early” for the north-west of England. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram said they were “concerned about the substance of what was announced” on Sunday. They want the government to publish the ‘R’ reproduction rate at a regional and sub-regional level to enable authorities and people to make informed decisions based on local risk. In a letter sent on Tuesday, they write: Here in the north-west, we experienced the highest number of new cases last week and are not yet on the clear downward trajectory seen in other parts of the country. For that reason, we are concerned that the decision to relax the ‘stay at home’ message may have come too early for the north-west and could expose our residents to higher levels of risk of infection. The mayors also expressed their disappointment over the “lack of meaningful consultation and advance knowledge” of the changes announced on Sunday, which have an “immediate and direct impact” on policing and public transport in the north-west as in other regions. Q: People in places like Lincolnshire are worried about tourists arriving under this week’s new guidelines. What assurances can you give them? And when will tourism resume? Sharma says the new guidelines do not allow people to go and visit places and stay the night. On tourism, he says the government has put in place various measures to help businesses in this sector already. But he says it is vital to avoid a second peak. A second peak would be the worst possible thing for businesses, he says. And that’s it. The press conference is over. Q: You need union cooperation. So will you drop the pledge in your manifesto to curb their powers? Sharma says he has been collaborating with the unions. The government will continue that approach, he says. Q: So do the manifesto pledges remain in place? Sharma says he is focusing on working with the unions to address the coronavirus crisis. Q: What penalties can the HSE impose? Albon says it can use enforcement notices requiring certain activities. It can also prohibit certain actions. If an employer breaches that, that is an offence. Powis says NHS staff are trying to implement the guidelines saying relatives should be able to be with someone dying. He says it will get easier as hospitals become less over-loaded. Q: If an unscrupulous employer tries to make people work in an environment that is not safe, will the government support them if they refuse to work? Sharma says employers have a duty to keep employees safe. That is enshrined in law. If they feel the workplace is not safe, they must take that up. If that does not work, they should go to the HSE. He says the guidance includes contact numbers. He says the HSE will also be conducting spot checks. But he says his impression is that most employers want to do the right thing. Albon says there will be some employers who don’t do the right thing. People have been contacting the HSE already. She says their impression is that, in the vast majority of cases, employers are at fault because they don’t know what the right thing to do is. When told, they mostly comply. In the small number of cases where they don’t, the HSE will take enforcement action, she says. Q: Why does your advice treat people under 70 the same, when people in their 20s are at much less risk than people in their 50s? Sharma says every death is a tragedy. That is why the government advice tries to protect people. Sarah Albon, chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, says the guidance for firms makes allowance for who is in the most vulnerable category. Powis says the older people are, the more at risks they are. But age is not the only risk factor. Obesity, underlying health and ethnicity are also factors, he says. Q: At one stage experts were saying there could be between 7,000 and 20,000 deaths. Why did you get it so wrong? Powis says the original reasonable worst case scenario envisaged 500,000 deaths. He says the UK is doing much better than that. Q: What can you do to help care homes stay open? Sharma says the government is providing support to businesses. He acknowledges this is a difficult time. He says the cumulative value of “bounce back” loans is £8bn, and the business interruption loans scheme has paid out £6bn. Q: But care homes don’t need to furlough staff. And their business is not interrupted. Yet they still need help. Sharma says the business support offered is among the best in the world. Here is the hospital data slide. And here is the final slide. The global deaths comparison chart has been abandoned. Downing Street suggested this might happen at the briefing early. The figures were a huge embarrassment to No 10, so perhaps it is not surprising that they have been erased from the daily record. (See 2.35pm.) Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, is now presenting the rest of the slides. He says there are in an “updated format” compared to how they used to be presented. Here is the transport use one. Here is the slide for deaths of those who tested positive for coronavirus And this slide shows deaths where coronavirus was suspected, as well as where it was confirmed. He says this shows the death rate falling, including in care homes. Sharma says the government wants workers to feel safe as they go back to work. Sharma says he thinks he has reached a consensus with unions and business on the guidelines for safe working. (See 10.30am.) The messaging has changed too, Sharma says, as he introduces slide three. The next slide shows the three steps for the way ahead. Sharma is now reminding people of the strategy. He introduces the first slide. It shows the alert levels. Sharma is now reading out the latest testing and death figures. The figures are here. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is here for the daily press conference. Tomorrow the Office for National Statistics will publish its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020. Growth was flat in the final quarter of 2019 and the real impact of the coronavirus crisis is not expected until the second quarter of 2020 (April to June), when GDP could fall by 35%, if the OBR is right. So, technically the UK is not in a recession yet (because economists only define a recession after two quarters of negative growth). But Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, told BBC News that in practice the UK was already in one. In an interview with Laura Kuenssberg, asked if the country was facing a recession, Sunak replied: We already know that many people have lost their jobs and it breaks my heart. We’ve seen what’s happening with universal credit claims already. This is not something that we’re going to wait to see; it’s already happening. There are already businesses that are shutting. There already people who have lost their jobs. And as I said, that’s heartbreaking to me and that’s why I’m working night and day to limit the amount of job losses. Reading and Leeds music festivals have been cancelled due to the pandemic. A statement from the organisers said: We’ve been closely monitoring this unprecedented situation and we were hopeful we could deliver the ultimate festival to you in August, something to look forward to in these strange and confusing times. However, it has become clear that it’s just not possible for this year’s festival to go ahead. We want to extend our gratitude to our teams, artists and partners who work so hard each year. And to our fans, we’re nothing without you - we thank you for your continued support and understanding. More than half of Britons feel down, depressed and hopeless over the future, a pan-European study of mental health during the pandemic has found. The international survey of how the Covid-19 crisis is impacting on mental wellbeing reveals that 57% of UK participants had suffered depression and stress. Overall the three-country investigation concluded that the mental health of 41% of the UK population is at risk as a result of the coronavirus. The study collected data on people in the UK, Spain and Italy between 24 April and 17 May. Just 55 prisoners have been released early under plans to alleviate the Covid-19 crisis in jails in England and Wales for which up to 4,000 prisoners are eligible, a minister has revealed. Lucy Frazer, the justice minister, told the justice select committee that as of 11 May, 21 pregnant women had been released from jail, five prisoners had been freed under the early release scheme and five inmates released on compassionate release. The Ministry of Justice announced on 4 April that up to 4,000 prisoners who were within two months of their release date and had passed a risk assessment would be released. Since the announcement, Public Health England (PHE) modelling has shown the spread of infection and rate of deaths in prison has been much lower than expected. But the containment of the outbreak in prisons has been driven by a highly restrictive regime, which involves increased time in cells, segregation and a ban on all visits, a regime that PHE has said would need to remain in place until April next year. Penal reform campaigners have warned this approach is not sustainable in the long term and further releases are required. Justice committee member, Andy Slaughter MP, said the low number of early releases represented a “missed opportunity”. Here is the official Labour response to the Treasury’s furlough scheme announcement. It’s from the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. The furlough scheme is a lifeline for millions. The government was right not to pull it away. It is welcome that the chancellor has heeded the call by Labour, trade unions, and businesses for more flexibility in the scheme, to support employees to go back to work part-time. The government must clarify today when employers will be required to start making contributions, and how much they’ll be asked to pay. If every business is suddenly required to make a substantial contribution from the 1st August onwards, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies. Rishi Sunak implied in his statement to MPs that firms would start having to make a contribution from August, but the Treasury has not given details. However, sources have been briefing journalists that, even when businesses do start having to make a contribution, the government will continue to meet more than 50% of the cost. These are from the Press Association’s Ian Jones. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, has been looking at the government guidance for physical distancing in schools (see 10.30am) and she is not impressed. In a statement she said: This guidance raises more questions than it answers leaving headteachers and school leaders unable to adequately plan for the reopening of their schools on this basis. There is still no realistic guidance for how social distancing will be kept in place with the age groups that will return first, how staff and families of children will be protected, or how class sizes of 15 will be achieved with the resources schools have. The government must urgently convene education unions and the profession to create a workable plan for the reopening of schools when the science indicates it is safe to do so and which has the confidence of all those affected. The DUP has put out a statement saying, among other things, that the furlough scheme shows the importance of Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom. This is from the DUP MP Sammy Wilson. We have been pressing the chancellor and the prime minister about the need to avoid a cliff edge with the job retention scheme. An extension is the right decision with a direction of travel into the autumn ... This announcement is also a reminder of how important it is for Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom. The Northern Ireland executive could not afford such a significant support scheme. Until recently the DUP might not have felt the need to make a point like this, but since Brexit Irish reunification has become more of a salient issue than it used to be. The SNP has not been making the same argument. It has welcomed the furlough announcement too, but in a statement Alison Thewliss, the SNP Treasury spokesperson at Westminster, said the UK government should maintain the scheme as long as it is needed in Scotland. She said: The scheme must remain in place and fully funded for as long as each of the four nations of the UK require it. People in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland must not be penalised if changes to the lockdown are made at a different pace. Grant Shapps said TfL will only be able to take 15% of usual commuter levels if 100% of services are running and urged everybody to look for “alternative means of transport”. The Tory MP and former transport minister Stephen Hammond said many Londoners who need to get to work will still need to use the tube and rail network. He asked the transport secretary: Can I ask what discussions he’s had with the Mayor of London and with Network Rail about how quickly the London transport system can be returned to full working so that the most social distancing is possible, and also the possibility of introducing temperature scanning at London termini? Shapps replied that ridership on TfL was up by 8% yesterday and urged people to look for alternative means of travelling. He said: I have spoken to, communicated with the Mayor and his Deputy Mayor over the weekend. I am encouraging them and working very closely with TfL to boost those services just as quickly as they can and there’s more to go there. It is worth reiterating, even if those services ran at 100% of pre-Covid levels we would still only be able to take perhaps on the TfL 15% of existing, usual commuter levels – so it is important that everybody looks for alternative means of transport. A further 627 people have died in the UK across all settings, up from 32,065 yesterday, the DHSC said. This is significantly lower than the figures released earlier today by the ONS, which suggested the official death toll has surpassed 40,000. Unlike the government’s daily stats, the ONS figures include all instances where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including cases without a positive test and suspected cases. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the eventual cost of the Treasury’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which pays firms to furlough workers, could be close to £100bn. The Treasury has refused to say what it expects the final cost to be, although insiders have dismissed claims that it will cost £13bn a month as an over-estimate. Another 16 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the death toll there to 1,132, Public Health Wales said. A further 105 positive cases were also reported, bringing that total to 11,573. Northern Rail is to use the collapse in demand for rail travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic to finally retire its entire fleet of Pacer trains. These much-maligned “buses on rails” have become a leaking, squeaking symbol of the underinvestment in northern England in recent years as Northern Rail missed successive deadlines to send them to the railway knacker’s yard. But at a virtual meeting of the Rail North Committee on Tuesday, politicians including Greater Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham were told that no pacers will be on the Northern network from this Saturday (18 May). Not all will go to train heaven, however: a few will be kept for “contingency”. One has already been sent to the National Railway Museum in York and three others were “won” by charities and community groups, which will see the rusty old carriages turned into a men’s cooking school, a science lab for a Bradford primary and a non-clinical space for patients at Airedale general hospital. This weekend the operator (run by the state since March after a disastrous few years in the private sector) looks to increase services from 45% to 63% of normal services. The meeting heard that physical distancing is currently possible on services run by Northern and Transpennine Express as passenger numbers remained at 5% of their normal levels. This is from Water UK, the trade body representing the major water companies in the UK. The prime minister told MPs on Monday it might be possible to track local “flare ups” of coronavirus by testing “the water supply”, which confused and scared many. No 10 quickly issued a clarification that he was referring to sewage or waste water, not the fresh water that comes out of our taps. A total of 42 Transport for London workers have died with Covid-19, the transport secretary said. On Network Rail, including the train operating companies, the number is 10, Shapps told the Commons. He added that it isn’t currently known if this was “through their jobs”. As a precautionary measure, people should wear face coverings on public transport, Shapps said, urging people to think about the needs of others. He told the Commons: [Wearing face coverings on public transport] could help protect other travellers from coronavirus, where someone has perhaps unwittingly or unknowingly developed the illness but they’re not actually showing any symptoms. We urge passengers to avoid the rush hour, re-plan their visits, to use contactless payments where at all possible and to wash their hands before and after their journeys. In his statement to the Commons, Grant Shapps said it was crucial that those who can’t do their jobs from home should travel to work by walking or cycling if possible, or even by car if necessary, in order to avoid public transport. Shapps said: We continue to ask people to only go to work if they cannot do their jobs from home, that’s because even as transport begins to revert to a full service, the 2-metre distancing rule will only leave effective capacity for one-in-10 passengers overall. One in 10. Therefore, it’s crucial that we protect our network by minimising the pressures placed upon it and ensure it’s ready to serve those who most need it. We are actively asking those who need to make journeys to their place of work or other essential trips to walk or to cycle wherever possible. Shapps referred to the government’s £2bn investment related to walking and cycling, adding the first stage worth £250m would include pop-up bike lines, wider pavements and cycling and bus-only corridors. He added: If people cannot walk but have access to a car - and I appreciate that I will be the only transport secretary to have said this for very many years – [if] people have access to a car we urge them to use the car before they consider public transport, avoiding where possible any busy times of day. An attempt to overturn the judiciary’s freeze preventing evictions and home repossessions during the pandemic has been rejected by the court of appeal. Lawyers for an insolvency firm had lodged an emergency application over the alleged failure to pay mortgages on two houses in Hertfordshire which were already the subject of a legal dispute. They challenged an emergency ‘practice direction’, made by the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales, which ensured that no one would lose their homes during the outbreak or be the subject of legal action that could result in them being made homeless. In the hearing last week, Philip Rainey QC, acting for Mehmet Arkin, an insolvency practitioner, argued that the rules were ‘ultra vires’ - having not been made in accordance with the law. But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, dismissed the appeal. Giving the court’s reason on Monday, he said: The short delay to possession litigation enshrined in [practice direction] PD 51Z is amply justified by the exceptional circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. ...There is a need to ensure that neither the administration of justice nor the enforcement of possession orders endanger public health by the unnecessary transmission of the virus. PD 51Z creates no risk that persons will ‘effectively be prevented from having access to justice’... He added: The blanket stay has been imposed to protect public health and the administration of justice generally. The approach of a blanket stay reflects the balance struck by the Master of the Rolls, and makes clear that possession claims are not to be dealt with on a normal case by case basis during the stay. We would strongly deprecate parties troubling the court with applications that are based only on such reasons and which are in truth bound to fail. Transport is undoubtedly going to “play a very central role” in the UK’s “gradual” recovery from the pandemic, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has told MPs. Making a statement in the Commons on Covid-19 guidance for transport users and operators, he said: It will be the key to restarting our economy ... our nation’s emergence from this crisis will not be a single leap to freedom, it will be a gradual process. Outlining the two new pieces of guidance, he added: We remain clear that those who can work from home should continue to do so. However, as those who cannot start to return to their jobs, the safety of the public and of the transport workers must be paramount. There have been a further nine deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said, bringing the total related fatalities there to 447. In a Commons statement earlier this afternoon, the business secretary Alok Sharma said he believed “consensus” had been reached in developing guidance on how firms should safely reopen. He told MPs: As we return to work, the government wants to give employers and workers confidence that their workplaces will be safe for them to return to because we recognise this is an anxious time for many. This includes ensuring people work from home if they can, but he added: For those who cannot work from home and whose workplace has not been told to close, our message is clear - you should go to work. Staff should speak to their employer about when the workplace will open. On the use of face masks, Sharma said it is an “option” for workers but is “not required by law in the workplace”. The owners of Hampstead Heath have ruled out reopening bathing ponds in the park despite Boris Johnson’s pledge to allow outdoor swimming. But a return to bathing in Hyde Park’s Serpentine lake is being considered. The Corporation of London, which runs the north London park, said it could not reopen its three swimming ponds or its Lido and maintain physical distancing rules. The Royal Parks, which runs Hyde Park, said it is reviewing whether it can reopen the park’s Serpentine lake for swimming in a way that is safe and allows for physical distancing. The prime minister was challenged in the Commons on Monday to say more about swimming by the Tory MP Desmond Swayne, a well-known wild swimmer who regularly bathes in the Serpentine. Johnson said: We’ve all lived so far with onerous restrictions on outdoor spaces and exercise. Unfortunately we can’t do anything for swimming pools, but we can do something for lakes and the sea. This is where we can go significantly, further, because there is a lower risk outdoors than indoors. But there is no mention of swimming in the government’s road map on easing the lockdown. And it said ticketed outdoor venues will remain closed. It says: “ You will still not be able to use areas like playgrounds, outdoor gyms or ticketed outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. Screening hospital workers for Covid-19 is crucial researchers have stressed after a study in a Cambridge hospital found 3% of more than 1,000 staff without symptoms and who turned up for work had the virus. (See 1.03pm.) The study, published in the journal e-Life, reports how healthcare workers at Addenbrookes hospital were tested over the course of April for the disease, revealing 3% of those reporting for duty tested positive, with 17 of the 30 truly asymptomatic or showing very few, mild symptoms. Others who tested positive had symptoms more than a week before the test, during which most had self-isolated. The team behind the study, which includes researchers at Public Health England, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, the National Institutes for Health Research and the University of Cambridge, said the work suggests up to 15,000 NHS workers across the UK could have been working while infected during April - possibly more due to PPE shortages. Prof Daniel Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research, said the study showed why more testing is necessary. He said: Most of all, it enables [the authors] to make the really key point that focus on testing symptomatic cases poses an actual risk of missing the significant spread of infection by people who have no clue they’re infected. This has such enormous implications for how we move forward in our hospitals and care homes. Prof Charles Swanton of the Crick Institute in London, who has previously spoken out on the need for testing in hospitals, agreed, noting many studies have shown the coronavirus can be transmitted by both infected individuals before symptoms occur and by asymptomatic infected individuals. The new study, he said, suggested that in each hospital there could a significant number of healthcare workers who could be transmitting the virus to both their colleagues and to patients. “There is really a very clear mandate based on this study and several other studies over the last two, three months to initiate healthcare worker testing at scale to keep hospitals Covid protected,” he told the Guardian. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister’s spokesman refused to confirm that the government remained committed to publishing its usual daily slides, including the global deaths comparison chart. The government did publish slides yesterday, but not the usual ones including a slide showing a global deaths and another showing transport use. The spokesman said he could not say whether these slides would be used again. The government would be showing slides about the roadmap to recovery, he said. The transport use slide was moderately awkward for the government because last week it showed a small but steady increase in people travelling at a time when that was not being encouraged. Here is the one from Saturday last week. But ministers were particularly embarrassed by the global deaths comparison chart. Even though it compares countries that compile their figures in different ways, and it gives total deaths not deaths per head, it looked damning because it showed the UK as having the worst death rate in Europe - and, as the days went on, this became more prominent. Here is the chart from Saturday. The spokesman backed what Matt Hancock said this morning about how foreign holidays this summer might not be possible. He said that the current advice was against travelling abroad apart from for essential reasons. Those reasons did not include holidays, he said. The spokesman confirmed that the government was committed to having 18,000 contact tracers in place by the week commencing 18 May. Expanding on what the PM said about this target in the Commons yesterday, the spokesman said: We have had 15,000 people expressing interest. That’s 15,000 health care professionals expressing interest in supporting the training programme. We are starting to get them trained. We are confident that we will have 18,000 staff available from the week commencing May 18. That’s a mix of call handlers and health staff. So, 15,000 of those are call handlers and around 3,000 health staff. The spokesman said that work was ongoing to look at how sewage could be used to map the spread of coronavirus through the country. Asked to elaborate on what Boris Johnson said about this yesterday, the spokesman said that water companies are working with universities in mapping the spread of coronavirus by examining sewage. He said Water UK had issued a statement on this, saying that non-infectious traces of coronavirus can remain in sewage. NHS England has announced 350 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 23,709. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 350 new deaths announced today, 44 occurred on 11 May, 90 occurred on 10 May and 44 occurred on 9 May. It was Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and arguably the most powerful figure on the Labour left. (See 2.04pm.) He does not normally put out press releases complimenting Conservative governments, but he represents workers, and he has warmly welcomed the extension of the furlough scheme. Here is his statement in full. The chancellor’s announcement will be a welcome relief to households across the country. The job retention scheme is as crucial to battling and defeating this virus as the public health measures that we have also been campaigning for. Of course, we’ll need to look at the detail when it is published but today’s announcement is a message again to employers that the government will stand behind them if they stand behind their workers. There should be no rush to redundancies. Politics Live does not normally go in for quizzes, but have a guess who said this, about the Sunak announcement. Today’s announcement is a message again to employers that the government will stand behind them if they stand behind their workers. The answer’s coming in a minute or two, when I’ve written up the full post. Foreign holidays are likely to be cancelled this year, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warned this morning, as he said the public need to prepare for the “reality of life” in a period of physical distancing. Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor have the story. Nicola Sturgeon asked employers north of the border to follow Scottish government guidelines, reiterating that measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are not applicable in Scotland. Speaking at her daily press briefing, the first minister said: I am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis – so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge employees back prematurely. She added that she recognised it was not an option for everyone to work from home and that if the Scottish government were to advise people to return to work then it was “absolutely incumbent” on them to ensure that they were safe in the workplace. She welcomed Rishi Sunak’s extension of the furlough scheme to October, saying that she hoped this would avoid any cliff edge scenario for employers. She was also questioned about BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme, which revealed on Monday evening that the public was not told about an early coronavirus outbreak at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in February. (See 9.31am.) She insisted that “all appropriate steps were taken” to protect public health, including setting up an incident management team and contact tracing, but added that patient confidentiality meant small numbers of cases could not be publicly identified at that time, but that they were included in the regular NHS reporting system. But reporters pointed out that the first positive case recorded for the Edinburgh area was on 7 March, 10 days after the conference. This is from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The Welsh health minister has insisted that he did not break the lockdown at the weekend after he was photographed out and about with his family. Vaughan Gething tweeted: At the Welsh government’s daily press conference he said: I went for a walk with my family as many of us have done over the weekend. My son was on his scooter. We went local to ourselves. We stopped for food on the way. All of those things are within the regulations. There’s absolutely no breach of the guidance or the rules. It’s really disappointing in the middle of a global pandemic when more than 1,100 people have lost their lives in Wales and more to come and difficult complex choices to be made every day to have a deliberately unhelpful inquiry from a journalist from a national newspaper who wants to suggest I have done something wrong when I haven’t. I think that all of us need to be better than this. There’s not a single thing that that journalist is proposing to write that would help save a single life or would help the public with the key message about continuing to follow the lockdown rules. This is from Carys Roberts, executive director of the IPPR thinktank, on the decision to extend the furlough scheme until the end of October. Citizens Advice has responded to the chancellor’s announcement, saying the furlough extension protects households from a financial cliff edge, but people in the shielded group need a right to access the scheme if they can’t work safely. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive, said: Extending the furlough scheme and allowing employers to bring back their workers part-time are sensible steps to protect household finances. The Job Retention Scheme was an unprecedented intervention which has protected jobs and put money in people’s pockets. We have made clear that changes to the scheme would be needed to make sure people don’t face a financial cliff edge. Sadly, we continue to see cases where people in the shielded group are being denied furlough. People in this group need a right to access this scheme if they cannot work safely. Nobody should be forced to choose between paying the bills or protecting their health. And this is from Alison Thewliss, the SNP’s Treasury spokeswoman at Westminster. Wolves are the first club to get Covid-19 testing under the Premier League’s testing plan ahead of the potential resumption of matches. More than 10 members of backroom staff were swabbed on Monday, with plans to test players later this week and at regular intervals thereafter. Full story here: This is from John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, on Sunak’s announcement. This is from Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, on Sunak’s announcement about extending the furlough scheme. The Welsh government will not recommend that its citizens wear face masks. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, had considered the evidence and discussed it with the chief medical officers from the other UK nations. Gething said: He [Atherton] is not recommending that everyone should be wearing face masks; he believes this should be a matter of personal choice. The minister said his government is “concerned” at the different tone from the UK government on the easing of exercise restrictions in England. Ministers are worried people may be tempted to travel from England to visit Welsh beauty spots, which would break the lockdown rules in Wales. Gething said: We think the messaging in England is confused. But he said he did not think closing the border was a “real option”. He said such a move would involve erecting border controls and he was not sure the Welsh government had the power to take such action. He said: What really matters is policing and enforcing the laws, the regulations. Gething also made it clear that it was not acceptable to play golf in Wales – because it usually involves driving to the course. During defence questions in the Commons, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, asked the defence secretary Ben Wallace to summon “an urgent meeting of the National Security Council” which has not met since January to discuss threats from China and Russia at the time of coronavirus. No meeting is also scheduled to take place this week either, as this Guardian report points out, and there are growing concerns in Whitehall that the national security council which met weekly under David Cameron and Theresa May is being allowed to wither. In reply, Wallace said that the decision to call an NSC is “is a matter for the national security directorate within the Cabinet Office and the cabinet and the prime minister”. He added: “It is not the case that by not having it we have no agenda on security.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told the Commons during defence questions that he had offered further military help with the coronavirus crisis in care homes in a morning meeting with Boris Johnson. The cabinet minister told MPs that he wanted to offer care homes “the assistance they need” in “bringing testing to care homes”, or helping with the decontamination of facilities so staff don’t risk bringing the disease to and from the homes during their work. No indication was given as to whether the prime minister had accepted the offer, but Wallace said “we stand ready” to help the Department of Health and Social Care or any other stakeholder as required, as the number of deaths and infections amongst those in care remains high. The BBC’s economics editor, Faisal Islam, says some Conservative thinkers believe a version of the furlough scheme could be with us for good. A study of staff at an NHS hospital has suggested that 3% of staff reporting as fit for duty in April were unknowingly infected with coronavirus. Researchers at Cambridge University swabbed and tested more than 1,200 NHS workers at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge throughout April, with staff also asked about relevant coronavirus symptoms. More than 1,000 workers reported that they were fit for duty during the study period, but 3% of them tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Mike Weekes, one of the authors of the report, said staff need to be tested regularly “regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms”. Under closer questioning as part of the study, around one in five staff reported no symptoms, two in five had very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported Covid-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously. Weekes and his fellow senior author, Prof Stephen Baker, from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease, said hospitals needed to introduce screening programmes across their workforces. Weekes said: Test! Test! Test! And then test some more. All staff need to get tested regularly for Covid-19, regardless of whether they have any sort of symptoms – this will be vital to stop infection spreading within the hospital setting. The study, published in the journal eLife, also explored possible routes of transmission of the virus through the hospital and among staff. Researchers looked at whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in “red” areas of the hospital, caring for Covid-19 patients. Despite wearing appropriate PPE, “red” area staff were three times more likely to test positive than staff working in Covid-19-free “green” areas, the study indicated. It is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of transmission from patients to staff in red areas, as staff may have instead transmitted the virus to each other or acquired it at home. Those working in the “red” areas were also swabbed earlier in the study, closer to when the lockdown was first initiated, so the higher rates of infection in this group might just be a symptom of higher rates of virus circulating in the community at the time. Employers have welcomed the announcement to extend the furlough scheme too. This is from Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. A furlough extension will bring significant relief to employers and workers across the country. We’re delighted the Treasury has taken on the IoD’s consistent calls for a flexible furlough. Many firms will be operating far below normal capacity for the foreseeable future. A part-time furlough provides a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed. A more flexible approach will allow firms to raise activity levels in tandem with demand, helping to avoid cashflow challenges. The TUC has welcomed Sunak’s announcement. This is from Frances O’Grady, its general secretary. We are pleased ministers have listened to unions and extended the job retention scheme to the autumn. This will be a big relief for millions. Changing the rules to allow part-time working is key to enabling a gradual and safe return to work. And maintaining the rate at 80% is a win for the pay packets of working families. As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job. The Conservative MP Cheryl Gillan says British Airways has been threatening to make staff redundant, even though it has been using the furlough scheme. She asks Sunak to condemn this. Sunak says the government will continue to do all it can to protect jobs. In response to a question from Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, about help for the self-employed, Sunak says the scheme already operating for the self-employed is one of the most generous in the world. People will start getting help through it from early next week. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has announced a significant rise in suspected cases of Covid-19 in hospitals overnight – a rise of 165 taking the total of those in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 to 1,618. She emphasised that this increase related to suspected rather than confirmed cases and could well be explained by the new policy of testing older people in hospital. She also announced 15 more deaths registered in the past 24 hours of people who had tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 1,912. These are from Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank focusing on living standards and inequality. Bell, who used to work as a Labour adviser, welcomes Sunak’s decision. In the Commons Sunak seems to have taken MPs by surprise by the scale of his announcement. MPs from all sides have welcomed his decision, and opposition MPs are finding it hard to ask the usual “But why aren’t you doing X as well?” follow-ups. These are from Rishi Sunak summarising his announcement. In the Commons Sunak confirms that the level of support to employees will not be reduced. But employers will be asked to contribute more. He says today’s announcement means the scheme will have run for eight months. In response to his Labour shadow, Anneliese Dodds, Sunak says he has never talked about people being addicted to this scheme. That is not language he backs, he says. And he says he has been consulting with unions about this. Sunak says the government believes in the dignity of work. It is doing all it can to protect people who cannot work. He says he can announce the next stage of the job retention scheme, the furlough scheme. He says 7.5m jobs have been supported, and almost 1m businesses helped. He says the scheme will be extended for four months, until the end of October. (It had been due to end at the end of June.) There will be no changes until the end of July. And in August, September and October it will continue with more flexibility. He says employers will be able to bring workers back part-time. (At the moment the scheme only subsidises workers who are not working at all.) He says the government will require employers to make a contribution. But he says employees will continue to get the same support they do now - 80% of wages. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is now responding to an urgent question in the Commons about the future of his furlough scheme. In his TV address on Sunday night Boris Johnson said that the reproduction number, R, for the UK as a whole was between 0.5 and 0.9. This shows the rate at which coronavirus is spreading. The government’s key priority is to keep it below 1. The Northern Ireland executive has a more specific estimate for R in Northern Ireland. According to its recovery plan document (pdf), it is currently around 0.8. England’s national parks have urged caution for visitors planning to return to beauty spots from Wednesday – with some still telling people to stay away. Updated government rules on the lockdown have relaxed the “stay local” message in England so people can drive to outdoor open spaces “irrespective of distance”, as long as they respect physical distancing guidance and don’t cross borders. However, several national parks are warning people to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid hotspots or busy areas. Visitors are also being warned that many facilities, such as car parks, visitor centres and public toilets, as well as cafes and pubs, are not yet open. The Lake District is urging people not to return yet in order to help communities in Cumbria, which officials said has one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the UK. The National Park Authority chief executive, Richard Leafe, said: For now, we’re asking people not to rush back to the Lake District – help protect our communities, the fells will still be here when this passes. The Yorkshire Dales NPA’s chief executive, David Butterworth, said the government’s approach to reopening the countryside was not one it had advocated: We, along with many organisations with countryside facilities, have advocated a staged approach with an initial ‘stay local’ message to avoid unnecessary travel and minimise any tension between visitors and local communities. But in light of the new rules, authority-run car parks would now be opened and it was working to open toilets as soon as possible, he said, as he asked visitors to respect local communities, nature and other people. Dartmoor national park said it was reviewing how to reopen car parks and toilets and was awaiting further guidance on how to do so while safely supporting social distancing. In a statement it added: Until then please stay at home, avoid unnecessary journeys, exercise locally and follow social distancing and hygiene rules. And Sarah Fowler, the chief executive of the Peak District NPA, issued a personal appeal for anyone planning to travel to the area: Before your journey, carefully consider your own wellbeing and that of the Peak District’s many small communities. Continuing to use local parks and outdoor areas close to home could help the park ensure it can welcome visitors in the coming weeks and not put “undue pressure” on public highways, emergency access or key workers, she added. The UK death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 40,000, according to official figures, with almost 10,000 care home residents now having died from coronavirus, Robert Booth and Caelainn Barr report. Here is an excerpt from the Northern Ireland’s executive’s document (pdf) showing what its five-step plan looks like. The Northern Ireland executive has just published its own coronavirus recovery plan. The 12-page document is here (pdf), and there is a seven-page summary here (pdf). It envisages a five-step route to recovery. PA Media summarises them here. The first step includes groups of four to six people who are not from the same household being able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, drive-through church services, churches opening for private prayer, opening of outdoor spaces and public sport amenities, drive-through cinemas and more sports, including some water activities, golf and tennis. The second step will see groups of 10 being able to meet outdoors, team sports training on a non-contact basis in small groups, re-opening of some libraries and open-air museums, as well as indoor activities involving limited contact of less than 10 minutes and with two to four people. The third step will see groups of up to 30 being able to gather outside, re-opening of more libraries as well as museums and galleries, concert and theatre rehearsals resuming and larger indoor gatherings. The fourth step is set to see socially distanced church services, resumption of competitive sport behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, leisure centres re-opening and outdoor concerts resuming on a restricted basis. The fifth step will include the resumption of close physical contact sports, return of competitive sport, spectators at live events on a restricted basis as well as the re-opening of nightclubs and concerts on a limited basis. However the NI executive has not included dates for when each step of the plan might be reached and warned this will take “significant time”. And here is an extract from the plan. It says: The executive shares the aspiration of all of you - to return to a more normal way of living our lives soon. While this will take significant time, we can guarantee that we will not retain the restrictions for any longer than is absolutely necessary,” the document reads. However it is important that when taking decisions now, we recognise the risk of having to re-introduce restrictions if cases rise sharply again. That is why we will only decide to relax restrictions when we are sure that that is in the long-term interest of the health and wellbeing of the population. Tributes have been paid to an ambulance care assistant who died with coronavirus and who “dedicated his career to serving the public”. Phil Rennie, a patient transport service care assistant for the North West ambulance service based in Oldham, contracted Covid-19 and died at Fairfield general hospital in Bury on Sunday, the service’s chief executive, Daren Mochrie, said: Phil was extremely proud to work for NWAS, offering comfort and care to those in need. He has been part of the NWAS family since 2015 and has dedicated his career to serving the public, previously working in local authority and public services. We have been supporting Phil’s family during this terrible time and they are in the thoughts of everyone here at NWAS - our deepest sympathies go out to them. Phil will be sorely missed by us all. Phil is survived by his wife, Karen, and son, Adam. Boris Johnson would like some primary school children in England to start going back to school from 1 June. Under the provisional plan published yesterday, subject to coronavirus being brought further under control, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils (the youngest and oldest at primary school) would start going back from 1 June, with all primary school pupils back for a month before the summer holidays. But would parents comply? This morning the National Education Union has published the results of a survey of 1,000 parents which suggests that a third of them are not ready to send their children back. According to the NEU, “just under half (49%) said they would, with a third of the total sample (33%) intending to delay the return.” And one parent in that category is Anneliese Dodds, the new shadow chancellor. Dodds, who has a six-year-old and a younger child, was on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour this morning and she was asked if she would be willing to send her oldest back to school on 1 June. At first she gave an evasive answer, saying that her local school was doing “an incredible job” but that the government had not yet published evidence showing it would be safe for children to go back without posting a risk to families and children. Towards the end of the interview the presenter, Jane Garvey, challenged her again, saying she had not answered the question. Would she send her child to school knowing what she does now? Dodds replied: I would be more than happy to send my own child to school if I knew that by doing so I would not be potentially harming others. That’s the critical issue for me. And we don’t have that evidence, I feel, currently. So that’s a no, Garvey suggested. Dodds replied: Well, I don’t feel that I have that evidence now. If government was able to provide that, particularly to publish the scientific information underlying its decisions, we could be in a different situation. As I say, it’s not really about my family. It’s about whether we are spreading this disease more broadly. We don’t have that evidence in front of us now. Some late-morning joy. A doctor who had to miss his daughter’s first birthday due to the coronavirus pandemic said he was “blown away” by the love and kindness of his “incredible” colleagues after they surprised him with a party at the hospital to help celebrate. Dr Rory Nolan, 29, hasn’t seen his wife, Catriona, 26, and daughter Francesca for more than two months after they made the decision to temporarily live apart so he could continue working on the frontline in A&amp;E. Instead of being able to share Francesca’s birthday with her, he spent it working at a Manchester hospital. However, his colleagues stepped in to make sure the day was memorable. Here are some extracts of the thread he posted on Twitter: The doctor also took the opportunity to warn the public that despite the easing of restrictions this week, “Covid is not over” and urged people to follow the rules, if not for themselves then for the sake of others. Care home deaths accounted for about 40% of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending 1 May, with at least 10,535 of all deaths to date taking place outside hospitals, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Of the 6,035 deaths linked to Covid-19 and registered in the week ending 1 May, 2,423 (40%) were in care homes, compared with 3,214 (53%) in hospitals. This weekly number of care home deaths is a slight dip from 2,794 in the previous seven days and is the first week-on-week decrease since 20 March, according to the ONS. The ONS numbers are based on instances where Covid-19 is mentioned anywhere on a death certificate, including in combination with other health conditions. Of all deaths involving coronavirus up to 1 May, 22,873 took place in hospitals, while 10,535 were elsewhere. Of these: - 8,312 took place in care homes - 1,562 were in private homes - 386 occurred in hospices - 142 took place in other communal establishments - 133 happened elsewhere The ONS figures, by date of death, suggest a peak in daily care home deaths may have taken place on 17 April, when 415 deaths occurred. During the following week, daily deaths declined consecutively for all days but one – 22 April, when deaths rose by 20. The corresponding peak for deaths in hospitals is 8 April, when 983 occurred. In the week ending 1 May, there were 17,953 deaths registered across England and Wales – a decrease for the second week running. However, Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the ONS, said this is still around 8,000 deaths above the average for this time of year (see 9.50am.). Speaking to BBC News, he said: That is about 4,000 lower than it was the week before but it is still 8,000 above the average that we would expect to see in this week at this time of year. So it is actually the seventh highest weekly total since this data set started in 1993, so we have had four out of the top seven weeks in the last four weeks. Separate analysis shows there were 8,314 deaths in care homes involving coronavirus reported by care home providers in England to the Care Quality Commission between 10 April and 8 May, according to the ONS. Good morning. I’m Lucy Campbell, joining the blog for the rest of the day. We will be bringing you all the latest updates and analysis on the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, so please do feel free to get in touch throughout the day to share news tips, advice, comments and suggestions. Your ideas are always welcome and apologies if I can’t reply to you all. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Further outbreaks of coronavirus and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions and send people in England back to work without a robust strategy to suppress the virus, an independent group of scientists has warned. The experts, convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, urged ministers to reconsider the “dangerous” strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to clamp down on the epidemic. Prof King set up the “independent Sage” meetings amid concerns around the transparency of independent scientific advice reaching ministers through the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). In a report being published today, the group warns that simply ensuring the NHS is not overwhelmed is “counter-productive” and “potentially dangerous”. Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections “we shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics and face the prospect of further partial or national lockdowns”, the authors write. The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee. The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19, and to replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group call for a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of the outbreak control. The report states that the “over-dependence on outsourcing” is unsustainable. On the Today programme this morning Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should not scale back the coronavirus job retention scheme that allows workers to be furloughed. He said the government should continue to pay 80% of people’s salaries (as it does now, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month), instead of reducing that to 60%, as the Treasury has been considering. Asked what Sunak should do, King said: Keep it at 80%. I don’t think it makes sense to regard this as the major cost of the Covid-19 crisis in economic terms. These payments under government schemes are transfers from taxpayers in general to businesses, it will lead to an increase in national debt [but] we can finance that over a long period, particularly given the very low level of long-term real interest rates. The real cost of this shutdown is not measured by the impact on the public finances but by the lost incomes and outputs in the economy, a cost which is likely to end up as an order of magnitude [though no one can really know this] of several hundred billion pounds. That’s an enormous cost. King also said the “economy ought to have recovered to a very large extent” before Sunak considered ending the furlough scheme in a bid to avoid a wave of redundancies when the support is curtailed. BBC Scotland’s Disclosure programme has revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh in February, well before the first confirmed cases in the country, but that this was not disclosed to the public. Scotland’s first confirmed coronavirus case, in Tayside, was announced on 1 March, but Disclosure, broadcast on Monday night, revealed an outbreak that began the week before, on 26 and 27 February, at a conference of international delegates for the sportswear company Nike. At least 25 people linked to this event have since been confirmed to have been infected, said the programme, eight of them resident in Scotland. Nike told the BBC it instigated enhanced measures, including contact tracing and increased cleaning and disinfection processes in their stores and offices, and that all its staff had now recovered. The Scottish government confirmed health authorities were alerted to the potential outbreak on 2 March. Over the last 24 hours the government has published a huge pile of documents giving advice to the public about what it needs to do now. The UK government has a three-step coronavirus recovery plan. The step one measures apply from tomorrow (13 May). Step two will start on Monday 1 June, or later. And step three will start on Saturday 4 July or later. The advice out this week covers all three steps, although there is more detail about step one. Much of the advice specifically covers just England. The devolved administrations have also been producing their own guidance. Here are the key documents: The 60-page overall plan, entitled “Our plan to rebuild” (pdf). The coronavirus outbreak FAQs - A useful Q&amp;A covering all main topics, and mostly focusing on what is changing this week. Specific guidance on social distancing. Specific guidance on staying safe outside the home. On education specifically, there are at least four documents. They are: A general guide for parents and carers. Specific information about the plan for some pupils to return to school from 1 June. Advice for schools on what they need to do. Specific advice on protective measures. The Department for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy has produced eight separate guides on how to keep employees safe in different workplace environment. You can find links to all eight here. And now, this morning, the Department for Transport has produced transport guidance. There are two main documents: Guidance for passengers. Guidance for operators. (If I’ve left any out, please let me know in the comments below the line.) Public transport users should face away from each other when they cannot keep a 2-metre gap, the government has said. A report from PA Media on the new transport guidance issued by the government this morning (see 9.28am) goes on: New guidance issued by the Department for Transport on how to travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak states that passengers should minimise the time they spend near other people and avoid physical contact with them. It acknowledges that “there may be situations where you can’t keep a suitable distance from people”, such as on busier services or at peak times. The document states: “In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.” It goes on: “The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.” Transport operators are being urged to rearrange, remove or limit seating “to try and ensure social distancing is observed”. This may include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating. Single users of black cabs and minicabs should sit in the back left-hand seat of cars, according to the guidance. The sandwich chain Subway has today started a phased reopening of around 600 of its 2,600 stores across the UK and Ireland – approximately one in four – for takeway and delivery only. The outlets have all been fitted with new operational and social distancing safety measures to protect customers, third-party delivery and supplier drivers and staff. These have been tested in the small number of stores that have remained open to support and serve key workers and hospital staff. All NHS workers will receive 25% off their orders, in addition to other initiatives which include free delivery on all third-party orders over £10. The chain joins KFC, Pret a Manger and Burger King in reopening stores, and McDonald’s is poised to trial 15 outlets for delivery from tomorrow. The Office for National Statistics has just published its latest weekly death figures for England and Wales. They go up to the week ending Friday 1 May (or week 18, as the ONS calls it). The ONS figures lag behind the daily figures published by the government, because they are based on registered deaths. But they are more comprehensive. The daily government figures just count people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. The ONS figures for coronavirus deaths include all those where it was mentioned on the death certificate, which often happens if a patient had symptoms but did not test positive. The figures show that by the end of April coronavirus deaths were falling, but total excess deaths (ie, the number of weekly deaths above what you would expect in an average week) was still very high. Here are the main points. Excess deaths in England and Wales were running at around 8,000 at the end of April. There were 8,012 more deaths in week 18 than the five-year average for that time of year. Overall there were 17,953 deaths that week. In the previous week there were 11,539 excess deaths. For the second week in a row overall deaths were down. Coronavirus deaths in week 18 accounted for 33.6% of all deaths, down from 37.4% in the previous weeks. Deaths in care homes were also down in week 18. There were 6,409. But 37.8% of those deaths involved coronavirus, up from 35.3% the previous week. All regions showed a decrease in the proportion of deaths involving coronavirus in week 18. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has just published the new advice being issued to passengers using public transport. It’s here. A railway ticket office worker has died of Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty, as a union calls for a government compensation scheme for bereaved families of frontline employees to be extended to cover transport staff. Belly Mujinga, 47, was on the concourse of Victoria station in London in March when a man who said he had Covid-19 spat and coughed at her and a colleague. Within days of the assault, both women fell ill with coronavirus. Mujinga, who had underlying respiratory problems, was admitted to Barnet Hospital and put on a ventilator but died on 5 April, her trade union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), said. Just 10 people were allowed to attend her funeral. The union has reported the incident to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail (ORR), for investigation and is taking legal advice on the situation. TSSA says there are questions to answer as to why Mujinga was not stood down from duty earlier given her underlying health condition. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: “We are shocked and devastated at Belly’s death. She is one of far too many frontline workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, recently announced that £60,000 would be paid to the survivors of health and care workers who die as a result of the pandemic. Our view is that this compensation should be extended to the families of all frontline workers who perish trying to keep our country and vital services going. Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them. However, there are serious questions about her death; it wasn’t inevitable. As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category, and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why she wasn’t stood down from frontline duties early on in this pandemic. In an interview with Sky News, Mujinga’s husband, Lusamba Gode Katalay, said: “They weren’t given masks, or gloves, so they were exposed to everyone. “It’s her employer, the company and the state who have to look at that. Me and Ingrid [his 11-year-old daughter] we saw Belly, on 2 April when she left for hospital. Then we didn’t see her again. “She’s dead and we buried her without being able to see her.” Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. It’s going to be a busy day. Here are the main items on the agenda. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes its latest weekly death figures. 9.30am: Health and Safety Executive officials give evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee about workplace safety. 11.30am: The Northern Ireland executive publishes its plan for relaxing the lockdown. 12pm: The “independent Sage” convened by the former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King publishes its recommendations to government. 12.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs about his plans to extend the furlough scheme. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily press briefings. 1pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 1.15pm: Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about safety guidance for businesses. After 2pm: Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about safety guidance for those operating public transport. 2.30pm: Prison Service officials and the prisons minister Lucy Frazer give evidence to the Commons justice committee. 5pm: Sharma is expected to take the UK government’s daily press conference. The number of people dying in care homes has nearly halved in the past few weeks, according to Matt Hancock as he rejected the accusations that the adult and social care sector is being let down by the government. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I’m really pleased that the number of people dying in care homes is now falling, quite sharply. The number has almost halved over the past two to three weeks, since the peak. It’s very clear to me that the transmission in care homes is coming down and is much lower than it was. It comes as new figures are set to be released on care home fatalities, with the Office for National Statistics previously revealing that there were 5,890 coronavirus-related care home deaths registered up to 24 April in England and Wales. Meanwhile, yesterday figures were released showing that women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles. Defending the government’s role in handling the crisis in care homes, Hancock added: Some of our most vulnerable people live in care homes and yet only around a quarter of the deaths that have happened have been in care homes. That’s much lower than most international comparators. Matt Hancock has defended new rules that allow people to meet one parent but not both at the same time, as he rejected claims the new lockdown measures had sowed confusion. For the first time since the lockdown was imposed in March, from tomorrow people will be able to meet a single member from another household in a public place so long as they maintain physical distancing. However, the new rules prevent a person from meeting both parents at the same time. Asked what was wrong with someone seeing both their parents so long as they were 2 metres apart, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: These things are a judgment and what we don’t want is large groups of people gathering and you have to make a judgment as to what is reasonable and where to set the rules. And it’s perfectly reasonable to have a rule that only one individual can meet up with one other at that 2 metre distance, and outside is safer than inside because the science is clear that outside, although the risks are not zero, there is a lower risk to people being approximate outside. Therefore, a rule that you can only meet up with one other person just protects everybody against that burgeoning into large groups of people. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the reproduction rate of Covid-19 in the UK is “broadly in the middle of the range” of 0.5 to 0.9, insisting it is definitely below one. Speaking in an earlier interview on Sky News, Hancock said cleaners entering people’s homes should exercise social distancing rules and follow other good practices, such as washing their hands regularly. Challenged on why grandparents could not see their grandchildren but children could see their carers, Hancock said it was a “scientific fact” that older people were more vulnerable to Covid-19. He added: The principles are really clear and the public has been sensible so far. The Great British public have really understood what social distancing means, why we need to do it … the principles are: outside is better than inside, stay 2 metres away, wash your hands and clean the surfaces, and see as few people as you can outside of your household because that virus spreads but we do also at the same time need to get people back to work.” The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, has called for the government’s furlough scheme to continue, saying: “It can’t be reduced.” The economy would not recover if people were forced back to work too soon, Rayner said, arguing that it should go on “as long as we need it”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: We can’t afford not to do it correctly. I think it is really important the chancellor continues with the good practice of making sure that furlough scheme is in place and doesn’t try and reduce it too soon, because that will cost us in the longer term. Many families wouldn’t be able to survive right now if it wasn’t for things like the furlough scheme. It is absolutely right the government has stepped in but they can’t now pull the rug from underneath people’s feet - they have to continue to support people throughout this crisis. We will have to look at how the economy recovers, but it is not going to recover quickly enough if we pull the rug from people now and people end up destitute and we end up having that R rate spiking again and back in lockdown. Later today, chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme under which the government has been subsidising the wages of workers temporarily laid off due to the pandemic. Matt Hancock has dodged questions on whether people have a legal right not to work if they do not feel safe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There are major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, and industry figures have said the mental health impacts of returning to a new “alien environment” are not being prioritised. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether or not someone has a legal right not to go to work if they do not feel their workplace is safe, Hancock declined to give a direct answer twice. Asked the first time, he replied: Well this needs to be a collaborative effort. Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important … Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home because obviously that’s the safest way to work. Pressed again on whether they would have a legal right not to work if they felt unsafe, he said: “Well, employment law has not changed but that isn’t the point. The point is that businesses and their employees should be working together … to make the best of what is a very difficult situation.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has rejected the idea that meeting a friend in someone’s garden is safer than doing so in a park, as he sought to defend the new lockdown easing measures set to come into force tomorrow. From Wednesday, people will be able to meet one member from a different household in a public place at two metres distance for the first time since the lockdown was imposed. But the minister rejected a viewer’s suggestion that it was safer to meet a friend in their garden rather than a busy park. The viewer’s question, which was read out to Hancock on BBC Breakfast said: “Can I have a friend round in my garden if we stay two metres apart, surely it’s more safe than meeting them in a park with more people?” But Hancock fired back: “It’s not necessarily more safe than meeting in a park and we’ve said that that should only happen in public places…” Asked why it is not as safe, Hancock continued: For instance, lots of people can only get to their garden by going through their house, being with people indoors is not as safe as outdoors and so that’s why we’ve come to this judgment. And it is a balanced judgment that that is best done in a park or in a public place. We brought that in so that people can see others from outside their household but also without encouraging large groups to gather and encouraging things that the scientists tell us would increase the risk of the spread of the virus. Ryanair has announced a plan to restore 40% of its flights from 1 July but warned the move was dependent on EU flight restrictions being lifted, as well as public health measures imposed at airports. The airline said the measure is subject to government restrictions on flights within the EU being lifted and “effective public health measures” being implemented at airports. It would involve nearly 1,000 flights per day being operated and 90% of its pre-Covid-19 route network being restored. Crew and passengers will also be required to wear face masks and pass temperature checks. Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson said: It is important for our customers and our people that we return to some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. Governments around Europe have implemented a four-month lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. “After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work and restart Europe’s tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs.” Good morning readers, it’s Simon Murphy here kicking off the UK live blog today to bring you the latest developments this morning as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. With the UK’s Covid-19 death toll topping 32,000 yesterday, the UK’s easing of lockdown measures comes into effect tomorrow although the move has sowed confusion. Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of failing to give the public “clear directions” on the way through the coronavirus crisis, as the government struggled to answer a barrage of questions about its new advice to “stay alert”. Later on today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will speak in the commons where he is expected to announce an extension to the furlough scheme under which the Government subsidises the wages of workers temporarily laid off due to the pandemic. The Business and Transport Secretaries will also make statements. There are also briefings expected in Scotland and Wales at 1230.

    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>
    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>

     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>

    </ul>
    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>

Hours later Italy, which has the third highest number of cases worldwide, announced its deaths from the virus had jumped 18 to 52. Indonesia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal, Jordan, Iceland, Tunisia, Senegal, Saudi Arabia and Andorra all confirmed their first cases as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned global economic growth rates could be slashed. Official statistics indicate that within the EU, the European economic area and the UK, 2,199 people have so far contracted the Covid-19 virus. Across the world, about 89,000 are believed to be infected. “While we should not give in to panic, the situation is likely to get worse,” the European commissioner for crisis management, Janez Lenarčič, said of the unfolding epidemic. During a press conference in Brussels, Von der Leyen expressed her “full sympathy for those who are suffering” as she launched a coronavirus response team of commissioners to coordinate efforts to stem infection and deal with the economic fall out.

In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the <a href=""https://www.rics.org/uk/"">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a>. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side.<br><br>Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members’ fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its <a href=""https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/valuation/red-book/"">Red Book</a>, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities"">triumphant bonfire of red tape</a>, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation.

In his urgent new book, <a href=""https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/the-property-lobby"">The Property Lobby</a>, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper – at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f/0_0_6924_4537/1000.jpg"" alt=""Taking action ...

His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led <a href=""https://coinstreet.org/"">Coin Street housing project</a> on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Property-Machine-Penguin-special/dp/0140523030"">The Property Machine</a>, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people’s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force.<br><br>Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the “finance-housebuilding complex”, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--thumbnail"" data-media-id=""1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29/0_0_1500_2368/633.jpg"" alt=""The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt."" width=""633"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/more-than-1m-families-waiting-for-social-housing-in-england"">council house waiting lists</a> and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty – not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic – but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright"">delivered through “planning gain”</a>. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the “regeneration” of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/winners-and-losers-london-social-housing-divide-barnet-camden"">break-up of communities</a>. It’s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to “the ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.”<br><br>Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/berkeleygroupholdings"">Berkeley Group</a>, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes – proudly described as “popular with overseas investors” – was £715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company’s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of £48m in 2018, after a previous payout of £23m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/03/berkeley-calls-affordable-housing-targets-unviable-as-chairman-earns-174m"">local authority targets were “unviable”</a>. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than <a href=""https://www.building.co.uk/news/berkeley-profit-hit/5100149.article"">£3bn</a>.<br><br>As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-launches-panel-of-experts-to-kick-start-estates-regeneration"">Michael Heseltine’s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel</a> in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the <a href=""https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/news-and-insights/news/2014/berkeley-wins-queens-award-for-sustainable-development"">Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014</a>. The next year, Pidgley <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/apr/01/tory-100-industry-captains-party-donors-tax-avoiders"">gave a donation to the Conservative party</a> and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d/0_107_4292_2574/1000.jpg"" alt=""Steering profits ...

Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: David Levene/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/01/help-to-buy-pushes-uk-housebuilder-dividends-to-23bn"">government subsidy through Help to Buy</a>, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright"">dodge their affordable housing obligations</a>. The <a href=""http://www.cih.org/"">Chartered Institute for Housing</a> estimated that of the total £53bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus"">CEO Jeff Fairburn a £75m bonus</a>, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process.<br><br>All of this is great news for the <a href=""https://www.hbf.co.uk/"">Home Builders Federation</a>, the powerful volume housebuilders’ lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright"">viability assessment</a>” of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/31/britain-land-housing-crisis-developers-not-building-land-banking"">land-banking</a> and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits.<br><br>The list of powerful interests goes on. There is <a href=""https://www.cla.org.uk/"">the CLA</a> (formerly the Country Landowners’ Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that <a href=""https://www.progressive-policy.net/press-releases/press-release-landowners-make-13bn-profit-in-one-year-as-high-land-prices-stifle-affordable-housing"">landowners in England made a £13bn profit from land sales in 2016-17</a>, <a href=""https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income"">far more than Amazon’s net annual global profit in the same period, or since</a>. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a “Stalinist land grab” or a “garden tax”.<br><br>Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/revolving-door-between-councils-and-lobbyists-raises-transparency-issues"">revolving doors between councils and developers</a>, to the culture of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/tory-westminster-councillor-resigns-after-hospitality-inquiry"">hospitality and political donations</a>, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities"">riddle the planning system</a> – which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers’ profits.<br><br>There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, “part of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right”. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry – a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed.<br><br>Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the <a href=""https://righttobuildtoolkit.org.uk/briefing-notes/different-ways-to-bring-forward-land/"">examples of Germany and the Netherlands</a>, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators.<br><br>He says it is finally time to tax developers’ land banks and <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25396103"">implement “use or lose it” measures</a>, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission.

In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side. Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members’ fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its Red Book, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a triumphant bonfire of red tape, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as “unlocking the inherent value held within the world’s physical assets”, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out? In the eyes of Bob Colenutt, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, The Property Lobby, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper – at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it. Many books have attempted to explain the roots of Britain’s housing crisis, but Colenutt is better placed than most to unpick the mess. His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led Coin Street housing project on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored The Property Machine, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people’s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force. Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the “finance-housebuilding complex”, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests. Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on council house waiting lists and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty – not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic – but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be delivered through “planning gain”. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the “regeneration” of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the break-up of communities. It’s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to “the ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.” Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. Berkeley Group, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes – proudly described as “popular with overseas investors” – was £715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company’s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of £48m in 2018, after a previous payout of £23m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the local authority targets were “unviable”. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than £3bn. As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of Michael Heseltine’s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014. The next year, Pidgley gave a donation to the Conservative party and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies. Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by government subsidy through Help to Buy, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to dodge their affordable housing obligations. The Chartered Institute for Housing estimated that of the total £53bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its CEO Jeff Fairburn a £75m bonus, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process. All of this is great news for the Home Builders Federation, the powerful volume housebuilders’ lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the “viability assessment” of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of land-banking and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits. The list of powerful interests goes on. There is the CLA (formerly the Country Landowners’ Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that landowners in England made a £13bn profit from land sales in 2016-17, far more than Amazon’s net annual global profit in the same period, or since. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a “Stalinist land grab” or a “garden tax”. Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the revolving doors between councils and developers, to the culture of hospitality and political donations, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that riddle the planning system – which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers’ profits. There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, “part of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right”. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry – a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed. Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the examples of Germany and the Netherlands, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators. He says it is finally time to tax developers’ land banks and implement “use or lose it” measures, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already beginning to take the lead, in spite of central government policy. As the Coin Street Community Builders’ slogan puts it: “There is another way.” Seeing the stark reality spelled out in such clear terms in this book, there is no longer any excuse not to act.

In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side. Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members’ fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its Red Book, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a triumphant bonfire of red tape, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as “unlocking the inherent value held within the world’s physical assets”, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out? In the eyes of Bob Colenutt, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, The Property Lobby, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper – at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it. Many books have attempted to explain the roots of Britain’s housing crisis, but Colenutt is better placed than most to unpick the mess. His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led Coin Street housing project on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored The Property Machine, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people’s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force. Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the “finance-housebuilding complex”, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests. Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on council house waiting lists and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty – not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic – but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be delivered through “planning gain”. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the “regeneration” of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the break-up of communities. It’s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to “the ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.” Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. Berkeley Group, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes – proudly described as “popular with overseas investors” – was £715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company’s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of £48m in 2018, after a previous payout of £23m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the local authority targets were “unviable”. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than £3bn. As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of Michael Heseltine’s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014. The next year, Pidgley gave a donation to the Conservative party and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies. Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by government subsidy through Help to Buy, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to dodge their affordable housing obligations. The Chartered Institute for Housing estimated that of the total £53bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its CEO Jeff Fairburn a £75m bonus, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process. All of this is great news for the Home Builders Federation, the powerful volume housebuilders’ lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the “viability assessment” of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of land-banking and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits. The list of powerful interests goes on. There is the CLA (formerly the Country Landowners’ Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that landowners in England made a £13bn profit from land sales in 2016-17, far more than Amazon’s net annual global profit in the same period, or since. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop.

Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a “Stalinist land grab” or a “garden tax”. Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the revolving doors between councils and developers, to the culture of hospitality and political donations, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that riddle the planning system – which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers’ profits. There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas.

Refugees have reported food and water shortages. French authorities are distributing bottled water but it is understood they are concerned that too many water points in the camps will hinder physical distancing. Provision of showers and phone charging facilities have also decreased.</p> \n<p>NGOs working in the camps in Calais say it is crucial that the lockdown is managed properly and that the French authorities work with them, as they are trusted by the refugees.</p> \n<p>Clare Moseley, founder of <a href=""https://care4calais.org/news/urgent-appeal-food-please-share/"">Care4Calais,</a> which provides emergency aid and support for refugees in Calais and Dunkirk as well as in Brussels, and is continuing to operate in the refugee areas, said: “We haven’t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the camps. The refugees are more focused on survival than on the virus. We don’t know how ‘voluntary’ the accommodation centres will be.</p> \n<p>“Food supplies in the camps have reduced significantly and if it’s the only way people can get food, they may feel forced to go. The reduction of food in the camps has been a game-changer. If the only way people can eat is by going into one of the centres then it won’t really be voluntary.”</p> \n<p>She said that after getting legal advice from lawyers in the UK and France, Care4Calais volunteers are continuing to operate as frontline aid workers and are following current World Health Organization guidance on infection control.</p> \n<p>According to documents seen by the Guardian, some unaccompanied minors have reported being beaten by French police and they have told charity workers they prefer to sleep in the camps rather than in centres provided by the French authorities.</p> \n<p>When buses are sent to the camps from Tuesday, migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being transferred. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of France, which has prohibited all movement except for essential work, essential shopping, medical appointments and a daily maximum one-hour exercise routine not more than 1km from home.</p> \n<p>Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the refugee camps was grim. Volunteers said that asking migrants who were often four or five to a tent to maintain social distancing was impossible.</p> \n<p>Léah Njeim, a volunteer with Utopia 56, an organisation that distributes food to the camps, told <a href=""https://www.ouest-france.fr/sante/virus/coronavirus/comment-se-confiner-quand-est-migrant-calais-6791752"">Ouest France</a>: “Some migrants are more than an hour’s walk away from running water.”</p> \n<p>Utopia 56 had been transporting sick migrants to local health centres. “We’ve had to stop this ... the police are blocking the exit to the Jungle [camp],” Njeim added.</p> \n<p>Secours Catholique, a charity that ran a day centre for 250 to 300 migrants where they could warm up, have a hot drink and charge their mobiles, said it had been forced to close as most of its volunteers were aged over 70 and in the coronavirus “at risk” group. In an open letter to the authorities, 18 NGOs called for the migrants who wished to stay in the Channel area to be housed in “hotels, schools and empty apartments”.</p> \n<p>“To stay home, you have to have a home to stay in,” the organisations wrote in the <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/mais-pour-rester-chez-soi-il-faut-un-chez-soi"">petition</a> addressed to the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe.</p> \n<p>François Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants, told La Voix du Nord newspaper: “Giving them accommodation far away will not work.

Many NGOs, which provide food and other support to refugees in the camps, have pulled out because of the pandemic. Refugees have reported food and water shortages. French authorities are distributing bottled water but it is understood they are concerned that too many water points in the camps will hinder physical distancing. Provision of showers and phone charging facilities have also decreased. NGOs working in the camps in Calais say it is crucial that the lockdown is managed properly and that the French authorities work with them, as they are trusted by the refugees. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, which provides emergency aid and support for refugees in Calais and Dunkirk as well as in Brussels, and is continuing to operate in the refugee areas, said: “We haven’t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the camps. The refugees are more focused on survival than on the virus. We don’t know how ‘voluntary’ the accommodation centres will be. “Food supplies in the camps have reduced significantly and if it’s the only way people can get food, they may feel forced to go. The reduction of food in the camps has been a game-changer. If the only way people can eat is by going into one of the centres then it won’t really be voluntary.” She said that after getting legal advice from lawyers in the UK and France, Care4Calais volunteers are continuing to operate as frontline aid workers and are following current World Health Organization guidance on infection control. According to documents seen by the Guardian, some unaccompanied minors have reported being beaten by French police and they have told charity workers they prefer to sleep in the camps rather than in centres provided by the French authorities. When buses are sent to the camps from Tuesday, migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being transferred. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of France, which has prohibited all movement except for essential work, essential shopping, medical appointments and a daily maximum one-hour exercise routine not more than 1km from home. Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the refugee camps was grim. Volunteers said that asking migrants who were often four or five to a tent to maintain social distancing was impossible. Léah Njeim, a volunteer with Utopia 56, an organisation that distributes food to the camps, told Ouest France: “Some migrants are more than an hour’s walk away from running water.” Utopia 56 had been transporting sick migrants to local health centres. “We’ve had to stop this ... the police are blocking the exit to the Jungle [camp],” Njeim added. Secours Catholique, a charity that ran a day centre for 250 to 300 migrants where they could warm up, have a hot drink and charge their mobiles, said it had been forced to close as most of its volunteers were aged over 70 and in the coronavirus “at risk” group. In an open letter to the authorities, 18 NGOs called for the migrants who wished to stay in the Channel area to be housed in “hotels, schools and empty apartments”. “To stay home, you have to have a home to stay in,” the organisations wrote in the petition addressed to the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe. François Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants, told La Voix du Nord newspaper: “Giving them accommodation far away will not work. Some will not get in the buses and there will be people who return soon afterwards.” Sources close to the French government told the Guardian that health protection and sheltering arrangements for refugees in the camps were under way.', 'charCount': '5727', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/dianetaylor"">Diane Taylor</a> and <a href=""profile/kim-willsher"">Kim Willsher</a>'}","[{'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/calais', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Calais', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/calais', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/refugees', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Refugees', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/refugees', 'references': []}, {'id': 'science/infectiousdiseases', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'science', 'sectionName': 'Science', 'webTitle': 'Infectious diseases', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/science/infectiousdiseases', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/europe-news', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Europe', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/europe-news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/immigration', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'Immigration and asylum', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/immigration', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/dianetaylor', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Diane Taylor', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dianetaylor', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/dianetaylor', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Diane \nTaylor is a journalist who writes for the Guardian.

</figure>","<p>Up to 2,100 refugees in Calais and Dunkirk are facing an imminent coronavirus lockdown by French authorities, with many saying they will try to reach the UK rather than go to accommodation centres if their camps are cleared.</p> 
<p>Buses will be sent to the camps to transfer refugees to centres housing up to 100 people from Tuesday. The transfers are said to be voluntary but some of the refugees told the Guardian that they distrust the police and are fearful of being forced into the centres, so plan to run away and continue in their attempts to cross the Channel.</p>

    <p><b>Why did Calais become a staging post?</b><br></p>
    <p>Refugees have been gathering in Calais on their way to the UK for decades. Periodically the French authorities attempt to prevent them from coming but asylum seekers continue to arrive. Some pay people-smugglers to get them into lorries parked near the port while those who have no money try to conceal themselves in moving trucks.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Who travels to camps on the Channel? </b></p>
    <p>Many asylum seekers have relatives or friends in the UK or have some level of English language skills. But the 1,000 or so refugees currently living in Calais and Dunkirk represent a very small proportion of refugees seeking asylum across Europe.<br></p>
    <p>Although the situation in Northern France attracts attention because it is at the UK border, the numbers gathered here are tiny compared with the 100,000- plus who arrived in Europe in 2017, the vast majority of whom intend to claim asylum elsewhere in Europe.</p>
    <p><b>What are politicians doing to change the situation?</b></p>
    <p>The British government has contributed to a £17m joint Anglo-French package of security measures, including the construction of a 1km-long concrete wall, aimed at preventing asylum seekers from getting close lorries arriving at the port.</p>
    <p>But charities say extra security does not prevent the arrival of new refugees. They want the British government to make it easier for vulnerable unaccompanied children to travel legally and for France to accept that there will always be some refugees in Calais, and provide dignified reception centres.</p>

<p>Conditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps.</p> 
<p>Many refugees – mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan – often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.</p> 
<p>While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw.</p> 
<p>A 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. “If we are taken away to these centres we won’t know what will happen to us,” he said. “I will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry.

    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>
    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>
     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>
     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>
     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>
     <li>Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>
    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>

Romanian prisoners kept in solitary confinement under <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/10/-sp-ceausescus-children"">the Ceausescu regime</a> share poetry with each other in Morse code, by tapping, coughing or moving their chairs so that they squeak. Siberian prisoners make ink from blackberries so they can write down poems they remember from school. An imprisoned professor of English writes his lectures on string, tying knots for each letter. A 16-year-old prisoner teaches herself English by scratching newly learned words on stolen scraps of soap. These heartening tales put our own troubles into proportion. They show us that the human will, and our inescapably social instincts, usually find a way.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--inline""> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes we need to hunker down just as nature does, paring back to the basics of existence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those who are social distancing, and sitting out the crisis, may find cheer in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/wintering-how-i-learned-to-flourish-when-life-became-frozen-katherine-may-memoir-review"">Katherine May’s recent book, </a><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/wintering-how-i-learned-to-flourish-when-life-became-frozen-katherine-may-memoir-review"">Wintering: </a>How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen</strong>. Wintering, for May, entails “the active acceptance of sadness”. Sometimes we need to hunker down just as nature does, paring back to the basics of existence so we can thrive in sunnier days. Wintering is a time of dormancy, rest and renewal – a time for taking stock and reassessing our priorities. Anything we might achieve is a bonus, not a demand. It may even be a relief to shake off the burden of instant fulfilment and embrace the longer view. “This is the easy time, there is nothing doing,” as Sylvia Plath writes in her <a href=""https://genius.com/Sylvia-plath-wintering-annotated"">poem “Wintering”.</a> “This is the time of hanging on for the bees.”</p> <p>One good thing, perhaps, is that our crisis is not happening in an actual winter. The open spaces of the countryside will be safe and reviving.

Spring is here, even in the time of coronavirus, and they can’t touch you for it.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/25/got-150-hours-great-audiobooks-to-listen-to-on-lockdown"">Got 150 hours?

The Turkish journalist Ahmet Altan wrote I Will Never See the World Again while serving a life sentence on trumped-charges of treason. This wise and defiant book, composed in a tiny shared cell and smuggled out in notes to his lawyers, celebrates the power of words to dissolve human isolation. “Like all writers, I have magic,” Altan writes. “I can pass through your walls with ease.” Irina Dumitrescu’s edited collection Rumba Under Fire – available to download free from Punctum – is full of stories of people still managing to write, teach and learn in the cruellest circumstances. Romanian prisoners kept in solitary confinement under the Ceausescu regime share poetry with each other in Morse code, by tapping, coughing or moving their chairs so that they squeak. Siberian prisoners make ink from blackberries so they can write down poems they remember from school. An imprisoned professor of English writes his lectures on string, tying knots for each letter. A 16-year-old prisoner teaches herself English by scratching newly learned words on stolen scraps of soap. These heartening tales put our own troubles into proportion. They show us that the human will, and our inescapably social instincts, usually find a way. Those who are social distancing, and sitting out the crisis, may find cheer in Katherine May’s recent book, Wintering: How I Learned to Flourish When Life Became Frozen. Wintering, for May, entails “the active acceptance of sadness”. Sometimes we need to hunker down just as nature does, paring back to the basics of existence so we can thrive in sunnier days. Wintering is a time of dormancy, rest and renewal – a time for taking stock and reassessing our priorities. Anything we might achieve is a bonus, not a demand. It may even be a relief to shake off the burden of instant fulfilment and embrace the longer view. “This is the easy time, there is nothing doing,” as Sylvia Plath writes in her poem “Wintering”. “This is the time of hanging on for the bees.” One good thing, perhaps, is that our crisis is not happening in an actual winter. The open spaces of the countryside will be safe and reviving. For instructions on how to enjoy them, read George Orwell’s essay “Some Thoughts on the Common Toad”, published in April 1946, after a long winter which Orwell had feared might be permanent. “By retaining one’s childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies, and … toads, one makes a peaceful and decent future a little more probable,” Orwell writes. “At any rate, spring is here, even in London N1, and they can’t stop you enjoying it.” Dark times shouldn’t stop us living our lives and taking joy where we can find it. Spring is here, even in the time of coronavirus, and they can’t touch you for it. And since the “blitz spirit” keeps being evoked, perhaps you should read Angus Calder’s The Myth of the Blitz to ward against glib or invidious comparisons. Then try Pat Barker’s novel Noonday, set in the actual blitz, or Denton Welch’s story “Memories of a Vanished Period”, about the hedonistic habits of young Londoners during a bombing raid. You will learn that our predecessors, in times of great danger, were just as conflicted, as humanly flawed, and as freaked out, as we are.', 'charCount': '4595', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/joemoran"">Joe Moran</a>'}","[{'id': 'books/series/further-reading', 'type': 'series', 'sectionId': 'books', 'sectionName': 'Books', 'webTitle': 'Further reading', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/further-reading', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/further-reading', 'references': [], 'description': '<p>In this \nweekly Review column, authors select their favourite fiction and \nnon-fiction books to help you understand something in the news or on our\n minds</p>'}, {'id': 'books/books', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'books', 'sectionName': 'Books', 'webTitle': 'Books', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/books', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books', 'references': []}, {'id': 'books/healthmindandbody', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'books', 'sectionName': 'Books', 'webTitle': 'Health, mind and body books', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/healthmindandbody', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/books/healthmindandbody', 'references': []}, {'id': 'books/fiction', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'books', 'sectionName': 'Books', 'webTitle': 'Fiction', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction', 'references': []}, {'id': 'books/poetry', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'books', 'sectionName': 'Books', 'webTitle': 'Poetry', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/books/poetry', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'culture/culture', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'culture', 'sectionName': 'Culture', 'webTitle': 'Culture', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/features', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Features', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/joemoran', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Joe Moran', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joemoran', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/joemoran', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Joe Moran is professor of English and cultural history at Liverpool John Moores University.

Therein lies the external truth about banks’ credit provisioning: the numbers are guesswork – and now more so than ever. Dimon is as much in the dark as everyone else.</p> <p>JP Morgan can, of course, easily absorb its provisions. Even after the $8.3bn (£6.5bn) charge, the bank recorded profits of $2.9bn. Only a few bricks have been dislodged from the “fortress” balance sheet the bank never fails to mention.</p> <p>Yet stock market investors, you would think, might pause for reflection at this point. Share prices have rallied hard for two weeks on the assumption that lockdowns will soon be over and governments’ stimulus packages will ensure a rapid return to normal economic life. The script looks highly speculative and JP Morgan, a supposed bellwether of the US economy, isn’t giving any reliable signals in support. Rather, even $8bn could be just the first course.</p> <h2>New Centrica boss must offer something new</h2> <p>The chief executive’s gig at Centrica used to be a big job in UK plc. The owner of British Gas would usually be able to pluck a high-flyer from the ranks of a major oil and gas company; Iain Conn, chief until last month, had been head of BP’s downstream operations.</p> <p>These days succession planning seems to be more of an on-the-hoof affair. Conn was originally supposed to stay until the summer while a new recruit was found, but finance director Chris O’Shea was installed as a stand-in a few weeks ago. Now O’Shea has got the job permanently because Scott Wheway, himself a newbie as chairman, says he is “comprehensively the best candidate”.</p> <p>Maybe he is. But the internal promotion of the finance director, even one who has been in post for only 18 months, probably isn’t going to satisfy those investors who think Centrica is in urgent need of a shakeup, which usually means an outsider.</p> <p>You can see any appearance of continuity would not appeal. On Conn’s five-year watch, the share price fell from 280p to today’s 33p. With a stock market value of just £2bn, Centrica is heading out of the FTSE 100 index unless<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/british-gas-braces-for-steep-drop-in-revenues-because-of-coronavirus""> the battered share price doubles by June</a>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""Sign up to the daily Business Today\xa0email"">  <iframe src=""https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887"" height=""52px"" data-form-title=""Sign up for Business Today"" data-form-description=""Get the headlines and editors\' picks every weekday morning."" scrolling=""no"" seamless frameborder=""0"" class=""iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article"" data-form-success-desc=""Thanks for signing up""></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>O’Shea – who knows? – may turn out to be a brilliant appointment.

The provision was taken because of “the likelihood of a fairly severe recession”, which is stating the obvious, but then his finance director said the reserves “could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter”. In other words, the financial damage could be a lot worse than JP Morgan’s first assessment. Therein lies the external truth about banks’ credit provisioning: the numbers are guesswork – and now more so than ever. Dimon is as much in the dark as everyone else. JP Morgan can, of course, easily absorb its provisions. Even after the $8.3bn (£6.5bn) charge, the bank recorded profits of $2.9bn. Only a few bricks have been dislodged from the “fortress” balance sheet the bank never fails to mention. Yet stock market investors, you would think, might pause for reflection at this point. Share prices have rallied hard for two weeks on the assumption that lockdowns will soon be over and governments’ stimulus packages will ensure a rapid return to normal economic life. The script looks highly speculative and JP Morgan, a supposed bellwether of the US economy, isn’t giving any reliable signals in support. Rather, even $8bn could be just the first course. New Centrica boss must offer something new The chief executive’s gig at Centrica used to be a big job in UK plc. The owner of British Gas would usually be able to pluck a high-flyer from the ranks of a major oil and gas company; Iain Conn, chief until last month, had been head of BP’s downstream operations. These days succession planning seems to be more of an on-the-hoof affair. Conn was originally supposed to stay until the summer while a new recruit was found, but finance director Chris O’Shea was installed as a stand-in a few weeks ago. Now O’Shea has got the job permanently because Scott Wheway, himself a newbie as chairman, says he is “comprehensively the best candidate”. Maybe he is. But the internal promotion of the finance director, even one who has been in post for only 18 months, probably isn’t going to satisfy those investors who think Centrica is in urgent need of a shakeup, which usually means an outsider. You can see any appearance of continuity would not appeal. On Conn’s five-year watch, the share price fell from 280p to today’s 33p. With a stock market value of just £2bn, Centrica is heading out of the FTSE 100 index unless the battered share price doubles by June. O’Shea – who knows? – may turn out to be a brilliant appointment. But his day-one reference to “structural simplification” (code for selling the oil and gas production assets plus the 20% stake in outage-prone nuclear generator British Energy) and the pursuit of growth in “customer facing businesses” was straight from Conn’s playbook. If he has something different to offer, O’Shea would be advised to reveal it at an early opportunity. The banking bonuses battle is coming Don’t weep too hard for Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, who is having to wait a little longer for a tranche of shares worth £150,000 that were due to arrive in June. “In light of the current environment”, which means an instruction to banks from the Bank of England to go easy on pay, he’ll collect the first 20% portion of his reward from a 2017-2019 incentive scheme in March next year instead. He’ll survive, especially as he collected his much larger annual bonus only last month. The interesting piece in the regulatory pay manoeuvres, however, is what happens in the new year when banks’ bonus season comes around again. Capital buffers will need rebuilding after absorbing losses from bad loans. Executives’ bonuses, by rights, should be slashed until the defences are restored. An instruction from Threadneedle Street to pay zero bonuses would make life interesting. It’s next year’s battle, but it’s coming.', 'charCount': '4157', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/nilspratley"">Nils Pratley</a>'}","[{'id': 'business/nils-pratley-on-finance', 'type': 'blog', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Nils Pratley on finance', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance', 'references': [], 'description': ""The Guardian's financial editor on the biggest issues in business ""}, {'id': 'business/jpmorgan', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'JP Morgan', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/jpmorgan', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/jpmorgan', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/banking', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Banking', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/banking', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/business', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Business', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/business', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/business', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/jamie-dimon', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Jamie Dimon', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/jamie-dimon', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/jamie-dimon', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/globalrecession', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Global recession', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/globalrecession', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/globalrecession', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/global-economy', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Global economy', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/global-economy', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/global-economy', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/economics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Economics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/stock-markets', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Stock markets', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/stock-markets', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/useconomy', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'US economy', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/useconomy', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/centrica', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Centrica', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/centrica', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/centrica', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/barclay', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Barclays', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/barclay', 'references': []}, {'id': 'business/executive-pay-bonuses', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'business', 'sectionName': 'Business', 'webTitle': 'Executive pay and bonuses', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/executive-pay-bonuses', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/business/executive-pay-bonuses', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/comment', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Comment', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/nilspratley', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Nils Pratley', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/nilspratley', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Nils Pratley is the Guardian\'s financial editor.

However, the figures show that in the year to March 2020, the number of self-inflicted deaths declined 8% to 80, while assaults were down 4% in the 12 months to December to 32,669 incidents. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “The government’s own figures, from before the coronavirus lockdown began, reveal the sheer scale of human misery behind bars across England and Wales. Assaults may be falling but the restricted regimes imposed have caused further surges in the numbers of self-injury incidents. “Since then prison regimes have tightened even further. But these figures show that keeping prisoners safe during the pandemic involves so much more than seeking to reduce rates of infection. “The need to reduce the prison population could not be clearer. It is intolerable that prisoners should be spending 23 hours or more each day locked in cells, either in overcrowded conditions or prolonged solitary confinement, with nothing to do.” Separate data from the MoJ revealed there were 3,367 prisoners held under the terms of the controversial imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence. The IPP sentence, scrapped in 2012, was a form of indeterminate sentence in which offenders were given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes. Those given an IPP sentence are placed on licence indefinitely after release, meaning they can be recalled to prison at any stage. The psychological impact of the IPP regime has been at the heart of numerous deaths in prisons in recent years. There were 2,039 unreleased IPP prisoners on 31 March 2020, a fall of 15% in a year, but the number of those recalled increased in the same period by 25% to 1,328. Meanwhile, the proportion of the IPP prisoner population who are past their minimum tariff continued to increase to 94% at 31 March compared with 91% at the same time the previous year. There were 9,995 assaults on prison staff in the 12 months to December 2019, a 2% decrease from the previous 12 months. In the same period, there were 3,813 serious assault incidents, a decrease of 3% from the previous 12 months. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), part of the human rights organisation the Council of Europe, published a damning report on visits to prisons in England last year. The watchdog found that prison officers were allegedly punching compliant inmates who they suspected might misbehave in the future, in a practice known as “preventive strikes”. More broadly, the committee said that despite some progress since its last inspection in 2016, the prison system in England was in “deep crisis”, finding the jails visited to be “violent, unsafe and overcrowded”. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which supports families of people who have died in custody, said: “People in prison are totally dependent on the state for their safety. These latest figures show around six people are dying in prison every week and that levels of self-harm have shattered previous record highs. This reflects a long-running failure in the government’s duty of care to protect lives in prison. “Regretfully we fear the worst is yet to come as the impact of the virus is felt throughout the prison estate. The frustration and despair of prisoners faced with prolonged isolation in appalling conditions must be closely monitored and addressed.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

<p>Take a <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxmu2rwsnhi9j9c/Draft-COVID-19-Model%20%2813%29.pdf?dl=0"">recent model</a> from Oxford University. It assessed how well different outbreak scenarios fitted the rise in coronavirus deaths in the UK and Italy. The most extreme UK scenario assumed that only a tiny fraction of people were at risk of serious illness. It also estimated that, as of last week, 68% of the population had been exposed to the virus. The study, which has not been published or peer-reviewed, unleashed a flurry of headlines declaring that coronavirus may have infected <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8148529/Coronavirus-infected-half-British-population-say-Oxford-University-experts.html"">half</a> of <a href=""https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1259854/coronavirus-uk-spread-boris-johnson-covid-19-death-toll-oxford-medical-researchers"">the</a> <a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-half-uk-population-oxford-university-study-finds-a4396721.html"">people</a> in <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b"">Britain</a>.

<p>Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the Oxford study set out a hypothesis and nothing more. “It’s like me sitting here and putting into very fancy equations what would change if we had a vaccine tomorrow.

<p>The model, based on 13-year-old code for a long-feared influenza pandemic, assumed that the demand for intensive care units would be the same for both infections.

<p>It is not a question of whether models are flawed but in which ways are they flawed, and models can still be enormously valuable if their shortcomings are appreciated. As with other sources of information, however, they should never be used alone.</p>

Witness the emerging evidence that Bashar al-Assad in Damascus and Xi Jinping in Beijing are allowing the disease to wreak havoc among those groups whom the rulers have deemed to be unpersons, their lives unworthy of basic protection. Assad is deliberately leaving Syrians in opposition-held areas more vulnerable to the pandemic, according to <a href=""https://www.csis.org/analysis/cross-border-aid-covid-19-and-us-decisions-syria"">Will Todman</a> of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As he puts it: “Covid-19 has provided Assad a new opportunity to instrumentalize suffering.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, China continues to hold 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps, where they contend now not only with inhuman conditions but also a coronavirus outbreak. Those camps are cramped, lack adequate sanitation and have poor medical facilities: the virus couldn’t ask for a better breeding ground. What’s more, Uighur Muslims are <a href=""https://uighurtimes.com/index.php/in-a-dangerous-move-china-forces-30000-uighur-workers-to-return-to-work-in-hotan/"">reportedly being forced to work as labourers</a>, filling in for non-Muslims who are allowed to stay home and protect themselves. That, according to one observer, “<a href=""https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2020/04/23/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-uighur-muslims-an-ignored-crisis/"">is reflective</a> of how the Republic of China views [Uighur Muslims] as nothing but disposable commodities”.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pandemic has allowed would-be dictators an excuse to seize yet more power. Enter Viktor Orbán of Hungary, whose response to coronavirus was immediate: he persuaded his pliant parliament to grant him the right to rule by decree. Orbán said he needed emergency powers to fight the dreaded disease, but there is no time limit on them; they will remain his even once the threat has passed. They include the power to jail those who “spread false information”. Naturally, that’s already led to a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-laws-prompt-new-showdown-with-brussels"">crackdown on individuals </a>guilty of nothing more than posting criticism of the government on Facebook. Orbán has long sought to rule Hungary as an autocrat, but the pandemic gave him his chance, allowing him to brand anyone standing in his way as unwilling to help the leader fight a mortal threat.</p> <p>Xi has not missed that same trick, using coronavirus to intensify his imposition of China’s Orwellian “social credit” system, whereby citizens are tracked, monitored and rated for their compliance. Now that system can include health and, thanks to the virus, much of the public ambivalence that previously existed towards it is likely to melt away. After all, runs the logic, good citizens are surely obliged to give up even more of their autonomy if it helps save lives.</p> <p>For many of the world’s strongmen, though, coronavirus doesn’t even need to be an excuse. Its chief value is the global distraction it has created, allowing unprincipled rulers to make mischief when natural critics at home and abroad are preoccupied with the urgent business of life and death.</p> <p>Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he’s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration’s steady and deliberate <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-environmental-blitzkrieg-coronavirus"">erosion of environmental protections</a>. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/trump-epa-obama-clean-car-rules-climate-change"">new cars</a>, frozen rules for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/14/trump-epa-soot-pollution-clean-air-standards"">soot air pollution</a>, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he’s also <a href=""https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-trumps-epa-halts-environmental-law-enorcement-during-coronavirus-pandemic"">relaxed</a> reporting rules for polluters.</p> <p>Trump’s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he’s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to “protect” the Amazon rainforest. I say “protect” because, as <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/deforestation-amazon-has-soared-under-cover-coronavirus-n1204451"">NBC News reported this week</a>, satellite imagery shows “deforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus”. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees – this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound.</p> <p>Another Trump admirer, India’s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/34ad9282-74d7-4a85-a629-a9655339c366"">crack down on Muslim citizens</a> and their leaders “indiscriminately”, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a “Muslim disease” and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a “corona jihad”.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu – who can claim to have been <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house"">Trumpist before Trump</a> – has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, <a href=""https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440"">the smart money suggests we should be cautious</a>: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, “demonstrating their weakness rather than strength” – that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin’s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus.</p> <p>Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world’s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness.</p> <p>• Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>', 'newspaperPageNumber': '1', 'wordcount': '1174', 'commentCloseDate': '2020-05-15T17:45:00Z', 'commentable': 'true', 'firstPublicationDate': '2020-05-15T16:10:02Z', 'isInappropriateForSponsorship': 'false', 'isPremoderated': 'false', 'lastModified': '2020-05-15T17:55:23Z', 'newspaperEditionDate': '2020-05-16T00:00:00Z', 'productionOffice': 'UK', 'publication': 'The Guardian', 'shortUrl': 'https://gu.com/p/dpgy6', 'shouldHideAdverts': 'false', 'showInRelatedContent': 'true', 'thumbnail': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d085dd5e48b1e4048a7e4d38256df245544c60ed/0_120_5568_3341/500.jpg', 'legallySensitive': 'false', 'lang': 'en', 'isLive': 'true', 'bodyText': 'Under the cover of coronavirus, all kinds of wickedness are happening.

Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he’s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration’s steady and deliberate erosion of environmental protections. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for new cars, frozen rules for soot air pollution, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he’s also relaxed reporting rules for polluters. Trump’s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he’s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to “protect” the Amazon rainforest. I say “protect” because, as NBC News reported this week, satellite imagery shows “deforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus”. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees – this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound. Another Trump admirer, India’s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to crack down on Muslim citizens and their leaders “indiscriminately”, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a “Muslim disease” and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a “corona jihad”. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu – who can claim to have been Trumpist before Trump – has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, the smart money suggests we should be cautious: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news. Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, “demonstrating their weakness rather than strength” – that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin’s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus. Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world’s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist', 'charCount': '7165', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/jonathanfreedland"">Jonathan Freedland</a>'}","[{'id': 'commentisfree/commentisfree', 'type': 'blog', 'sectionId': 'commentisfree', 'sectionName': 'Opinion', 'webTitle': 'Opinion', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/bashar-al-assad', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Bashar al-Assad', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/bashar-al-assad', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/syria', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Syria', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/syria', 'references': [], 'description': 'Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

Some 3 million people in total were in households where someone had been forced to skip some meals. More than 1 million people reported losing all their income because of the pandemic, with over a third of them believing they would not be entitled to any government help.</p> <p>The foundation’s findings are based on a YouGov poll carried out across England, Scotland and Wales this week. Its director, Anna Taylor, said the crisis was too big to be left to food banks and local authorities without funding. “This needs urgent and substantial investment from central government which needs to put money directly into the pockets of families who can’t afford food.”</p> <p>Charities running food banks are also struggling to cope with a huge rise in people coming to them for emergency parcels. Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, said she feared the government was being too slow to respond and the situation was “spiralling out of control”.

Just three weeks into the lockdown, the Food Foundation said that 1.5 million Britons reported not eating for a whole day because they had no money or access to food. Some 3 million people in total were in households where someone had been forced to skip some meals. More than 1 million people reported losing all their income because of the pandemic, with over a third of them believing they would not be entitled to any government help. The foundation’s findings are based on a YouGov poll carried out across England, Scotland and Wales this week. Its director, Anna Taylor, said the crisis was too big to be left to food banks and local authorities without funding. “This needs urgent and substantial investment from central government which needs to put money directly into the pockets of families who can’t afford food.” Charities running food banks are also struggling to cope with a huge rise in people coming to them for emergency parcels. Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, said she feared the government was being too slow to respond and the situation was “spiralling out of control”. She said: “Food banks in our network are seeing as much as a 300% increase in footfall compared to this time last year but are still struggling to source enough appropriate food.” Local authorities told the Guardian that the Food Foundation findings reflected what they are seeing on the ground. In Liverpool, for example, there has been a 150% increase in emergency grants from the council to people who have no food or money for electricity since the lockdown. The city has a highly developed network of food banks and food distribution charities which have increased their operations rapidly in the last few weeks. FareShare, the nationwide distributor of surplus food, is now open longer hours in Liverpool – from 7am to 10pm – and has distributed £380,000 worth of goods to families in need in the last five days. Football fans supporting food banks have also raised £150,000 to buy more stock but the city’s assistant mayor, Jane Corbett, said families were being hit by “the double whammy of austerity and Covid-19” and charity was not enough on its own. She warned that the local authority could not pay for the impact of the pandemic without funding from government. “The fragility of our current social security system is now being seen in stark relief; extreme pressure on food banks is just one clear example. Our budget has been cut by 63% since 2013.” The numbers reporting going hungry in the last three weeks are 1.5 to two times higher than those experiencing hunger over a whole year in recent times, according to Dr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London. “They suggest the Covid-19 lockdown has had a swift and devastating impact on the population’s ability to access sufficient food, both for economic reasons and because of self-isolation,” she said. YouGov polled 4,343 adults from 7-9 April and weighted its figures to represent all British adults. A government spokesperson said: “Public safety and making sure that those most at risk from the virus get the support they need is our top priority. People should stay at home, to help protect our NHS and save lives. “We’re working with the groceries industry, local government, local resilience and emergency partners to ensure essential items are delivered as soon as possible to the most vulnerable.”', 'charCount': '3594', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/felicitylawrence"">Felicity Lawrence</a>'}","[{'id': 'society/food-banks', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Food banks', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/food-banks', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/society', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Society', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/society', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/society', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/charities', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Charities', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/charities', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/charities', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/voluntarysector', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Voluntary sector', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/voluntarysector', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/voluntarysector', 'references': []}, {'id': 'society/localgovernment', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Local government', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/localgovernment', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/politics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics', 'references': [], 'description': '<p><br></p>'}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/welfare', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Welfare', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/welfare', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/callout', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'Callout', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/callout', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/callout', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/felicitylawrence', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Felicity Lawrence', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/felicitylawrence', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/felicitylawrence', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian.

US braces for big coronavirus rise, while China reports no new domestic cases Donald Trump has approved legislation introduced by House Democrats to deploy $100bn of coronavirus aid in the form of free testing, expanded Medicaid and unemployment benefits, paid sick leave and childcare leave for certain employees.

And in London, dozens of tube stations are being closed as the city – at the centre of the UK’s outbreak – prepares for the likelihood of a full lockdown. Economies are facing a collapse unlike anything in modern times, including the Great Depression, and the response must be big, bold and coordinated, writes Larry Elliott. “Sadly, the world has rarely looked less prepared to act in concert and that matters, because this time it is not the banks that need bailing out, it is the people.” Funeral services are struggling to keep up with the surge of deaths in Italy’s hardest-hit province, while the country’s authorities say they have charged more than 40,000 people for violating the lockdown imposed to contain the virus. A glimmer of good news, though, from Vò, the small town where Italy’s first Covid-19 death occurred – and where mass testing has halted its spread. China, where the outbreak began, reported no new domestic transmissions of the virus for the first time on Wednesday. There were 34 new cases in the country, but all were recent arrivals from overseas.

US braces for big coronavirus rise, while China reports no new domestic cases Donald Trump has approved legislation introduced by House Democrats to deploy $100bn of coronavirus aid in the form of free testing, expanded Medicaid and unemployment benefits, paid sick leave and childcare leave for certain employees. Businesses and workers across the US are wondering what’s next as custom dries up and layoffs rise precipitously. The president also announced on Wednesday that the US-Canadian border would be closed to “all non-essential traffic”. Australia and New Zealand are both closing their borders to non-residents. And in London, dozens of tube stations are being closed as the city – at the centre of the UK’s outbreak – prepares for the likelihood of a full lockdown. Economies are facing a collapse unlike anything in modern times, including the Great Depression, and the response must be big, bold and coordinated, writes Larry Elliott. “Sadly, the world has rarely looked less prepared to act in concert and that matters, because this time it is not the banks that need bailing out, it is the people.” Funeral services are struggling to keep up with the surge of deaths in Italy’s hardest-hit province, while the country’s authorities say they have charged more than 40,000 people for violating the lockdown imposed to contain the virus. A glimmer of good news, though, from Vò, the small town where Italy’s first Covid-19 death occurred – and where mass testing has halted its spread. China, where the outbreak began, reported no new domestic transmissions of the virus for the first time on Wednesday. There were 34 new cases in the country, but all were recent arrivals from overseas. As other nations struggle to respond to the pandemic, writes Lily Kuo, Beijing is positioning itself as a global benefactor, sending them testing kits, ventilators, masks and medics. Immigration courts. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has said it will scale back its aggressive operations amid the coronavirus outbreak, but the administration has so far kept most of its immigration courts open, despite the risks. Google testing. Trump has hyped a Google-affiliated program allowing people to schedule coronavirus tests online, but two pilot testing sites in California saw little activity on Tuesday. Tech execs. Many tech workers are perfectly capable of working from home. But some of their “disruptive” leaders are choosing to buck conventional wisdom, even in a crisis. Brand Ivanka. Ivanka Trump is facing widespread criticism after tweeting uplifting ideas for family quarantine. Not even a pandemic can stop her building her personal brand, writes Arwa Mahdawi. And in other news… With three weeks to the next Democratic primary and after another thumping from Joe Biden in Tuesday’s contests, Bernie Sanders is once again reassessing the future of a presidential campaign that many consider increasingly untenable. The five biggest airlines in the US, which are currently arguing collectively for a $50m government bailout, have handed out more than $45bn to shareholders and executives in share buybacks and other giveaways over the last five years. Last year’s unprecedentedly hot Arctic summer led to the loss of 600m tons of Greenland ice – enough to raise global sea levels by 2.2mm in just two months, according to research. Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell is suing the late, disgraced financier’s estate to recoup legal fees for her defence against accusations that she helped recruit young women for his alleged sex-trafficking scheme. The Spanish government has admitted it is still paying bonuses to 115 police officers who were awarded medals under the Franco regime, more than four decades after the dictator’s death. English-born, Norwegian-raised dog musher Thomas Waerner has won the Iditarod Trail sled dog race across Alaska, one of the few US sporting events to have gone ahead despite the coronavirus. Waerner and his 10 dogs completed the 1,000-mile route in nine days, 10 hours, 37 minutes and 47 seconds.

In a letter to Alok Sharma, the business secretary, O’Grady said unions would have “no hesitation” in telling their members that the guidelines cannot protect workers unless they were significantly strengthened – a move that could lead to many refusing requests to get back to work. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says: “Working people need to see that the government is genuinely committed to protecting their health and safety. At present, this guidance fails to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly and is an open goal to the worst of employers who want to return to business at usual – which will put their workforce at risk … “We want to be able to recommend the government’s approach to safe working to our members and the wider workforce. As it stands, we cannot.” Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said on Monday employees could return to work with physical shields to separate them from colleagues, personal protective equipment (PPE) and limits on time spent close to each other. He said there was a range of measures that could be used in workplaces where maintaining a two-metre distance between colleagues was not possible. Wallace told the BBC that supermarket shoppers were not two metres away from those working at the tills but were instead separated by physical shields. “Potentially, shields or PPE is a way forward,” he said. Wallace also highlighted the “use of time” as another tool: “You could be closer than two metres but not for long,” he said. According to sources who have seen the guidelines, other workplace measures include reduced hot-desking and staggered shift times. The document urges employers to minimise the number of staff using equipment and maximise home working. However, a section marked PPE contains only a promise that more detail would follow. It also does not go into detail about how pregnant women, older workers and other vulnerable groups should be treated, and appears to leave many decisions up to employers about what they consider safe. For example, one section says employers could consider limiting how many people are in a vehicle, without saying how many the government considers would be safe. In her letter to Sharma, O’Grady \ufeffsaid the government appeared to have “entirely disregarded” TUC suggestions about how a safer system of working could operate in practice. “This has left me with no choice but to write to you directly to ask that you make immediate and substantial changes to your approach,” she said. “The consultation papers suggest government proposes a return to business as usual, with no new requirements placed on employers beyond existing health and safety law, and no government commitment to increased health and safety enforcement or public awareness of their health and safety rights. “We believe this approach will risk the safety and wellbeing of workers as they return to work. If the guidance is not significantly strengthened, safe working will not be guaranteed, and unions will have no hesitation in saying so publicly and to our members.” She said some of the proposed guidance was in some cases weaker than existing legislation and listed the TUC’s most pressing concerns: The non-binding nature of the guidance, which repeatedly suggests that “employers should consider” actions such as enabling physical distancing or providing hand washing facilities. “We believe that this leaves far too much to employer discretion,” she said The lack of recommendations on PPE The failure to require employers to publish their risk assessments, nor to agree them with recognised unions An absence of reference to enforcement mechanisms such as the Health and Safety Executive’s existing powers to issue prohibition notices, and to workers’ existing rights to refuse to work in situations which present a serious and imminent danger to them A lack of specific guidelines for those in vulnerable groups, for example, pregnant women, which appears to suggest that they can be expected to work in unsafe environments, in violation of their existing rights under health and safety law. Other concerns include the lack of detail on how workers can be expected to travel safely to work, how parents without childcare can be expected to work while nurseries and other settings are closed, and the rights of those who care for someone who is shielding and on future access to the job retention scheme.', 'charCount': '6221', 'shouldHideReaderRevenue': 'false', 'showAffiliateLinks': 'false', 'bylineHtml': '<a href=""profile/rowena-mason"">Rowena Mason</a> Deputy political editor'}","[{'id': 'politics/tuc', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'TUC', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/tuc', 'references': []}, {'id': 'world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'world', 'sectionName': 'World news', 'webTitle': 'Coronavirus outbreak', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak', 'references': []}, {'id': 'uk/uk', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'uk-news', 'sectionName': 'UK news', 'webTitle': 'UK news', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/politics', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Politics', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics', 'references': [], 'description': '<p><br></p>'}, {'id': 'society/health', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'society', 'sectionName': 'Society', 'webTitle': 'Health', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/health', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/society/health', 'references': []}, {'id': 'politics/tradeunions', 'type': 'keyword', 'sectionId': 'politics', 'sectionName': 'Politics', 'webTitle': 'Trade unions', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/tradeunions', 'references': []}, {'id': 'type/article', 'type': 'type', 'webTitle': 'Article', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/articles', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article', 'references': []}, {'id': 'tone/news', 'type': 'tone', 'webTitle': 'News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news', 'references': []}, {'id': 'profile/rowena-mason', 'type': 'contributor', 'webTitle': 'Rowena Mason', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/rowena-mason', 'references': [], 'bio': '<p>Rowena Mason is deputy political editor&nbsp;for the Guardian</p>', 'bylineImageUrl': 'https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899384228/Rowena-Mason.jpg', 'bylineLargeImageUrl': 'https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Rowena-Mason,-L.png', 'firstName': 'mason', 'lastName': 'rowena'}, {'id': 'tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news', 'type': 'tracking', 'webTitle': 'UK Home News', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news', 'references': []}]",False,pillar/news,News,"Coronavirus plan for returning to work puts employees at risk, says TUC","<p>Exclusive: draft guidelines ‘vague, non-binding and can’t be supported in current form’</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest"">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak"">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul>","Exclusive: draft guidelines ‘vague, non-binding and can’t be supported in current form’",Rowena Mason Deputy political editor,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5bdfdfab4fdaa0b905d7201c1b0db0bc667be161"">

    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus"">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>
    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge"">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>
    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk"">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>
    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>
    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one"">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>

The court will not be seduced into treating that as an insignificant consideration.”</p> <p>He argued that Packham and others had already had plenty of opportunity to make arguments about HS2’s environmental impact while the railway was scrutinised by both chambers of parliament, which passed the act enabling HS2 in 2017.</p> <p>Packham, who crowdfunded £100,000 for the challenge, said: “I’m immensely disappointed on behalf of all the wildlife that will now be destroyed in the next few weeks and the irreversible damage to the woodlands. These trees are going to come crashing to the ground and all the birds nesting in them and bats roosting in them are going to die and nobody is going to know anything about it.</p> <p>“Our nation will be robbed of some of our greatest national natural treasures over the next few days for an entirely fallacious vanity project.”</p> <p>During the hearing, David Wolf QC, for Packham, argued that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was not given all the information required to make an informed decision on HS2 by the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2"">Oakervee </a><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2"">review</a>, which was led by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee.</p> <p>He told the courts the works would cause “irretrievable and irreversible” harm to ancient woodlands. HS2 Ltd contractors are clearing trees and soil from five ancient woodlands in Warwickshire during April, despite <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/01/betrayal-of-trust-hs2-criticised-over-removal-woodland-soils"">the Woodland Trust condemning the timing</a> and the RSPB warning that bird nests would almost certainly be destroyed.</p> <p>HS2 has said temporary exclusion zones are being put around all nests discovered by its ecologists until the chicks are fledged, and contractors were “keenly aware of the law around nesting birds”.</p> <p>Wolf told the court that Oakervee’s review failed to properly consider HS2’s environmental impact or the railway being a net contributor to carbon emissions during construction. Wolf said the emissions produced by all the concrete required during construction would cause emissions of 8-14m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which would contravene Britain’s legal obligations to reduce its emissions under the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>He argued that hearing the review would not unduly delay HS2 because if it was to abide by the law its contractors would not be able to continue with the clearance of ancient woodland. “This woodland will now already be full of nesting birds and it is a criminal offence to interfere with those nesting birds. Their ability to proceed in this [nesting season] period is already heavily compromised,” he told the court.</p> <p>Dr Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, which provided an expert witness statement criticising HS2’s “translocation” of ancient woodland soils during April, said: “To say we are disappointed by this outcome is an understatement. This decision is catastrophic for these irreplaceable ancient woodlands and the hundreds of species that call them home. Instead if bursting into life they will now be destroyed. </p> <p>“The flawed and invariably unsuccessful process of translocation will be carried out at completely the wrong time of year, flying in the face of professional standards and HS2’s original assurance that they’d do it when they should – when everything is dormant.

HS2’s felling of woodlands in spring when birds are nesting has been widely condemned by wildlife charities but the conservationist Chris Packham’s attempt to halt “enabling” works was rejected after the court decided there was “no real prospect of success” for a judicial review. Two high court judges made the ruling after a one-day hearing held over video link, as bailiffs sought to evict protesters occupying treehouses in Crackley Wood, Warwickshire. The hearing heard that it would cost £20m–£25m to “press the pause button” on HS2 while a full judicial review of the government’s backing for the £106bn high-speed project could be considered. Timothy Mould QC, for the secretary of state for transport, said that cost would “come from the public purse. The court will not be seduced into treating that as an insignificant consideration.” He argued that Packham and others had already had plenty of opportunity to make arguments about HS2’s environmental impact while the railway was scrutinised by both chambers of parliament, which passed the act enabling HS2 in 2017. Packham, who crowdfunded £100,000 for the challenge, said: “I’m immensely disappointed on behalf of all the wildlife that will now be destroyed in the next few weeks and the irreversible damage to the woodlands. These trees are going to come crashing to the ground and all the birds nesting in them and bats roosting in them are going to die and nobody is going to know anything about it. “Our nation will be robbed of some of our greatest national natural treasures over the next few days for an entirely fallacious vanity project.” During the hearing, David Wolf QC, for Packham, argued that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was not given all the information required to make an informed decision on HS2 by the Oakervee review, which was led by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee. He told the courts the works would cause “irretrievable and irreversible” harm to ancient woodlands. HS2 Ltd contractors are clearing trees and soil from five ancient woodlands in Warwickshire during April, despite the Woodland Trust condemning the timing and the RSPB warning that bird nests would almost certainly be destroyed. HS2 has said temporary exclusion zones are being put around all nests discovered by its ecologists until the chicks are fledged, and contractors were “keenly aware of the law around nesting birds”. Wolf told the court that Oakervee’s review failed to properly consider HS2’s environmental impact or the railway being a net contributor to carbon emissions during construction. Wolf said the emissions produced by all the concrete required during construction would cause emissions of 8-14m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which would contravene Britain’s legal obligations to reduce its emissions under the Paris climate agreement. He argued that hearing the review would not unduly delay HS2 because if it was to abide by the law its contractors would not be able to continue with the clearance of ancient woodland. “This woodland will now already be full of nesting birds and it is a criminal offence to interfere with those nesting birds. Their ability to proceed in this [nesting season] period is already heavily compromised,” he told the court. Dr Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, which provided an expert witness statement criticising HS2’s “translocation” of ancient woodland soils during April, said: “To say we are disappointed by this outcome is an understatement. This decision is catastrophic for these irreplaceable ancient woodlands and the hundreds of species that call them home. Instead if bursting into life they will now be destroyed. “The flawed and invariably unsuccessful process of translocation will be carried out at completely the wrong time of year, flying in the face of professional standards and HS2’s original assurance that they’d do it when they should – when everything is dormant. Nature and the environment are the big losers today.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We are pleased with today’s verdict. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country.

He is in extremely good spirits.” Johnson was transferred to an intensive care unit on Monday. Global death toll passes 94,000; US overtakes Spain’s total casualties The global death toll has passed 94,000 on the Johns Hopkins University tracker – the current figure is 94,807. The US has now overtaken Spain with more than 16,000 deaths. Spain has 15,238, according to the Maryland-based university’s research. Italy is the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths at 19,279. Trump says new coronavirus treatment ‘will be tested soon’ Donald Trump said Pfizer had found a “promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating” and it hoped to begin testing in clinical trials “very soon”. In a press conference, the US president added that through the FDA’s coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, 19 therapies and treatments were being tested and 26 more were “in the active planning for clinical trials”. However, there has been scepticism over Trump’s earlier claims for possible treatments including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. South Africa extends lockdown by a further fortnight South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced it will extend its coronavirus lockdown by a further two weeks. He had imposed a 21-day total lockdown on the country’s 56 million inhabitants on 27 March, enforced by the police and the army. On Thursday, Ramaphosa said: “This evening, I stand before you to ask you to endure even longer. I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis and so that tens of thousands of lives may be saved.” France’s death toll rises to more than 12,000 The country has said the total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 12,210, from 10,869 on Wednesday, with care homes accounting for more than a third of all fatalities. The number of people in intensive care has fallen slightly for the first time since the start of the outbreak. Jérôme Salomon, head of the public health authority, said there were now 7,062 people in intensive care at hospitals, a net decrease of 82 from a day earlier. US economy ‘could reopen in May’ The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the American economy could start to reopen for business in May despite experts’ emphasis on prolonged physical distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Asked on CNBC whether he thought Donald Trump could reopen the economy so soon, Mnuchin said: “I do.” “As soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues, we are making everything necessary that American companies and American workers can be open for business.” Australian minister fined for breaching lockdown rules The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state’s strict public health orders. It emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he did not break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home before the state lockdown came into effect. Eurozone countries strike deal on coronavirus rescue Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement on an emergency rescue package aimed at responding to the economic adversity triggered by coronavirus. Finance ministers from countries including the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and France clapped over their teleconference. “We acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month,” Mário Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister and president of the group, told his counterparts. The package includes a boost to the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new unemployment insurance scheme proposed by the European commission. WHO had warned about risk of Covid-19 in January The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection. Technical guidance notes seen by the Guardian and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks. Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying “there was no human-to-human transmission”. Pope holds Holy Thursday mass in empty St Peter’s Basilica Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter’s Basilica. He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir. The pope said: “These days more than 60 [priests] have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals.

In it he told trusts: “In recent days, new Covid-19 infections have been diagnosed in intensive care units in a number of European countries, without any epidemiologial links to high risk areas.</p> \n<p>“Nosocomial [hospital-acquired] transmission has occurred in these units affecting other patients and staff.

Eight of the new patients announced on Tuesday had recently travelled from Italy. The latest cases also included the first person to have travelled from Germany, while the others had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, which suggests that the virus was not contracted in the UK.</p> \n<p>Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife.</p> \n<aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/school-pupils-could-be-sent-elsewhere-under-uk-coronavirus-plans"">School pupils could be sent elsewhere under UK coronavirus plans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The 12 new UK cases constituted the second highest single-day increase in cases.

NHS bosses have ramped up their efforts to detect the virus by ordering all 135 acute hospital trusts in England to routinely test anyone in intensive care units (ICUs) who has a breathing problem. They are worried that people who are already very sick in hospital with different illnesses could be infected with the virus by a fellow patient. The plan is a direct response to the detection of Covid-19 in patients in intensive care units in Europe whose illness cannot be traced to any of the areas where the virus is circulating, such as northern Italy. Staff working in these units have also contracted the virus. The move came to light in a letter sent to all NHS organisations on Tuesday by Prof Keith Willett, the senior doctor co-ordinating NHS England’s efforts against the virus. In it he told trusts: “In recent days, new Covid-19 infections have been diagnosed in intensive care units in a number of European countries, without any epidemiologial links to high risk areas. “Nosocomial [hospital-acquired] transmission has occurred in these units affecting other patients and staff. It is essential that we detect cases admitted to intensive care at the earliest opportunity. We are requesting that all intensive care units and severe respiratory (Ecmo) centres commence case detection.” Adult and paediatric ICUs should test any patient whose “presenting condition is an acute community acquired respiratory infection of any kind, regardless of known or suspected causative pathogen and clinical features”, the nine-page letter said. Willett’s letter also reveals that NHS England has declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a level four incident, which is the the highest level of threat to the functioning of the health service. It previously designated Brexit and the damaging Wanna Cry attack on NHS IT systems in 2017 as level four incidents. The move emerged as the government announced that 12 more people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infected people to 51. Eight of the new patients announced on Tuesday had recently travelled from Italy. The latest cases also included the first person to have travelled from Germany, while the others had been to Singapore, Japan and Iran, which suggests that the virus was not contracted in the UK. Health officials in the Canary Islands reported the first case of a British national testing positive at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife. The 12 new UK cases constituted the second highest single-day increase in cases. They include the first known cases in Hampshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire. Others are from London, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Kent. Dr Will Welfare, of Public Health England North West, said there were three new Covid-19 cases in Greater Manchester, including two from Bury. “As a result of contact tracing we know the new Bury cases announced today are known contacts of the previously confirmed case from Bury,” he said. “The third case is a resident of Bolton which is not linked to the two cases in Bury announced today. The Bolton resident became infected while in Italy.” Meanwhile, millions of patients could have their NHS care postponed if an epidemic forces hospitals to cancel planned operations and outpatient clinics to free beds and doctors to focus on people with coronavirus. “If the virus escalates in scale, the impact on an NHS that is already under intense strain, with record numbers of patients on waiting lists, people routinely being treated in hospital corridors and others waiting weeks for a GP appointment, will be grave,” said Dr Helena McKeown, a chief officer at the British Medical Association.

Not that most bouncy and irrepressible of men, who always seemed the definition of a lucky general. While we know this virus does not discriminate, there is still something faintly surreal about the idea of the prime minister lying in intensive care, his own body now a battlefield for the virus that has come to define his fledgling premiership.</p> <p>Don’t underestimate how many ordinary people will be shaken by the sight of a 55-year-old laid low like this, despite the best care the NHS has to offer. So many lives have already been touched by this virus in ways we could never have imagined three months ago and now, by a terrible irony, the man responsible for leading us through it is one of them.</p> <p>Whose heart does not go out out to a heavily pregnant <a href=""https://uk.news.yahoo.com/queen-sends-boris-johnson-carrie-symonds-message-coronavirus-134749783.html"">Carrie Symonds</a>, weeks away from giving birth to their baby? The wider Johnson family, too, deserve to feel supported in their distress, like any other family waiting for news from hospital. Yet beyond this private and very understandable distress lies a grave new political reality. Just as the epidemic nears its dangerous peak, a hole is emerging at the heart of government.</p> <p>It no longer feels like a coincidence that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/05/queen-addresses-the-uk-over-coronavirus-crisis-watch-in-full"">the Queen</a> was finally deployed on Sunday night, just as Johnson was heading for hospital. Her address to the nation was a gentle reminder that in Britain power does not rest solely in one place, yet in practice there is only so much she can do to steady a ship now heading for constitutionally uncharted waters.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/dominic-raab-is-boris-johnson-nominated-stand-in-coronavirus"">Dominic Raab</a>, the foreign secretary, has been asked to deputise for Johnson, yet that official language conceals a very grey area. Unlike America, Britain has no designated survivor to step up in an emergency. Constitutionally speaking, there is no such thing as an acting prime minister either; there are only prime ministers, who serve until they lose an election, resign or die, and in their absence power devolves to the cabinet as a whole.</p> <p>Raab’s new status is essentially a means of preventing the chain of command from becoming confused or mired in internecine cabinet rivalries, although it remains to be seen whether he really has the authority to knock his colleagues’ heads together.

Not Boris Johnson, surely. Not that most bouncy and irrepressible of men, who always seemed the definition of a lucky general. While we know this virus does not discriminate, there is still something faintly surreal about the idea of the prime minister lying in intensive care, his own body now a battlefield for the virus that has come to define his fledgling premiership. Don’t underestimate how many ordinary people will be shaken by the sight of a 55-year-old laid low like this, despite the best care the NHS has to offer. So many lives have already been touched by this virus in ways we could never have imagined three months ago and now, by a terrible irony, the man responsible for leading us through it is one of them. Whose heart does not go out out to a heavily pregnant Carrie Symonds, weeks away from giving birth to their baby? The wider Johnson family, too, deserve to feel supported in their distress, like any other family waiting for news from hospital. Yet beyond this private and very understandable distress lies a grave new political reality. Just as the epidemic nears its dangerous peak, a hole is emerging at the heart of government. It no longer feels like a coincidence that the Queen was finally deployed on Sunday night, just as Johnson was heading for hospital. Her address to the nation was a gentle reminder that in Britain power does not rest solely in one place, yet in practice there is only so much she can do to steady a ship now heading for constitutionally uncharted waters. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has been asked to deputise for Johnson, yet that official language conceals a very grey area. Unlike America, Britain has no designated survivor to step up in an emergency. Constitutionally speaking, there is no such thing as an acting prime minister either; there are only prime ministers, who serve until they lose an election, resign or die, and in their absence power devolves to the cabinet as a whole. Raab’s new status is essentially a means of preventing the chain of command from becoming confused or mired in internecine cabinet rivalries, although it remains to be seen whether he really has the authority to knock his colleagues’ heads together. (Those who wonder why it’s him in charge rather than the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, now self-isolating after a family member showed coronavirus symptoms, perhaps miss the point that Johnson was nominating not a successor but a caretaker.) For now, the opposition seems willing to give all this the benefit of the doubt. Illness transforms the prime minister in the public mind, to the extent that it would seem grotesque for Labour to use this moment for political advantage. Nor can Keir Starmer do anything that might be interpreted as pressuring a sick man back to work; we’ll never know whether Johnson would have got this ill if he’d rested the minute he was diagnosed, but a culture in which politicians don’t feel able to take sick leave even on their hospital beds is in no sense a healthy one. Yet it remains the opposition’s job to hold government accountable for management of this epidemic, and if Johnson’s absence turns out to be prolonged, questions will eventually have to be asked about the democratic basis on which his chosen substitutes continue to govern. The cruelty of this situation is that it pits the human imperative to be kind, to make allowances for awful circumstances, against the remorseless political imperatives of a crisis in which many more lives are at stake. For there are life-changing judgment calls to be made over the coming weeks, as Downing Street grapples not only with clinical questions about when and how to lift the lockdown, but with an economic crisis unfolding alongside it at pace. It no longer seems credible that we will simply pick up where we left off pre-virus, and huge decisions loom about how to restart a hollowed-out economy and how the bills now being racked up will be repaid.

The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.</p> 
<p>Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more “noisy” and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.</p> 
<h2><strong>How sure are we about regional differences?</strong></h2> 
<p>Almost all available data and models suggest there are strong regional differences in terms of the number of infections and current transmission rates. Serology surveys suggest that more than 10% of people in London have been infected with Covid-19, compared with around 4% in the rest of the country. In general, urban centres have had more infections than rural areas.</p> 
<p>The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.</p>

<p>This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions.

<p>Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHE/Cambridge estimate for London as “extremely low”. His own team’s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.</p> 
<p>“This still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic … The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,” he said.</p> 
<h2><strong>What are the reasons for regional differences?</strong></h2> 
<p>Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.</p>

<p>There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.</p> 
<p>“If it turns out that there’s loads of immunity in the community, then that’s brilliant, but I don’t think we should plan for that scenario,” said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. “We don’t really know yet.”</p> 
<p>There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control.

<p>Differences in living arrangements – for instance, larger family groups living together outside London – could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.</p> 
<h2>Is there evidence that people in some regions have complied less with the lockdown?</h2> 
<p>There isn’t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.</p> 
<p>“The uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. “I thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.”</p> 
<h2>Do the models suggest restrictions should be eased regionally?</h2> 
<p>This is an emerging view among scientists. “Based on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,” said House. “There’s no point locking down if there’s no cases to prevent.” However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.</p> 
<p>“It’s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,” said Riley. “I suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.”</p>

</figure>",1400,,2020-05-15T16:53:22Z,false,false,2020-05-15T19:08:49Z,UK,The Guardian,https://gu.com/p/dpg65,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/5fb1f369324e73dd91184b40aa1d99bf50fd3904/0_94_3187_1912/500.jpg,false,en,true,"Transmission rates of Covid-19 remain dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave, even before the easing of some restrictions this week, as the focus shifts to transmission rates in the north of England. The latest official estimate places the national R value – the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: “We have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below 1.” The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago. A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes. The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing. It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply. Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time. There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as “frankly, madness”. The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to “stay at home” would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough. How do models calculate the R value? The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially; below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there. Some models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off. Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are. Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics.

Surely one thing that the government could do before getting to the point of closing schools – with the negative knock-on effects of parents having to take time of work etc – would be to make arrangements for schools to have plentiful supplies of free alcohol-based hand sanitiser, soap, tissues and other cleaning products. Austerity has seen schools openly begging parents for essential supplies such as toilet tissues, pens and writing paper. If the government funded these supplies, schools would be the ideal places to teach hand-washing and protocols for coughs and sneezes. This would be a great boost to containment and help prevent the spread of not just the coronavirus but many other common viruses and bacteria. Dr James D Williams Senior lecturer in education, University of Sussex • We are advised to wash our hands regularly, not to touch our faces, and to cough or sneeze into our elbows, our hands or a paper tissue.

While we do not yet know how long the virus can survive out of the body, I am unclear as to how effective sneezing into a clothed elbow will be other than as a good breeding place for the virus. If we are to cough into a tissue and then discard it, where should that be? I would expect large numbers of potentially contaminated tissues to join the discarded coffee cups and other waste food containers that litter our streets or, perhaps, placed in overflowing waste bins in our cities. It must be possible for our medical leaders to come up with better ways of controlling the spread of this virus. Dr Michael Robert Martin Retired GP, Devon • The picture on your front cover (4 March), of a man hanging on to a rail in a train carriage with his whole arm, is the reason why I consider the advice to sneeze into the crook of your elbow to be actively harmful.

Hundreds of vulnerable British citizens are stranded in Pakistan with many of them running short of the vital medication they need to treat serious health conditions. Accounts also emerged from Nepal, where hundreds of British tourists are stuck, some high up in the mountains with no way of getting back to the towns and home. British nationals have complained of receiving little to no consular support and say there is a lack of clear advice from the Foreign Office. The cost of commercial flights has skyrocketed. Among the British people stranded in Lahore, Pakistan, is 60-year-old Tanweer Ahmed Khan from Manchester, alongside six members of his family. Khan’s daughter, Ikra Naser, said her party, aged four to 65, had been due to fly back to the UK on Friday after visiting a sick relative but they had been stranded. Naser said: “My father has a severe heart condition and severe arthritis. He took enough medication to last until Monday but then we don’t know what he’ll do. My mum also suffers health conditions and she must travel with my dad to look after him, given how strong his meds are.” The outward flights cost £500 each for a return but the family is facing paying up to £2,000 for a single trip back – if they can even find one to take. Khan said she had spent many hours contacting the FCO. “But they don’t seem to care. I’m scared for my parents.” Another Briton, Adnan Aftab from Birmingham, said he was with his mother who had underlying health issues. Aftab said: “The medication she takes weakens her immune system. She only has limited medication with her and soon will be completely out. We have already forked out £1,000 [on flights that were subsequently cancelled] and so don’t have anything left.” Sahiba Sajid, an NHS hospital social worker from Leeds who is stranded in Pakistan, said: “I’m frustrated that I’m not able to return. The team I work in was already under a lot of pressure before I went abroad and I can only imagine how they are managing. I just want to go back and work but I’m stuck here instead.” Afzal Khan, the MP for Manchester Gorton, said a significant number of British nationals were stuck in Pakistan. Khan said: “I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are growing increasingly anxious about being unable to return home to the UK.

The standards required are those which will provide for essential needs, good health, satisfactory standards of child development, social cohesion and human dignity. To date, all governments stumble about in the dark. They even set levels of minimum incomes without the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/08/vicar-dibley-paul-nicolson-council-tax-refusing-benefit-cuts-jail-prison"">Refusenik rev: the vicar \u200bwhose council tax protest could put him in jail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a consequence, poor women have low birthweight babies with high morbidity and mortality rates throughout life. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers die, on average, five years younger. The poor experience double the rate of divorce and a higher rate of suicide among young people. Children who grow up in low-income families are more likely to leave school early after a lower attendance and achievement record and to have more contact with the police.</p> <p>Poverty-related crime, ill health and other expensive consequences of poverty may cost the treasury more than ensuring people have adequate incomes. Lord Morris of Manchester’s amendment to the welfare reform and pensions bill this week will address these issues.<br><strong>Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Zacchaeus 2000 Trust</em></p> <h2><strong>9 March 2000: The education we deserve</strong></h2> <p>Nick Davies concludes “there is almost no connection between reality and the easy consensus of distant journalists and politicians” when comparing Roedean and Stanley Deacon schools. This political malaise affects education, health and crime. We help people prepare their means statements for the magistrates. The reality is that poverty is so bad that decent people are propelled into crime, die young, give birth to underweight children, fall ill through stress and inadequate diet, despair of clothing their children adequately for school and have unmanageable debts.</p> <p>The easy consensus fails to take the government to task for grossly underestimating the depth of poverty which has built up. The hole in the middle of the polo mint policies of the “third way” awaits a diagnosis which admits to the reality, expense and social dangers of the extreme poverty of millions of adults in and out of work in Britain.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson<br></strong><em>Zacchaeus 2000 Trust</em></p> <h2><strong>13 May 2002: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/may/13/guardianletters"">New views on an age-old question</a></strong></h2> <p>It is not sufficient for governments to formulate health policy on the grounds that the average life expectancy of men and women has increased dramatically since 1901.

Taxpayers Against Poverty.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>17 February 2012: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/16/taxpayers-alliance-social-justice"">A taxpayers’ alliance to promote social justice</a></strong></h2> <p>Ministers at the Department of Work and Pensions repeat ad nauseam their mantra: “It is not fair for taxpayers to be asked to pay for the cost of spare bedrooms, or housing benefit which is high in central London because rents are high etc, etc.” Therefore the poorest citizens are thrust into unmanageable debt by caps and cuts in housing benefit, possible eviction, forced migration, undue stress and misery. As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer.</p> <p>I am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of £67.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS.</p> <p>The self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. <a href=""http://oecdinsights.org/2012/01/20/the-government-inspectors/"">Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion</a>, <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5925f75c-03cf-11e0-8c3f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1mv83XZQe"">including bonuses</a>, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that <a href=""http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/100bn-of-central-london-properties-held-in-offshore-tax-havens/1545.article"">£100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas</a> – both out of reach of the taxman. That really is unfair. I hope thousands will join Taxpayers Against Poverty, TAP, to say so loud and clear.

<p>• It is an immense relief to read that the housing debate has at last embraced the free market in land that is at the root of so many of the UK’s troubles. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/haringey-council-claire-kober-momentum-residents"" title="""">Haringey housing battle</a> was about the people’s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages.</p> <p>In the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.<br><strong>Rev Paul

February). Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford.

Plans for his funeral – which takes place today, 30 March 2020, in Tottenham, London – had to be scaled back because of the coronavirus outbreak, and so his children have asked those not able to be there to join them virtually on the day by posting online with the hashtag #RevPaul. Here is an extract from the message they sent out via TAP: Possibly the UK’s most social media-literate octogenarian, Dad was actively engaged with his supporters (and detractors) on social platforms, working with allies to improve the lives of those who are now most affected during this time of crisis. Therefore we feel it is fitting to give those not able to be with us at his funeral a voice via these channels. And you can join us. Do post on Facebook or Tweet or record a short video message answering one or more of these questions: • How should Rev Paul’s community respond to the current crisis? • How will you follow in Rev Paul’s footsteps? • How has Rev Paul touched your life? On Monday 30th March post your text or video tagging Dad’s Facebook and Twitter handles [Twitter: @taxpayers_a_p Facebook: facebook.com/TaxpayersAgainstPovertyUK] with the hashtag #RevPaul. Dad requested that people give to Z2K and TAP rather than buy flowers or cards so please include the https://bitly.com/RevPaul link on all your posts. Later this year we are looking forward to holding a service of thanksgiving and celebration to which everyone will be invited! We hope it will be a great gathering to celebrate his extraordinary life through which the lives of so many others were changed for the better. The things he has been saying for years, that we must provide for the needs of all those in our society, need to be celebrated and broadcast and built upon. And we can all help spread the word. We look forward to meeting you at the memorial later this year, hugging without reservation, and celebrating the life of our extraordinary father. With huge thanks for your love and support, Krissie, Claire, Tom, Hugo and Rod As our tribute to Rev Paul, we have collected together, below, many of those that the Guardian published. 20 July 1999: Paying for laissez-faire You refer to the most fundamental welfare principle of all: an adequate income (Leader, July 19). The standards required are those which will provide for essential needs, good health, satisfactory standards of child development, social cohesion and human dignity. To date, all governments stumble about in the dark. They even set levels of minimum incomes without the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist. As a consequence, poor women have low birthweight babies with high morbidity and mortality rates throughout life. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers die, on average, five years younger. The poor experience double the rate of divorce and a higher rate of suicide among young people. Children who grow up in low-income families are more likely to leave school early after a lower attendance and achievement record and to have more contact with the police. Poverty-related crime, ill health and other expensive consequences of poverty may cost the treasury more than ensuring people have adequate incomes. Lord Morris of Manchester’s amendment to the welfare reform and pensions bill this week will address these issues. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 9 March 2000: The education we deserve Nick Davies concludes “there is almost no connection between reality and the easy consensus of distant journalists and politicians” when comparing Roedean and Stanley Deacon schools. This political malaise affects education, health and crime. We help people prepare their means statements for the magistrates. The reality is that poverty is so bad that decent people are propelled into crime, die young, give birth to underweight children, fall ill through stress and inadequate diet, despair of clothing their children adequately for school and have unmanageable debts. The easy consensus fails to take the government to task for grossly underestimating the depth of poverty which has built up. The hole in the middle of the polo mint policies of the “third way” awaits a diagnosis which admits to the reality, expense and social dangers of the extreme poverty of millions of adults in and out of work in Britain. Rev Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 13 May 2002: New views on an age-old question It is not sufficient for governments to formulate health policy on the grounds that the average life expectancy of men and women has increased dramatically since 1901. In 1972 low-paid men could expect to die aged 66.5 and professional men 5.5 years later. By 1999 low paid men could expect to die aged 71 and the gap had increased to 7.4 years. By 1999 low paid women could expect to live to 77.1 while their professional colleagues could enjoy another 5.7 years. This punitive inequality in death is a measure of social injustice that should spur all political parties to tackle the poverty that lies behind it. Giving free TV licences to the 70% of professional workers who will live to 75 years old when 54% of low-paid workers will not is no part of a relevant policy. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 July 2003: Unobtainable Call centres and IT are being developed for the administrative convenience of government, but are leaving the poor and the vulnerable behind. It is not generally understood in Whitehall that the preferred means of communication of the poorest is now the pay-as-you-go mobile. Once it is paid for, at between £39 and £59, there is no further charge. But a minimum £5 top-up card must be bought to make outgoing calls, none of which is free. 0800 and 0870 calls can cost 10p a minute. Meanwhile, BT has cut off over 1 million landline subscribers and is removing phone boxes. I was recently at the magistrates court in High Wycombe. A young man had no money to pay a fine. He had not signed on for jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). To do that, he had to phone a call centre in Reading, deal with the Jobcentre in High Wycombe and, in the event of a delay in payment, phone the processing centre in Milton Keynes. I phoned the Reading call centre on my mobile to get him started. It took me an expensive 18 minutes to get through and a further five to complete the matter in hand. They were short-staffed in all three centres and it was taking over six weeks to process the benefit applications. Leaving young men on the streets with no money for weeks is dangerous - particularly so when they have just been released from prison. The Jobcentre’s answer was to offer a social fund loan to pay the fine, but repayment would have been deducted from a truly inadequate JSA of £43.25 at £10 a week. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimates that the bare minimum for healthy living should be £84 a week. The High Wycombe magistrates rightly adjourned the case until it was all sorted out. Rev Paul Nicolson Zaccheus 2000 Trust 19 January 2005: Work to do It is necessary to qualify the accolade on the government’s record of reducing child poverty (Letters, January 18). The treatment of housing costs and tax in the statistics used and the damaging effect of the home credit market on poverty incomes call into question the claim that 700,000 children have been “lifted out of poverty”. The number of pensioners, families and working-age adults in poverty increased from 1979 to 1997, and, certainly for pensioners and families, the present government has reversed that trend (Letters, January 18). That is a significant achievement. But there has been no change or policy for working-age adults since 1997. There is a long way to go before Britain returns to lower levels of poverty Rev Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 4 May 2005 David Brindle is right to ask questions about the social fund. (Opinion, April 13). The problem lies with the inadequacy of unemployment benefits that force households to borrow. In Wycombe magistrates court, where we attend every week to help people who cannot pay their fines prepare their means statements, three young men came in who had no money. It was going to take weeks to process their benefit applications for £44.50 a week; one man faced a two-week wait for the interview at the jobcentre that would decide if he was eligible. Meanwhile the jobcentre offered a crisis loan of £60 from the social fund. When the benefit is ultimately paid, the repayments of the loan will be deducted at source at £10 a week and the fine at £5 a week, leaving £29.50. Budget standards research shows that, as a national average, these men need £91 a week in order to live healthily, but £125 in London and the south-east. The Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 5 April 2006: The fight against child poverty Polly Toynbee is right to call the poverty lobby to account. We are a disparate, disorganised, competing lot that need to get our act together in order to reveal to the public the true and damaging nature of poverty in the UK. There is a powerful coalition of charities, faiths, health professionals and trades unions existing in embryo. It will need organisational drive. Then we could mount a powerful national campaign on the issues that matter most to the poorest citizens. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 5 June 2006: Trapped in tax credit chaos Polly Toynbee is right - very many families in steady employment with few changes of circumstances have gained from tax credits. It all falls apart for vulnerable households when a change of circumstances involves fulfilling their duty to inform HMRC about tax credits and child benefit, the local authority about housing and council tax benefits and the jobcentre about jobseeker’s allowance and disability benefits. Cases are entering the courts where those on the lowest incomes are expected to repay around £7,000 or more in overpayments to all agencies. Enforcement is driven by computers that have no means of identifying the illiterate, blind, disabled, pregnant, poor, mentally or chronically ill and in some cases dead. The starting points are threats of eviction for rent arrears or prison for council tax arrears. An overpayment of tax credits can lead to a downward spiral of a family’s fortunes into a morass of debt. Rev Paul Nicholson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 19 June 2006: Tighten the belt on Britain’s expanding waistline While moves to tackle the obesity crisis are welcome, what about the link between nutrition and the mental health super crisis? The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between £990m and £1,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from £965m in 1983-84 to £5bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe. The Unicef/WHO 2004 analysis has Britain at 8%, on a par with Romania, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. In some inner-city areas in the UK the incidence reaches developing nations’ rates of 11% to 14%. Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 29 September 2006 Britain must target child poverty Collette Marshall is right to emphasise the depth of poverty of the 1 million children suffering the severest income inequalities here. In societies where income differences between rich and poor are smaller not only do the levels of educational attainment among schoolchildren tend to be higher but also community life is stronger and people are much more likely to trust each other. There is less violence - including substantially lower homicide rates - health is better and life expectancy is several years longer. Prison populations are smaller, birth rates among teenagers are lower. Meanwhile, in Britain, unaffordable housing, debt, chronic overcrowding and a complex benefits system massively increase the stress of inequality in poor families. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 20 October 2006: We’re not green Adam Smith would not only have taxed the rich (Letters, October 19), he also concerned himself with the reasonable needs of the poor. He argued that social necessities were no less important than physical necessities. “By necessaries I understand not only the commodities, which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to go without”. The government has refused requests to set up a Minimum Income Standards Commission. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 November 2006: Polly’s stand on poverty It is not valid to describe the worst poverty in the UK as relative (If Cameron can climb on my caravan, anything is possible, November 23). Until politicians of all colours face the reality of absolute poverty here in Britain, they will not create policies to combat it. For example, around 60,000 young people leave care every year at the age of 16 with no financial or family support. When, or if, weeks later, the local authority gets around to carrying out their duty to assess their needs, they receive £34.60 a week until the age of 18, after rent and council tax, on which to survive independently. They are absolutely poor. The Family Budget Unit estimates that the minimum income standard for childless adults is a very tight £85 a week. Many migrants and UK nationals work in the black economy for much less than the national minimum wage and all statutory minimum incomes are below the government’s poverty thresholds. To have no money anywhere is absolute poverty. To have far too little money in an expensive developed economy also threatens survival and is also absolute poverty. There are well-established truths that the poorest citizens in the UK are more likely to be ill, to die younger and to be disadvantaged in our schools. The prisons are full of people for whom survival became the overriding consideration. The pips are squeaking in the poorest households in the UK. Talk of relative poverty should be replaced by a debate that faces these facts. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 June 2007: Campaign of pain It is not only the residents of private care homes (No human rights for old in private homes, June 20) who are left without the protection of the human rights legislation after the decision of the House of Lords. The same anomaly exists whenever private companies undertake work that is paid for and is identical to that undertaken by public bodies. Public bodies can be challenged in law but private companies cannot. For example, some bailiffs are employed by local authorities to enforce council tax while others are employed by private companies doing identical work. The former can be challenged about irrational decisions against vulnerable debtors but, it seems, not the private companies. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 July 2007: How to construct fairer access to housing The government’s housing policy fails to grasp the nettles of lending and land reform at the heart of the housing crisis (Everyone is entitled to a stake in the nation’s soil and bricks, July 24). Doing as little as possible in order to avoid losing the votes of houseowners, or to win the votes of those who cannot get on to the housing ladder, is not a housing policy. The rising value of land will continue to lead to ever-expanding inequalities in wealth as long as politicians treat it like a market with unlimited supply. The richer the wealthy become, the more they compete for the limited supply of land, squeezing poorer households with ever higher rents and the middle-class taxpayer with ever higher housing benefit, likely to exceed £20bn next year. The taxation of land is back to front. It is taxed with business rates and council tax when in use but never when it lies idle. An annual land-value tax on all land, replacing the deeply regressive council tax, would discourage speculators from leaving property idle while waiting to sell and take the capital gain. Increasing the supply of housing will not catch up with demand or reduce prices for decades, if ever; so the regulation of lending to prevent banks flooding with money a market in short supply should be reintroduced. Finally, such schemes as community land trusts and limited liability partnerships, which remove land from the market in perpetuity, enabling rent and purchase at affordable prices, should be given maximum support by government. Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 31 August 2007: Creating wealth – and poverty All is not as well in Britain as Sigmund Sternberg (Letters, August 30) would have us believe. All of us do not benefit from the way the free market is run by entrepreneurs, who undertake the vital task of managing the creation of wealth. An independent inquiry into inequalities in health reported in 1999 that average incomes in the UK grew in real terms by about 40% between 1979 and 1994-95, but this growth was far greater (60-68%) among the richest 10th of the population. For the poorest 10th, average income increased by only 10% (before housing costs) or fell by 8% (after them). The Institute for Public Policy Research has estimated that the value of personally owned housing has risen from £36bn to £1,525bn in the past 30 years; but the number of people with no assets at all has doubled over the last 20 years from 5% to 10%. Economic inequality continues to increase; it is damaging social cohesion. Neither Sternberg’s rose-tinted spectacles nor the spray-gun approach to condemning the free market, capitalism and City bonuses will create a nation at ease with itself; but much will depend on Sternberg and his colleagues opening their eyes to the poverty they create, alongside the wealth and to reverse the trend. We seek justice, not charity. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 11 September 2007: New laws won’t change the business of sex Prosecuting men for buying sex will deprive too many men and women of an income they would not choose to earn but for their extreme poverty. Will the government ensure that the poorest of them, who are paid for sex, have sufficient benefits, tax credits or minimum wage to ensure that prostitution is not a necessary survival strategy? Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 14 November 2007: Financial time bomb faces the poor Polly Toynbee asks why nothing has been done about subprime lenders like Provident, who charge lone mothers receiving unemployment benefits £700 on a £1,000 loan. We can tell her. Debt on our Doorstep and ourselves gave evidence to the Competition Commission’s enquiry into home credit and lobbied MPs and peers during the passage of the consumer credit bill calling for a cap on interest rates. We were opposed by academics, the National Consumer Council and the National Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, which all bought Provident’s gigantic bluff that if there were a cap on interest, it would go out of business, leaving the home credit market to loan sharks. None of our opponents worked out the level of interest at which Provident could comfortably stay in business. This trust is currently supporting an unemployed lone mother who was given her first TV, but did not buy a licence for three weeks. She was fined £270. In a panic she borrowed £270 with £150 interest from Provident and paid the fine in cash. But she then faced a claim for bailiff and court costs. They all ignored national standards for enforcement agents covering vulnerable situations, which requires such a case to be returned to court, where the magistrates can remit all or part of the fine. This is what happened when a colleague overheard the distressed woman telling her story in a cafe and referred her to us. The government fails to coordinate the jaws of state; it sinks its teeth into the lowest incomes, while avoiding any limit on eating up poverty incomes. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 July 2008: We need the courage to fight poverty There is a strong desire in parliament and among NGOs and some employers to end poverty in the UK; but there are as many policies for doing it as there are government departments and NGO campaigns. The Family Budget Unit and The Centre for Social Policy Research have now provided a focus on the weekly cost of minimum needs for a healthy life and essential participation in the community, in their publication of minimum income standards yesterday. The economy cannot afford to leave statutory minimum incomes so low that costly poverty-related ill health and educational underachievement flood into excellent hospitals and schools, and crime into the courts and prisons; nor to leave those inadequate incomes to reach their beneficiaries through the stressful maze of four statutory agencies. The chaotic housing market adds to the stress of poverty in the UK, with futile attempts to reform the housing benefit system, all of which make poverty worse. The absence of housing supply and the deregulation of lending have combined to lift the cost of housing benefit from £5.4bn in 1988 to £20bn now. The scandal of state-imposed welfare poverty makes people ill and stops their children getting a decent education. It is in the taxpayer’s interest to end poverty with adequate incomes and save billions. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 15 September 2008: A chilling winter of discontent Whitehall has introduced bureaucratic solutions to fuel poverty by making the vulnerable and impoverished apply for social tariffs and insulation (Lofty ideals, September 12). A minister on TV was telling people to make a phone call, apparently not knowing that BT has cut off 1m land lines, and pay-as-you-go mobile phones quickly run out of credit hanging on to “free-phone” calls at 50p a minute. The winter fuel payment is paid direct into pensioners’ accounts, but 1.8 million are not so lucky because they have not applied for pension credit because it is too intimidating, humiliating and fault prone for many of them. Without a direct and uncomplicated injection of cash through the benefit system it is certain that the utility companies will attend the magistrates’ courts with sheaves of applications to break into the homes of impoverished customers who cannot pay their bills to install pay as you go meters, charging the customer both the court costs, and more for fuel than those who pay by direct debit. Come the winter some people in perfectly insulated houses will not have the money to feed the meters or themselves. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 22 December 2008: Moral hazard of forcing people into poverty Polly Toynbee is right to highlight the inadequacy of the unemployment benefit for single adults of £60.50 a week (The prospect of another lost generation is a chilling one, 20 December); it is half the government’s poverty threshold and 42% of the minimum income needed for healthy living as established by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It will increase to just £64.30 in April 2009. Economists and civil servants have always advised politicians about the moral hazard that people will not go to work if their unemployment benefit is too high, but forget the moral hazard when it is below the minimum needed for healthy survival, which is a powerful motivator pushing decent people over the top into immoral and illegal behaviour. That is the danger of fining the unemployed for a failure to engage with the authorities about work or training; benefits are already far too low in this very expensive economy. There is no justice in the government preaching about rights and responsibilities to its poorest citizens when it has not accepted the responsibility to provide adequate minimum incomes in work or unemployment. The minimum wage is a poverty wage in London and many other areas. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 January 2009: Churches need to revive a truly rigorous Christian critique of the free market The Bishop of Durham is not as wrong in claiming the poor have got poorer under New Labour, who have called a halt to the rise in the numbers of pensioners and children in poverty under the Conservatives, but failed the very poor. A report by Save the Children in 2005 found that there has been little or no improvement in the proportion of children living in severe poverty since 1997. The Centre Forum calculated the number of people with incomes below 40% of the median income, rather than the government’s poverty threshold of 60%, and found that it had increased by 250,000 between 1994-05 and 2003-04. On the governments measure, the number of childless adults in poverty increased by 500,000 between 1996-97 and 2005-06. Since 2004 the number of children and adults below the government’s poverty threshold has started to increase and this year the rising prices of food, utilities and transport have hit the 2.5 million pensioners and 3.9 million children below the threshold. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 March 2009: Support people rather than jobs Polly Toynbee tells of the incredulity of the newly unemployed when they find their benefit is a workhouse rate of £60.50 a week. Incredulity is multiplied by the reply of the government to a debate about increasing it initiated by Julie Jones MP in the third reading of the welfare reform bill. She was told that would fundamentally undermine what the benefits system and the welfare state are there for. The government should re-read the 1942 Beveridge report, which recommended that the benefit scheme should embody principles including unification of administrative responsibility, now shattered into many agencies; and adequacy, totally ignored by all British governments; and added that the aim of the plan for social security is to make want under any circumstances unnecessary. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 11 May 2009: Wealth, poverty and a glaring disparity The 7.5 million adults of working age living in poverty in the UK, an increase of 800,000 since 1998, are often left out of press comment on government statistics. Many are receiving poverty incomes while unemployed, which are due to be sanctioned should they not seek work. John Mason MP, supported by Paul Rowen MP, tabled amendments to the welfare reform bill designed to ensure sanctions do not leave claimants with an income too low to sustain healthy living and are not applied in ignorance of a claimant’s means. The government replied the amendments missed the basic point because there is a contract between the applicant and the state and, if one obeys the rules, no sanctions will be applied. However, rights and responsibilities apply both ways. Since 1948, successive British governments have been signed up to the right to an adequate standard of living as detailed in the UN’s convention on human rights, but have not honoured their side of the contract by implementing that right in adequate unemployment incomes. We hope peers debating the bill will understand that reducing with sanctions £50.95 a week adult unemployment benefit for 18-25-year-olds, or £64.30 thereafter, which is less than half the poverty threshold, can never be justified by a shallow appeal to an unjust social contract. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 22 May 2009: Double blow for poor mothers The tragedy is (Jenni Russell, 21 May) that ministers for decades have swallowed hook, line and bath plug the message of their advisers that an unemployment income below subsistence level at £64.30 a week is needed to force the idle into work. European countries pay 53% to 69% of average earnings to a jobless adult, quite low enough to encourage willing human beings to seek employment, while Britain pays 40%. The welfare reform bill will reduce that £64.30 paid to lone mothers if they do not seek work or engage in work-related activity. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 13 June 2009: Welfare bill won’t reduce poverty The welfare reform bill ignores one essential principle, which should inform all of the many regulations about job-seeking conditions, work-related activities etc. Lord Northbourne’s amendment, supported in the debate by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, but not by the government, requires due consideration to be given to the wellbeing of any child whose life might be affected by the decisions of officials implementing such regulations. The government’s good intentions are marred by an overemphasis on the benefit to a family of parents moving out of unemployment into work. Children become official barriers to work rather than the overriding responsibility of parents. Work is beneficial if it is adequately paid and the children are not harmed because the parental bond is strained or broken when they are put into childcare at crucial stages of their educational and emotional development. The bill has the balance of power wrong at the point where officialdom touches family life. The social security advisory committee questioned the government’s primary analysis that people are unwilling to work and unlikely to work, and need to be coerced into employment. A more socially aware analysis is that parents love their children, want to do their best for them and should have their commitment empowered and encouraged.

As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer. I am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of £67.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS. The self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion, including bonuses, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that £100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas – both out of reach of the taxman. That really is unfair. I hope thousands will join Taxpayers Against Poverty, TAP, to say so loud and clear. All we need is an email.

housing debate has at last embraced the free market in land that is at the root of so many of the UK’s troubles. The Haringey housing battle was about the people’s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages. In the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.

Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford. Hence the 79% increase in homeless families in England to 86,000, including 127,000 children since 2010, some for up to and over 10 years, 1.1 million households on council waiting lists and 4,700 single adults sleeping rough each night. The New Economics Foundation recently reported that the government sold enough public land for developers to build 131,000 homes, but only 2.6% will be for social rent. There is an urgent need for legislation that forbids the sale of public land and requires it to be used for affordable social housing.

Semi-skilled and unskilled workers die, on average, five years younger. The poor experience double the rate of divorce and a higher rate of suicide among young people. Children who grow up in low-income families are more likely to leave school early after a lower attendance and achievement record and to have more contact with the police.</p> <p>Poverty-related crime, ill health and other expensive consequences of poverty may cost the treasury more than ensuring people have adequate incomes.

This political malaise affects education, health and crime. We help people prepare their means statements for the magistrates. The reality is that poverty is so bad that decent people are propelled into crime, die young, give birth to underweight children, fall ill through stress and inadequate diet, despair of clothing their children adequately for school and have unmanageable debts.</p> <p>The easy consensus fails to take the government to task for grossly underestimating the depth of poverty which has built up.

In 1972 low-paid men could expect to die aged 66.5 and professional men 5.5 years later. By 1999 low paid men could expect to die aged 71 and the gap had increased to 7.4 years. By 1999 low paid women could expect to live to 77.1 while their professional colleagues could enjoy another 5.7 years.</p> <p>This punitive inequality in death is a measure of social injustice that should spur all political parties to tackle the poverty that lies behind it.

The treatment of housing costs and tax in the statistics used and the damaging effect of the home credit market on poverty incomes call into question the claim that 700,000 children have been “lifted out of poverty”. The number of pensioners, families and working-age adults in poverty increased from 1979 to 1997, and, certainly for pensioners and families, the present government has reversed that trend (Letters, January 18).

It all falls apart for vulnerable households when a change of circumstances involves fulfilling their duty to inform HMRC about tax credits and child benefit, the local authority about housing and council tax benefits and the jobcentre about jobseeker’s allowance and disability benefits.

The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between £990m and £1,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from £965m in 1983-84 to £5bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe. The Unicef/WHO 2004 analysis has Britain at 8%, on a par with Romania, Mongolia and Kazakhstan.

In societies where income differences between rich and poor are smaller not only do the levels of educational attainment among schoolchildren tend to be higher but also community life is stronger and people are much more likely to trust each other. There is less violence - including substantially lower homicide rates - health is better and life expectancy is several years longer. Prison populations are smaller, birth rates among teenagers are lower. Meanwhile, in Britain, unaffordable housing, debt, chronic overcrowding and a complex benefits system massively increase the stress of inequality in poor families.<br><strong>Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Zacchaeus 2000 Trust</em></p> <h2><strong>20 October 2006: </strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/20/mainsection.guardianletters"">We’re not green</a></h2> <p>Adam Smith would not only have taxed the rich (Letters, October 19), he also concerned himself with the reasonable needs of the poor.

Until politicians of all colours face the reality of absolute poverty here in Britain, they will not create policies to combat it. For example, around 60,000 young people leave care every year at the age of 16 with no financial or family support. When, or if, weeks later, the local authority gets around to carrying out their duty to assess their needs, they receive £34.60 a week until the age of 18, after rent and council tax, on which to survive independently.

To have far too little money in an expensive developed economy also threatens survival and is also absolute poverty. There are well-established truths that the poorest citizens in the UK are more likely to be ill, to die younger and to be disadvantaged in our schools.

The same anomaly exists whenever private companies undertake work that is paid for and is identical to that undertaken by public bodies. Public bodies can be challenged in law but private companies cannot.

We can tell her. Debt on our Doorstep and ourselves gave evidence to the Competition Commission’s enquiry into home credit and lobbied MPs and peers during the passage of the consumer credit bill calling for a cap on interest rates.</p> <p>We were opposed by academics, the National Consumer Council and the National Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, which all bought Provident’s gigantic bluff that if there were a cap on interest, it would go out of business, leaving the home credit market to loan sharks. None of our opponents worked out the level of interest at which Provident could comfortably stay in business.</p> <p>This trust is currently supporting an unemployed lone mother who was given her first TV, but did not buy a licence for three weeks. She was fined £270. In a panic she borrowed £270 with £150 interest from Provident and paid the fine in cash. But she then faced a claim for bailiff and court costs. They all ignored national standards for enforcement agents covering vulnerable situations, which requires such a case to be returned to court, where the magistrates can remit all or part of the fine.

That is the danger of fining the unemployed for a failure to engage with the authorities about work or training; benefits are already far too low in this very expensive economy.

Many are receiving poverty incomes while unemployed, which are due to be sanctioned should they not seek work. John Mason MP, supported by Paul Rowen MP, tabled amendments to the welfare reform bill designed to ensure sanctions do not leave claimants with an income too low to sustain healthy living and are not applied in ignorance of a claimant’s means.</p> <p>The government replied the amendments missed the basic point because there is a contract between the applicant and the state and, if one obeys the rules, no sanctions will be applied. However, rights and responsibilities apply both ways. Since 1948, successive British governments have been signed up to the right to an adequate standard of living as detailed in the UN’s convention on human rights, but have not honoured their side of the contract by implementing that right in adequate unemployment incomes. We hope peers debating the bill will understand that reducing with sanctions £50.95 a week adult unemployment benefit for 18-25-year-olds, or £64.30 thereafter, which is less than half the poverty threshold, can never be justified by a shallow appeal to an unjust social contract.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust</em></p> <h2><strong>22 May 2009: </strong><a href=""Double%20blow%20for%20poor%20mothers"">Double blow for poor mothers</a></h2> <p>The tragedy is (Jenni Russell, 21 May) that ministers for decades have swallowed hook, line and bath plug the message of their advisers that an unemployment income below subsistence level at £64.30 a week is needed to force the idle into work. European countries pay 53% to 69% of average earnings to a jobless adult, quite low enough to encourage willing human beings to seek employment, while Britain pays 40%. The welfare reform bill will reduce that £64.30 paid to lone mothers if they do not seek work or engage in work-related activity.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust</em></p> <h2><strong>13 June 2009: </strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/jun/13/letters-welfare-reform-bill"">Welfare bill won’t reduce poverty</a></h2> <p>The welfare reform bill ignores one essential principle, which should inform all of the many regulations about job-seeking conditions, work-related activities etc. Lord Northbourne’s amendment, supported in the debate by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, but not by the government, requires due consideration to be given to the wellbeing of any child whose life might be affected by the decisions of officials implementing such regulations.</p> <p>The government’s good intentions are marred by an overemphasis on the benefit to a family of parents moving out of unemployment into work. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/children"">Children</a> become official barriers to work rather than the overriding responsibility of parents. Work is beneficial if it is adequately paid and the children are not harmed because the parental bond is strained or broken when they are put into childcare at crucial stages of their educational and emotional development.</p> <p>The bill has the balance of power wrong at the point where officialdom touches family life. The social security advisory committee questioned the government’s primary analysis that people are unwilling to work and unlikely to work, and need to be coerced into employment. A more socially aware analysis is that parents love their children, want to do their best for them and should have their commitment empowered and encouraged.<br><strong>Rev Paul

promote social justice</a></strong></h2> <p>Ministers at the Department of Work and Pensions repeat ad nauseam their mantra: “It is not fair for taxpayers to be asked to pay for the cost of spare bedrooms, or housing benefit which is high in central London because rents are high etc, etc.” Therefore the poorest citizens are thrust into unmanageable debt by caps and cuts in housing benefit, possible eviction, forced migration, undue stress and misery. As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer.</p> <p>I am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of £67.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS.</p> <p>The self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. <a href=""http://oecdinsights.org/2012/01/20/the-government-inspectors/"">Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion</a>, <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5925f75c-03cf-11e0-8c3f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1mv83XZQe"">including bonuses</a>, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that <a href=""http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/100bn-of-central-london-properties-held-in-offshore-tax-havens/1545.article"">£100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas</a> – both out of reach of the taxman.

He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.<br><strong>Rev Paul

February). Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford.

Plans for his funeral – which takes place today, 30 March 2020, in Tottenham, London – had to be scaled back because of the coronavirus outbreak, and so his children have asked those not able to be there to join them virtually on the day by posting online with the hashtag #RevPaul. Here is an extract from the message they sent out via TAP: Possibly the UK’s most social media-literate octogenarian, Dad was actively engaged with his supporters (and detractors) on social platforms, working with allies to improve the lives of those who are now most affected during this time of crisis. Therefore we feel it is fitting to give those not able to be with us at his funeral a voice via these channels. And you can join us. Do post on Facebook or Tweet or record a short video message answering one or more of these questions: • How should Rev Paul’s community respond to the current crisis? • How will you follow in Rev Paul’s footsteps? • How has Rev Paul touched your life? On Monday 30th March post your text or video tagging Dad’s Facebook and Twitter handles [Twitter: @taxpayers_a_p Facebook: facebook.com/TaxpayersAgainstPovertyUK] with the hashtag #RevPaul. Dad requested that people give to Z2K and TAP rather than buy flowers or cards so please include the https://bitly.com/RevPaul link on all your posts. Later this year we are looking forward to holding a service of thanksgiving and celebration to which everyone will be invited! We hope it will be a great gathering to celebrate his extraordinary life through which the lives of so many others were changed for the better. The things he has been saying for years, that we must provide for the needs of all those in our society, need to be celebrated and broadcast and built upon. And we can all help spread the word. We look forward to meeting you at the memorial later this year, hugging without reservation, and celebrating the life of our extraordinary father. With huge thanks for your love and support, Krissie, Claire, Tom, Hugo and Rod As our tribute to Rev Paul, we have collected together, below, many of those that the Guardian published. 20 July 1999: Paying for laissez-faire You refer to the most fundamental welfare principle of all: an adequate income (Leader, July 19). The standards required are those which will provide for essential needs, good health, satisfactory standards of child development, social cohesion and human dignity. To date, all governments stumble about in the dark. They even set levels of minimum incomes without the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist. As a consequence, poor women have low birthweight babies with high morbidity and mortality rates throughout life. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers die, on average, five years younger. The poor experience double the rate of divorce and a higher rate of suicide among young people. Children who grow up in low-income families are more likely to leave school early after a lower attendance and achievement record and to have more contact with the police. Poverty-related crime, ill health and other expensive consequences of poverty may cost the treasury more than ensuring people have adequate incomes. Lord Morris of Manchester’s amendment to the welfare reform and pensions bill this week will address these issues. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 9 March 2000: The education we deserve Nick Davies concludes “there is almost no connection between reality and the easy consensus of distant journalists and politicians” when comparing Roedean and Stanley Deacon schools. This political malaise affects education, health and crime. We help people prepare their means statements for the magistrates. The reality is that poverty is so bad that decent people are propelled into crime, die young, give birth to underweight children, fall ill through stress and inadequate diet, despair of clothing their children adequately for school and have unmanageable debts. The easy consensus fails to take the government to task for grossly underestimating the depth of poverty which has built up. The hole in the middle of the polo mint policies of the “third way” awaits a diagnosis which admits to the reality, expense and social dangers of the extreme poverty of millions of adults in and out of work in Britain. Rev Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 13 May 2002: New views on an age-old question It is not sufficient for governments to formulate health policy on the grounds that the average life expectancy of men and women has increased dramatically since 1901. In 1972 low-paid men could expect to die aged 66.5 and professional men 5.5 years later. By 1999 low paid men could expect to die aged 71 and the gap had increased to 7.4 years. By 1999 low paid women could expect to live to 77.1 while their professional colleagues could enjoy another 5.7 years. This punitive inequality in death is a measure of social injustice that should spur all political parties to tackle the poverty that lies behind it. Giving free TV licences to the 70% of professional workers who will live to 75 years old when 54% of low-paid workers will not is no part of a relevant policy. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 July 2003: Unobtainable Call centres and IT are being developed for the administrative convenience of government, but are leaving the poor and the vulnerable behind. It is not generally understood in Whitehall that the preferred means of communication of the poorest is now the pay-as-you-go mobile. Once it is paid for, at between £39 and £59, there is no further charge. But a minimum £5 top-up card must be bought to make outgoing calls, none of which is free. 0800 and 0870 calls can cost 10p a minute. Meanwhile, BT has cut off over 1 million landline subscribers and is removing phone boxes. I was recently at the magistrates court in High Wycombe. A young man had no money to pay a fine. He had not signed on for jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). To do that, he had to phone a call centre in Reading, deal with the Jobcentre in High Wycombe and, in the event of a delay in payment, phone the processing centre in Milton Keynes. I phoned the Reading call centre on my mobile to get him started. It took me an expensive 18 minutes to get through and a further five to complete the matter in hand. They were short-staffed in all three centres and it was taking over six weeks to process the benefit applications. Leaving young men on the streets with no money for weeks is dangerous - particularly so when they have just been released from prison. The Jobcentre’s answer was to offer a social fund loan to pay the fine, but repayment would have been deducted from a truly inadequate JSA of £43.25 at £10 a week. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimates that the bare minimum for healthy living should be £84 a week. The High Wycombe magistrates rightly adjourned the case until it was all sorted out. Rev Paul Nicolson Zaccheus 2000 Trust 19 January 2005: Work to do It is necessary to qualify the accolade on the government’s record of reducing child poverty (Letters, January 18). The treatment of housing costs and tax in the statistics used and the damaging effect of the home credit market on poverty incomes call into question the claim that 700,000 children have been “lifted out of poverty”. The number of pensioners, families and working-age adults in poverty increased from 1979 to 1997, and, certainly for pensioners and families, the present government has reversed that trend (Letters, January 18). That is a significant achievement. But there has been no change or policy for working-age adults since 1997. There is a long way to go before Britain returns to lower levels of poverty Rev Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 4 May 2005 David Brindle is right to ask questions about the social fund. (Opinion, April 13). The problem lies with the inadequacy of unemployment benefits that force households to borrow. In Wycombe magistrates court, where we attend every week to help people who cannot pay their fines prepare their means statements, three young men came in who had no money. It was going to take weeks to process their benefit applications for £44.50 a week; one man faced a two-week wait for the interview at the jobcentre that would decide if he was eligible. Meanwhile the jobcentre offered a crisis loan of £60 from the social fund. When the benefit is ultimately paid, the repayments of the loan will be deducted at source at £10 a week and the fine at £5 a week, leaving £29.50. Budget standards research shows that, as a national average, these men need £91 a week in order to live healthily, but £125 in London and the south-east. The Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 5 April 2006: The fight against child poverty Polly Toynbee is right to call the poverty lobby to account. We are a disparate, disorganised, competing lot that need to get our act together in order to reveal to the public the true and damaging nature of poverty in the UK. There is a powerful coalition of charities, faiths, health professionals and trades unions existing in embryo. It will need organisational drive. Then we could mount a powerful national campaign on the issues that matter most to the poorest citizens. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 5 June 2006: Trapped in tax credit chaos Polly Toynbee is right - very many families in steady employment with few changes of circumstances have gained from tax credits. It all falls apart for vulnerable households when a change of circumstances involves fulfilling their duty to inform HMRC about tax credits and child benefit, the local authority about housing and council tax benefits and the jobcentre about jobseeker’s allowance and disability benefits. Cases are entering the courts where those on the lowest incomes are expected to repay around £7,000 or more in overpayments to all agencies. Enforcement is driven by computers that have no means of identifying the illiterate, blind, disabled, pregnant, poor, mentally or chronically ill and in some cases dead. The starting points are threats of eviction for rent arrears or prison for council tax arrears. An overpayment of tax credits can lead to a downward spiral of a family’s fortunes into a morass of debt. Rev Paul Nicholson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 19 June 2006: Tighten the belt on Britain’s expanding waistline While moves to tackle the obesity crisis are welcome, what about the link between nutrition and the mental health super crisis? The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between £990m and £1,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from £965m in 1983-84 to £5bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe. The Unicef/WHO 2004 analysis has Britain at 8%, on a par with Romania, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. In some inner-city areas in the UK the incidence reaches developing nations’ rates of 11% to 14%. Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 29 September 2006 Britain must target child poverty Collette Marshall is right to emphasise the depth of poverty of the 1 million children suffering the severest income inequalities here. In societies where income differences between rich and poor are smaller not only do the levels of educational attainment among schoolchildren tend to be higher but also community life is stronger and people are much more likely to trust each other. There is less violence - including substantially lower homicide rates - health is better and life expectancy is several years longer. Prison populations are smaller, birth rates among teenagers are lower. Meanwhile, in Britain, unaffordable housing, debt, chronic overcrowding and a complex benefits system massively increase the stress of inequality in poor families. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 20 October 2006: We’re not green Adam Smith would not only have taxed the rich (Letters, October 19), he also concerned himself with the reasonable needs of the poor. He argued that social necessities were no less important than physical necessities. “By necessaries I understand not only the commodities, which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to go without”. The government has refused requests to set up a Minimum Income Standards Commission. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 November 2006: Polly’s stand on poverty It is not valid to describe the worst poverty in the UK as relative (If Cameron can climb on my caravan, anything is possible, November 23). Until politicians of all colours face the reality of absolute poverty here in Britain, they will not create policies to combat it. For example, around 60,000 young people leave care every year at the age of 16 with no financial or family support. When, or if, weeks later, the local authority gets around to carrying out their duty to assess their needs, they receive £34.60 a week until the age of 18, after rent and council tax, on which to survive independently. They are absolutely poor. The Family Budget Unit estimates that the minimum income standard for childless adults is a very tight £85 a week. Many migrants and UK nationals work in the black economy for much less than the national minimum wage and all statutory minimum incomes are below the government’s poverty thresholds. To have no money anywhere is absolute poverty. To have far too little money in an expensive developed economy also threatens survival and is also absolute poverty. There are well-established truths that the poorest citizens in the UK are more likely to be ill, to die younger and to be disadvantaged in our schools. The prisons are full of people for whom survival became the overriding consideration. The pips are squeaking in the poorest households in the UK. Talk of relative poverty should be replaced by a debate that faces these facts. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 June 2007: Campaign of pain It is not only the residents of private care homes (No human rights for old in private homes, June 20) who are left without the protection of the human rights legislation after the decision of the House of Lords. The same anomaly exists whenever private companies undertake work that is paid for and is identical to that undertaken by public bodies. Public bodies can be challenged in law but private companies cannot. For example, some bailiffs are employed by local authorities to enforce council tax while others are employed by private companies doing identical work. The former can be challenged about irrational decisions against vulnerable debtors but, it seems, not the private companies. Paul Nicolson Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 July 2007: How to construct fairer access to housing The government’s housing policy fails to grasp the nettles of lending and land reform at the heart of the housing crisis (Everyone is entitled to a stake in the nation’s soil and bricks, July 24). Doing as little as possible in order to avoid losing the votes of houseowners, or to win the votes of those who cannot get on to the housing ladder, is not a housing policy. The rising value of land will continue to lead to ever-expanding inequalities in wealth as long as politicians treat it like a market with unlimited supply. The richer the wealthy become, the more they compete for the limited supply of land, squeezing poorer households with ever higher rents and the middle-class taxpayer with ever higher housing benefit, likely to exceed £20bn next year. The taxation of land is back to front. It is taxed with business rates and council tax when in use but never when it lies idle. An annual land-value tax on all land, replacing the deeply regressive council tax, would discourage speculators from leaving property idle while waiting to sell and take the capital gain. Increasing the supply of housing will not catch up with demand or reduce prices for decades, if ever; so the regulation of lending to prevent banks flooding with money a market in short supply should be reintroduced. Finally, such schemes as community land trusts and limited liability partnerships, which remove land from the market in perpetuity, enabling rent and purchase at affordable prices, should be given maximum support by government. Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 31 August 2007: Creating wealth – and poverty All is not as well in Britain as Sigmund Sternberg (Letters, August 30) would have us believe. All of us do not benefit from the way the free market is run by entrepreneurs, who undertake the vital task of managing the creation of wealth. An independent inquiry into inequalities in health reported in 1999 that average incomes in the UK grew in real terms by about 40% between 1979 and 1994-95, but this growth was far greater (60-68%) among the richest 10th of the population. For the poorest 10th, average income increased by only 10% (before housing costs) or fell by 8% (after them). The Institute for Public Policy Research has estimated that the value of personally owned housing has risen from £36bn to £1,525bn in the past 30 years; but the number of people with no assets at all has doubled over the last 20 years from 5% to 10%. Economic inequality continues to increase; it is damaging social cohesion. Neither Sternberg’s rose-tinted spectacles nor the spray-gun approach to condemning the free market, capitalism and City bonuses will create a nation at ease with itself; but much will depend on Sternberg and his colleagues opening their eyes to the poverty they create, alongside the wealth and to reverse the trend. We seek justice, not charity. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 11 September 2007: New laws won’t change the business of sex Prosecuting men for buying sex will deprive too many men and women of an income they would not choose to earn but for their extreme poverty. Will the government ensure that the poorest of them, who are paid for sex, have sufficient benefits, tax credits or minimum wage to ensure that prostitution is not a necessary survival strategy? Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 14 November 2007: Financial time bomb faces the poor Polly Toynbee asks why nothing has been done about subprime lenders like Provident, who charge lone mothers receiving unemployment benefits £700 on a £1,000 loan. We can tell her. Debt on our Doorstep and ourselves gave evidence to the Competition Commission’s enquiry into home credit and lobbied MPs and peers during the passage of the consumer credit bill calling for a cap on interest rates. We were opposed by academics, the National Consumer Council and the National Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, which all bought Provident’s gigantic bluff that if there were a cap on interest, it would go out of business, leaving the home credit market to loan sharks. None of our opponents worked out the level of interest at which Provident could comfortably stay in business. This trust is currently supporting an unemployed lone mother who was given her first TV, but did not buy a licence for three weeks. She was fined £270. In a panic she borrowed £270 with £150 interest from Provident and paid the fine in cash. But she then faced a claim for bailiff and court costs. They all ignored national standards for enforcement agents covering vulnerable situations, which requires such a case to be returned to court, where the magistrates can remit all or part of the fine. This is what happened when a colleague overheard the distressed woman telling her story in a cafe and referred her to us. The government fails to coordinate the jaws of state; it sinks its teeth into the lowest incomes, while avoiding any limit on eating up poverty incomes. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 July 2008: We need the courage to fight poverty There is a strong desire in parliament and among NGOs and some employers to end poverty in the UK; but there are as many policies for doing it as there are government departments and NGO campaigns. The Family Budget Unit and The Centre for Social Policy Research have now provided a focus on the weekly cost of minimum needs for a healthy life and essential participation in the community, in their publication of minimum income standards yesterday. The economy cannot afford to leave statutory minimum incomes so low that costly poverty-related ill health and educational underachievement flood into excellent hospitals and schools, and crime into the courts and prisons; nor to leave those inadequate incomes to reach their beneficiaries through the stressful maze of four statutory agencies. The chaotic housing market adds to the stress of poverty in the UK, with futile attempts to reform the housing benefit system, all of which make poverty worse. The absence of housing supply and the deregulation of lending have combined to lift the cost of housing benefit from £5.4bn in 1988 to £20bn now. The scandal of state-imposed welfare poverty makes people ill and stops their children getting a decent education. It is in the taxpayer’s interest to end poverty with adequate incomes and save billions. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 15 September 2008: A chilling winter of discontent Whitehall has introduced bureaucratic solutions to fuel poverty by making the vulnerable and impoverished apply for social tariffs and insulation (Lofty ideals, September 12). A minister on TV was telling people to make a phone call, apparently not knowing that BT has cut off 1m land lines, and pay-as-you-go mobile phones quickly run out of credit hanging on to “free-phone” calls at 50p a minute. The winter fuel payment is paid direct into pensioners’ accounts, but 1.8 million are not so lucky because they have not applied for pension credit because it is too intimidating, humiliating and fault prone for many of them. Without a direct and uncomplicated injection of cash through the benefit system it is certain that the utility companies will attend the magistrates’ courts with sheaves of applications to break into the homes of impoverished customers who cannot pay their bills to install pay as you go meters, charging the customer both the court costs, and more for fuel than those who pay by direct debit. Come the winter some people in perfectly insulated houses will not have the money to feed the meters or themselves. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 22 December 2008: Moral hazard of forcing people into poverty Polly Toynbee is right to highlight the inadequacy of the unemployment benefit for single adults of £60.50 a week (The prospect of another lost generation is a chilling one, 20 December); it is half the government’s poverty threshold and 42% of the minimum income needed for healthy living as established by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It will increase to just £64.30 in April 2009. Economists and civil servants have always advised politicians about the moral hazard that people will not go to work if their unemployment benefit is too high, but forget the moral hazard when it is below the minimum needed for healthy survival, which is a powerful motivator pushing decent people over the top into immoral and illegal behaviour. That is the danger of fining the unemployed for a failure to engage with the authorities about work or training; benefits are already far too low in this very expensive economy. There is no justice in the government preaching about rights and responsibilities to its poorest citizens when it has not accepted the responsibility to provide adequate minimum incomes in work or unemployment. The minimum wage is a poverty wage in London and many other areas. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 2 January 2009: Churches need to revive a truly rigorous Christian critique of the free market The Bishop of Durham is not as wrong in claiming the poor have got poorer under New Labour, who have called a halt to the rise in the numbers of pensioners and children in poverty under the Conservatives, but failed the very poor. A report by Save the Children in 2005 found that there has been little or no improvement in the proportion of children living in severe poverty since 1997. The Centre Forum calculated the number of people with incomes below 40% of the median income, rather than the government’s poverty threshold of 60%, and found that it had increased by 250,000 between 1994-05 and 2003-04. On the governments measure, the number of childless adults in poverty increased by 500,000 between 1996-97 and 2005-06. Since 2004 the number of children and adults below the government’s poverty threshold has started to increase and this year the rising prices of food, utilities and transport have hit the 2.5 million pensioners and 3.9 million children below the threshold. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 25 March 2009: Support people rather than jobs Polly Toynbee tells of the incredulity of the newly unemployed when they find their benefit is a workhouse rate of £60.50 a week. Incredulity is multiplied by the reply of the government to a debate about increasing it initiated by Julie Jones MP in the third reading of the welfare reform bill. She was told that would fundamentally undermine what the benefits system and the welfare state are there for. The government should re-read the 1942 Beveridge report, which recommended that the benefit scheme should embody principles including unification of administrative responsibility, now shattered into many agencies; and adequacy, totally ignored by all British governments; and added that the aim of the plan for social security is to make want under any circumstances unnecessary. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 11 May 2009: Wealth, poverty and a glaring disparity The 7.5 million adults of working age living in poverty in the UK, an increase of 800,000 since 1998, are often left out of press comment on government statistics. Many are receiving poverty incomes while unemployed, which are due to be sanctioned should they not seek work. John Mason MP, supported by Paul Rowen MP, tabled amendments to the welfare reform bill designed to ensure sanctions do not leave claimants with an income too low to sustain healthy living and are not applied in ignorance of a claimant’s means. The government replied the amendments missed the basic point because there is a contract between the applicant and the state and, if one obeys the rules, no sanctions will be applied. However, rights and responsibilities apply both ways. Since 1948, successive British governments have been signed up to the right to an adequate standard of living as detailed in the UN’s convention on human rights, but have not honoured their side of the contract by implementing that right in adequate unemployment incomes. We hope peers debating the bill will understand that reducing with sanctions £50.95 a week adult unemployment benefit for 18-25-year-olds, or £64.30 thereafter, which is less than half the poverty threshold, can never be justified by a shallow appeal to an unjust social contract. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 22 May 2009: Double blow for poor mothers The tragedy is (Jenni Russell, 21 May) that ministers for decades have swallowed hook, line and bath plug the message of their advisers that an unemployment income below subsistence level at £64.30 a week is needed to force the idle into work. European countries pay 53% to 69% of average earnings to a jobless adult, quite low enough to encourage willing human beings to seek employment, while Britain pays 40%. The welfare reform bill will reduce that £64.30 paid to lone mothers if they do not seek work or engage in work-related activity. Rev Paul Nicolson Chairman, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust 13 June 2009: Welfare bill won’t reduce poverty The welfare reform bill ignores one essential principle, which should inform all of the many regulations about job-seeking conditions, work-related activities etc. Lord Northbourne’s amendment, supported in the debate by the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, but not by the government, requires due consideration to be given to the wellbeing of any child whose life might be affected by the decisions of officials implementing such regulations. The government’s good intentions are marred by an overemphasis on the benefit to a family of parents moving out of unemployment into work. Children become official barriers to work rather than the overriding responsibility of parents. Work is beneficial if it is adequately paid and the children are not harmed because the parental bond is strained or broken when they are put into childcare at crucial stages of their educational and emotional development. The bill has the balance of power wrong at the point where officialdom touches family life. The social security advisory committee questioned the government’s primary analysis that people are unwilling to work and unlikely to work, and need to be coerced into employment. A more socially aware analysis is that parents love their children, want to do their best for them and should have their commitment empowered and encouraged.

As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer. I am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of £67.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS. The self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion, including bonuses, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that £100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas – both out of reach of the taxman. That really is unfair. I hope thousands will join Taxpayers Against Poverty, TAP, to say so loud and clear. All we need is an email.

housing debate has at last embraced the free market in land that is at the root of so many of the UK’s troubles. The Haringey housing battle was about the people’s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages. In the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.

Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford. Hence the 79% increase in homeless families in England to 86,000, including 127,000 children since 2010, some for up to and over 10 years, 1.1 million households on council waiting lists and 4,700 single adults sleeping rough each night. The New Economics Foundation recently reported that the government sold enough public land for developers to build 131,000 homes, but only 2.6% will be for social rent.

Transport use is down, restaurant bookings are non-existent and more people than ever are working from home, according to companies operating across Britain’s technology industries. Globally, use of at-home fitness programmes is soaring, but so too is children’s use of screens, as schools close around the world. Despite pictures of crowded trains circulating on social media, peak London congestion was down two-thirds on Monday morning compared with a typical rush-hour, according to the satnav firm TomTom. In Milan, it was down almost 90%. According to FlightRadar24, only 124 flights left London Gatwick airport on Sunday, compared with more than 400 scheduled on a normal day. Citymapper, a London-based transport app, began publishing a mobility index on Friday, which shows the proportion of normal travel was still occurring in the 41 cities around the world where it operates. London, Birmingham and Manchester all registered huge drops in public transport use, down to 23%, 25% and 26% of normal patterns respectively. British cities, however, sit firmly in the bottom quarter of the index. Thirteen areas have fallen to single-digit percentages, including Milan, Barcelona, New York City and thewhole of the Netherlands. The company’s statistics for London mirror those being studied in government, which the Guardian understands show tube travel down 81% compared to a normal day and bus travel down 69%.
